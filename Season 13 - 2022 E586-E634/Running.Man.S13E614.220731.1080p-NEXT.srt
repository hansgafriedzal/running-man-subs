1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,590
The shoot begins now. Hello.

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,920
Hello.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,160
Hello.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,590
We are Running Man!

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,500
(So Min is acting frivolously
early in the morning.)

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,730
Is it a mission or what?

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,500
I didn't sleep very well.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,140
Look at this. Isn't this cute?

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,410
- This is like a Running Man badge.
- What's that?

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,940
These are badges from some brand.
I got them from someone.

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,030
What is she doing?
Is she getting a mission?

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,500
- Hello.
- You're a spy today.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,280
- Hello.
- We are Running Man!

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,140
Did you get a mission or what?

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,390
Man!

16
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,640
It's delicious, isn't it?

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,040
This is...

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,610
- It's from fans.
- It tastes so good.

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,990
- I ate it already.
- We got churros and...

20
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,990
This isn't product placement.

21
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,150
It's from our fans.

22
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,960
- Thank you so much.
- You want to eat with rice, right?

23
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

24
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,430
- This must be good with rice.
- To celebrate our 12th anniversary.

25
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,530
Did you see the menu?

26
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,600
- My gosh.
- The menu is amazing.

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,930
- It has our names on it.
- It's our names.

28
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,140
The churro is warm.

29
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,710
It tastes so good.

30
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,330
Why do we begin the shoot so early?

31
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,740
I guess he's going on an outing.

32
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,830
Suk Jin, it's hot today.

33
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,350
- You must be hot.
- No.

34
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,450
- It's out of season.
- It looks cool, doesn't it?

35
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,940
Don't I look cool? Haha,
you do have a good fashion sense.

36
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,550
- I think his stylist...
- What?

37
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,740
- is a nice person.
- What about her?

38
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,520
But I don't understand
why she's doing this.

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,360
This is a lot better
than what you're wearing. Look.

40
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,250
- Look at us.
- I hate this.

41
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,360
He says, "This is a lot better
than what you're wearing."

42
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,330
It does look nice,
but why does it have so many studs?

43
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,490
This is fashion.

44
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,490
You must be hot.

45
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,890
- Really?
- It's not right for the weather.

46
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,990
Why not? I'll take it off
after the opening.

47
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,970
You know what he says
when he's flustered.

48
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,240
"Why?"

49
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,660
- I just...
- It does look good.

50
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,830
- Isn't this nice?
- I like it.

51
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,130
It's not so bad.

52
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,030
People are talking a lot...

53
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,940
about Suk Jin's fashion online.

54
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,740
They say he's dressed
like a man in his 20s.

55
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,440
- I know. There was an article.
- That's what fans say.

56
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,940
- Which one?
- Oh, right.

57
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,460
- He looks cool.
- You made your legs too long.

58
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,050
- That's not true.
- You look like Dhalsim.

59
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,830
Actually, my manager
touched it up a little.

60
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,050
- But...
- I don't agree though.

61
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,800
- They look too long.
- The red pants. He wore them...

62
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
- as a penalty, right?
- Right, So Min. That's it.

63
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,890
I took the photo during the shoot.

64
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,930
It's not like he can hide them.

65
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,600
- Right.
- That doesn't look like you.

66
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,610
He covered his face
with sunglasses and a mask...

67
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,500
to create a silhouette
of a man in his 20s.

68
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,130
- What?
- The reporter is so mean.

69
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,450
- That's how the reporter felt.
- So his body is fine.

70
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,050
That doesn't mean anything.

71
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,810
You can always retouch your photo.

72
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,840
Anyway,

73
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,450
he's following in
Im Ha Ryong's footsteps.

74
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,760
- Exactly.
- Ha Ryong is very fashionable.

75
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,050
That's not true.

76
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,890
Seriously, Ha Ryong is
a sharp dresser.

77
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,860
- Right.
- He's quite a dresser.

78
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,200
- He's very fashionable.
- He is.

79
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,120
The difference is that
Suk Jin doesn't own a building.

80
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,830
- Suk Jin does.
- He does?

81
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,860
- No, I don't.
- His wife does.

82
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,800
- He owns land in Paju.
- No, I don't.

83
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,140
- Paju?
- You have an estate in Paju.

84
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,140
Why do you deny it?

85
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,330
I don't own a building.

86
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,400
- I heard that.
- But you have an estate.

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
- Hey.
- He has something in Dongtan.

88
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,430
- What?
- You have one in Dongtan.

89
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,710
- Dongtan?
- Does he have something in Dongtan?

90
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,140
- Hey, stop talking.
- Why?

91
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,770
- In Dongtan?
- Will you disclose all my assets?

92
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,740
Really? Does he have
a building in Dongtan?

93
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,990
How do you know about Dongtan?

94
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,020
- That's all I have.
- It's a secret.

95
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,080
- It's top secret.
- Really?

96
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,550
- So he has 2, not just 1.
- That's enough.

97
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,330
- I didn't know that.
- Right? He hesitated.

98
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,150
- That's true.
- You're a building owner.

99
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,260
- In Dongtan.
- That's not true.

100
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,460
- My gosh.
- It's not a building.

101
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,830
If you say that,

102
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,990
one in a thousand might believe it.

103
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,590
- That's right.
- They would think it's true.

104
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,240
- They believe it and...
- That's the problem.

105
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,430
We need to perform a fact check.

106
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,430
- Right.
- We should be careful.

107
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,080
There's one more thing
I want you to talk about.

108
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,430
- What is it?
- There's a song...

109
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,830
that recently made
a comeback on music charts.

110
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,340
- That's right. I know this song.
- Is it "I Know"?

111
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,710
- That's right. Se Chan.
- I got it first.

112
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,270
- Right.
- What is it?

113
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,920
No!

114
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,810
That's right.
I posted the video clip.

115
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,260
- I know.
- Let's hear it then.

116
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,430
(Se Chan, Yong Jin, and Jin Ho made
their debut as singers in 2008.)

117
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,680
- Se Chan.
- Right.

118
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,330
- You sing pretty well.
- Let's meet them now.

119
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,990
- Music, start.
- Start.

120
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,490
(24-year-old Se Chan)

121
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,670
No!

122
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,040
- Jin Ho and Yong Jin.
- "All I Want Is You".

123
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
No.

124
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,140
You might get
to perform the song again.

125
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,080
- I like the song though.
- Me too.

126
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,800
(Rapper Yang Se Chan)

127
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,180
Gosh, I can't watch this.

128
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,610
(Embarrassed)

129
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,460
Gosh, I can't watch this.

130
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,790
- Hey.
- What's with my hair?

131
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,330
- Look at his hair.
- Hey.

132
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,890
- He's serious.
- Why do you look so serious?

133
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,800
I can't stand the sight of him.

134
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,150
My face is flushed.

135
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,300
- Gosh, it's so annoying.
- I think...

136
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,700
I think I saw him at SBS.

137
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,540
- I posted this...
- Please turn it off.

138
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,210
That's nice.

139
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,680
(He can't stand the sight
of himself from 14 years ago.)

140
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,800
My goodness.

141
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,980
It's really annoying.

142
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,070
(Please help me.)

143
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,610
- What's funny about Se Chan is...
- Isn't that amazing?

144
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,550
He looks so cool
when he holds the microphone.

145
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,550
But it's just Se Chan
when he puts it down.

146
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,990
- I should cover my mouth.
- He's cool with his lips covered.

147
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,050
- Isn't that when you stole a bike?
- No.

148
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,450
- No. I was a singer.
- He pretends to be a celebrity.

149
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,950
To be honest, those three were...

150
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,190
- drunk with popularity back then.
- Right.

151
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,170
- So they were being frivolous.
- I was really arrogant.

152
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,120
- Really?
- I was being condescending.

153
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,760
They were idols
in the comedian world.

154
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,540
They were very condescending.

155
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,200
- I know.
- What's with his hair?

156
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,300
- The back...
- What's that ponytail?

157
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,700
This is...

158
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,680
what a famous hairdresser
in Gangnam did.

159
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,700
- She did it for me.
- Really?

160
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,110
"What are you?" "I'm a rapper."

161
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,350
"You need a ponytail."
That's how I got it.

162
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,920
I didn't like it,
but I had no choice.

163
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,010
And the other idol artists were
surprised to see me.

164
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,590
It's a good memory.

165
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,680
- I got goosebumps.
- It's a nice song though.

166
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,800
All right. Let me tell you
about today's race now.

167
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,030
- Okay.
- Today's race...

168
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
is called the RTT.

169
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,670
It's The Running Tag of Tails.

170
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,170
- What is it?
- You guys will be...

171
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,470
- scattered around Sangam-dong.
- Sangam-dong?

172
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,340
And you will hide your name tags
in places you want.

173
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,570
(The members will hide their names
in places they want in Sangam-dong.)

174
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,870
You can go anywhere in Sangam-dong.
And this is your name tag.

175
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,980
- My gosh.
- How can I hide it?

176
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,420
You can go anywhere in Sangam-dong.

177
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,550
(The race will take place
in the whole neighborhood.)

178
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,180
Gosh, how would we...

179
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,290
(The race will take place
in the whole neighborhood.)

180
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
So are we going to use
the whole area of Sangam-dong?

181
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,250
We will give you this map.

182
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,320
(They will get a map
of Sangam-dong for the race.)

183
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,190
- That's big.
- How is that possible?

184
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,230
And this is your name tag.

185
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,690
- Nice.
- I like that.

186
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,730
- Really?
- Gosh, that's big.

187
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,930
How would we hide it?

188
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,630
We have the rules
about hiding the name tags.

189
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,110
You can't hide it
in a place where you can't find it.

190
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,740
You can't use locks or hide it
in a place that is off limits.

191
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,910
It should be a place
that's easily accessible.

192
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,110
I see.

193
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,810
You should be
able to retrieve it yourself.

194
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,350
These are the rules
you should remember.

195
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,880
Once you hide your name tag,

196
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,310
you can start looking for
other members' name tags.

197
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,920
It won't be easy.

198
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,590
If you find a name tag,
the member will be out.

199
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,620
Really?

200
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,450
And the member
whose name tag is found...

201
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,190
will be your tail.

202
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,670
(The member whose name tag is
found will be the captain's tail.)

203
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,990
That sounds interesting.

204
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,740
If Jae Suk finds Haha's name tag,

205
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,740
Haha will stop his mission...

206
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,870
- and become Jae Suk's tail.
- Jae Suk's tail?

207
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,430
(Those who are eliminated join
the captain's team right away.)

208
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,940
- That's how it goes.
- It will be thrilling.

209
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,500
You will look for
each other's name tags...

210
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,370
until there's only one member left.

211
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,110
For those who have difficulties
finding the name tags,

212
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,680
there will be hint spots.

213
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,510
There will be four mission spots.

214
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,750
If you complete a mission there,

215
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,930
you will get an address
or a photo of the place...

216
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,230
where the name tag
you're looking for is hidden.

217
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,990
It will be easy if I get an address.

218
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,540
It will still be hard to find it
even if you know the address.

219
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,800
- Right.
- I guess so.

220
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,040
- I think a photo would be better.
- And let's say...

221
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,870
Jae Suk gets a hint
about Haha's name tag,

222
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,040
Haha will be told about it.

223
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,870
Haha will hear that Jae Suk got...

224
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,980
the address of the place
where Haha's name tag is hidden.

225
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,980
And if Haha wants,

226
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,990
he can go there and hide
his name tag somewhere else.

227
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,220
But he gets only three minutes.

228
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,450
- And I might run into him there.
- That can happen.

229
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,990
You can hide it again
for three minutes,

230
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,530
- but you can only walk.
- Walk?

231
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,860
Once the time is up, you have to
place your name tag there.

232
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,600
The race will be over
once one of you collects six tails.

233
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,470
- It will be difficult.
- Then we will continue...

234
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,260
- the next race in the SBS building.
- We can do it. It won't be so hard.

235
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,680
Let's start the race then.

236
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,980
- Yes.
- Okay.

237
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,110
(They are ready to start the race.)

238
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,050
- It will be tricky.
- Gosh, this is...

239
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,610
- That's too big.
- It won't be easy.

240
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,110
- It's not easy.
- Where...

241
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,420
- Okay.
- Where should I hide this?

242
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,440
I'm familiar with Sangam-dong.

243
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,790
- I'm not.
- I don't know much about it.

244
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,790
Let's go.

245
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,050
- Shall we go?
- Let's go to Sangam-dong.

246
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,590
- Let's go.
- Shall we go?

247
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,950
Where should we go?

248
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,120
Hang on. I should hide
my name tag first.

249
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,470
- Let's go.
- I know this area inside out.

250
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,120
I'll just put it on the street.

251
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,240
That's all you need to know.

252
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,930
Don't be so uptight.

253
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,560
So Min, listen to me.

254
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,930
I know all the places
in Sangam-dong.

255
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,680
- Let's go.
- So what?

256
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,070
Whatever TV, so what TV,
Jeonsobari TV.

257
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,110
- Whatever.
- I don't care.

258
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,010
You will be my tail anyway.

259
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,680
What did he say? What was that?

260
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,510
- What did you say?
- You'll be my tail.

261
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,860
You will be my tail.

262
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,180
- Hey, So Min.
- My wagging tail.

263
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,730
Why don't we show our teamwork...

264
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,160
after a long time?

265
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,190
Don't fall for it.

266
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,300
- I can't let them win.
- I'm serious.

267
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,820
If you don't want it,
just forget it.

268
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,670
Okay. I'm in.
What do you want to do?

269
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,560
We should stick together.

270
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,370
Okay. Let's go together then.

271
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,280
- Let's go together.
- I'll call you later.

272
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,180
I'm serious. Don't you want to win
the race with me today?

273
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,410
- Okay.
- Okay.

274
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,880
I'll trust him.

275
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,150
Good luck, So Min.

276
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,080
Is that it?

277
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,340
(Suk Jin goes to his car.)

278
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,550
- Is this the car?
- Yes.

279
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,980
Are we moving in this car?

280
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,790
Will Jae Suk drive?

281
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,390
Should I go alone?

282
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,590
Oh, right.
This is an individual game.

283
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,550
This is where I am now.

284
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,220
- Can I go anywhere I want?
- Yes.

285
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,060
Where should I go?

286
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,230
The Community Service Center?

287
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,770
Did you get permission
for the shoot?

288
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,880
You should get permission yourself.

289
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,970
Really?

290
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,800
How would I do that?

291
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,340
- It's up to you.
- Up to me?

292
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,650
Hey, that's...

293
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,470
This is crazy.

294
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,180
Am I supposed to ask
if it's okay to shoot there?

295
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,980
My gosh.

296
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,680
They would let me in though.

297
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,950
They don't mind it in most cases.

298
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,530
My face is like my ID card.

299
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,850
I've been doing this show
for a very long time.

300
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,090
We should go to Sangam-dong first.

301
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,090
I should hide it downtown.

302
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,460
Let me see.

303
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,640
(Jae Suk is thinking
about where to hide his name tag.)

304
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,870
I might come back here later.

305
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,650
Sir, please go to Nanjicheon Pond.

306
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,750
I don't think the other members
have a specific destination yet.

307
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,180
Do you have any plans?

308
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,420
It's not even started yet.
What plan would there be?

309
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,290
- You're not good at hiding things.
- That's not true.

310
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,720
I did stuff like this a lot
on "Infinite Challenge".

311
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,760
Gosh, this is...

312
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,030
I'm...

313
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,960
I'm serious.

314
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,400
This is where I go to walk my dog.

315
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,640
The green ones.
This is where I walk my dog.

316
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,540
I've been to all these places.

317
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,180
I think Pyeonghwa Park.

318
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,620
I should go to Nanjicheon Pond
in Pyeonghwa Park.

319
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,120
They have a nice park there.

320
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,550
My dog is finally helping me
in the race.

321
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,320
My dog is really energetic.

322
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,480
Well... What about...

323
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,950
Can I hide it in the MBC building?

324
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,220
(Can I hide it in the MBC building?)

325
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,090
I'm thinking of going
into the MBC building.

326
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,010
(His idea isn't any different
from Jong Kook's.)

327
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,540
Then...

328
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,510
I'd say...

329
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,780
the beacon does not
shine on its own base.

330
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,070
I think it sounds really cool.

331
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,310
This is what celebrities
like and fear at the same time.

332
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,680
It's the director of
the Variety Production Bureau.

333
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,630
I'll put my name tag under her desk.

334
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,160
- So are you going to SBS?
- Let's go to SBS.

335
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,720
I'd like to meet Young In
after a long time.

336
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,870
And going to Sky Park
can be very tiresome.

337
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,270
The wide field.

338
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,930
But that's what Se Chan would do.

339
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,010
Those who are like...

340
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,570
mice or wild dogs will go there.

341
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,880
But I'm different.

342
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,210
I'll go to Sky Park.

343
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,080
(Haha was right about the mice.)

344
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,840
I'll go to the peak. Okay.

345
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,660
This is war.

346
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,680
(He goes to Sky Park
as Haha predicted.)

347
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,980
Gosh, they will have to...

348
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,660
go all the way up
to the top because of me.

349
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,820
I need an alliance here.

350
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,430
(I need an alliance here.)

351
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,720
- Haha.
- Hey, Se Chan.

352
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,330
I will be your loyal tail.

353
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,830
Don't say that.

354
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,640
I mean it. I need you...

355
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,600
in today's race.

356
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,970
Go ahead and rap for me.

357
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,380
The day I confessed my feelings,
I swore to you

358
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,550
(The rapper
with a ponytail is back.)

359
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,520
(Satisfied)

360
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,550
Haha.

361
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,160
I will tell you where I'm going.

362
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,420
Where are you going?

363
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,980
I'm going to Apartment Ten.

364
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,180
Apartment Ten?

365
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,660
Yes. That's where I'm going.

366
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,300
I just wanted to tell you.

367
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,460
Where are you going?

368
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,590
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Okay.

369
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,140
Se Chan, I'm serious.

370
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,430
- I'm...
- Yes.

371
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,060
going to Sky Park.

372
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,870
I'm going to Sky Park.

373
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,570
- You're going to Sky Park?
- Yes.

374
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,780
I'll put my name tag
in the middle of the open field.

375
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,650
You can go to Sky Park too.

376
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,380
No, why would I go there?

377
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,440
Okay. I'm going to Sky Park.

378
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,750
Okay.

379
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,050
- Bye.
- Bye.

380
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,350
(Se Chan is swayed by Haha's lie.)

381
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,080
I think he's
really going to Sky Park.

382
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,160
I think So Min is...

383
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,260
going to Sky Park now.

384
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,850
- Sky Park?
- Yes.

385
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,630
It must be...

386
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,870
really hot up there.

387
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,300
- You think?
- Yes. It's dangerous.

388
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,060
- Okay. I get it.
- Okay. Bye.

389
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,300
- Bye.
- Bye.

390
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,100
I don't think that's true.

391
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,570
(Se Chan is worried he will meet
the other members at Sky Park.)

392
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,520
There's the ticket office.
Please drop me off here.

393
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,280
I'll go up to the left.

394
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,420
(He arrives at Sky Park
filled with worries.)

395
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,710
My goodness.

396
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,120
Is Haha going to Sky Park?

397
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,350
Hello. Can I buy a ticket now?

398
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,000
- How much is it?
- Three dollars for a round trip.

399
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,170
Three dollars?

400
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,320
Here.

401
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,690
(He buys a ticket for the shuttle.)

402
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,830
If someone...

403
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,060
asks you about me,
please say you didn't see me.

404
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,430
- Okay.
- Thank you.

405
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,770
Thank you.

406
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,880
Let's get on the shuttle.

407
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,970
Oh, dear.

408
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,970
(He gets on the shuttle.)

409
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,970
It feels like
I'm going on an outing.

410
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,380
Here we go.

411
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,890
(It feels like a picnic.)

412
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,920
This is nice.

413
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,760
So Min?

414
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,290
(Se Chan heard
these two were coming here.)

415
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,430
I'm supposed...

416
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,790
to hide this in a place
where people can't find it.

417
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,950
I can dig in the ground, right?

418
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,320
I would need a shovel.

419
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,720
There are a lot of snakes here.

420
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,030
Snakes?

421
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,960
(Nervous)

422
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,040
I should go anyway.

423
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,470
- I'm worried.
- You should be careful.

424
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,380
(So Min calls Haha.)

425
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,300
So Min, is there anything
you need to know? Ask me anything.

426
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,550
Prince Haha.

427
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,440
- Yes?
- Where are you headed?

428
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,650
- Princess So Min.
- Yes?

429
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,680
Princess So Min?

430
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,180
Yes, Prince Haha.

431
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,080
How about we trust each other
since this is the first round?

432
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,320
Yes, let's do that, Haha.

433
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,900
Then I'll trust you and tell you
the truth. I'm serious.

434
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,030
- I'm going to the SBS building.
- I'll trust you too.

435
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,430
(I'm going to the SBS building.)

436
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,730
(Haha told her the truth.)

437
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,370
Then let's meet up there.

438
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,300
You're lying, aren't you?

439
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,910
I'm not lying. Let's meet up there.

440
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,430
Let's meet up there
and get the first hint.

441
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,070
Sounds good. I understand for now.
We're a team, okay?

442
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,650
Okay. Let's meet up
after hiding our name tags.

443
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,750
Princess So Min!

444
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,810
Prince Haha!

445
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,120
Cross!

446
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,350
Gosh. I don't think I can trust her.

447
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,130
At least once... I mean,
she and I have been distant...

448
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,760
for about two years, I think.

449
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,730
There were times when we were
so tight. We rooted for each other.

450
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,730
And we called each other often,
but we became a little distant...

451
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,200
because she kept having doubts
about me.

452
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,470
But I always trust her
although she often fools me.

453
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,800
I really hate where we are now.
I want to get our friendship back.

454
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,710
I want to go back to the days when
I called her "my dear princess".

455
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,020
So I'm going to show her
my passion and affection...

456
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,390
that are as hot as the summer sun.

457
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,790
(Haha arrived at the SBS building
as he promised to So Min.)

458
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,950
(Haha arrived at the SBS building.)

459
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,060
(And he found someone.)

460
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,030
Let's go.

461
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,990
(Haha meets Jong Kook.)

462
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,130
He was too lazy to do so.

463
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,170
- I'm here to see Hwan Jin,
- Yes.

464
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,040
help him promote his new show,
and leave.

465
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,970
- That's sweet of you.
- Yes. I'm here to help him.

466
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,970
- You're so kind.
- Of course.

467
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,020
- I'm just...
- What a coincidence.

468
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,550
- I'm just stopping by.
- I see.

469
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,210
- I'm here to see someone too.
- Right.

470
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,350
I wouldn't hide my name tag here.

471
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,660
- Hold on. So Min might come too.
- Exactly.

472
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,720
Sorry?

473
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,930
Hey, a black vehicle is coming.
Over there.

474
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,120
My goodness. This is awesome.

475
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,430
I think I'll get emotional
if So Min gets out.

476
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,830
(Who could be in the vehicle?)

477
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,770
(The two of them are trying to
recover their faded friendship.)

478
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,730
(Could the prince and the princess
have the same goal?)

479
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,650
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Gosh, it's Suk Jin.

480
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,050
Hey, why did you come here?

481
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,190
Suk Jin is in there.

482
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,290
(Middle-aged men tend to go only
to the places they know.)

483
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,660
You were too lazy to go
somewhere else, right?

484
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,430
Am I right?

485
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,220
I'm not going in there now that I've
seen you and Jong Kook.

486
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,170
Gosh, So Min.
Why on earth can't she trust me?

487
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,200
Think about what you've done to her.
How can she trust you?

488
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,070
There's no way I told him the truth.

489
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,480
I'll hide my name tag
at the place I like.

490
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,750
(What place did So Min choose?)

491
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,340
Aren't you going to talk to
the other members?

492
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,180
You see, I'm not that type.

493
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,560
Are you the type
that's always in last place?

494
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,150
No, not the type
that's always in last place.

495
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,730
I'm the type that figures out
what to do on my own.

496
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,530
(While wandering in Sangam-dong
and talking nonsense...)

497
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,590
Wait. Isn't that our staff's car?
Oh, I think I was wrong.

498
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,160
Our staff members are in that car,
right?

499
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,240
(He found a vehicle
that he assumed to be the staff's.)

500
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,190
- Right?
- I can't tell you that.

501
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,470
I think I'm right.

502
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,740
Sir, can you follow that car,
please?

503
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,400
- Follow that car?
- Yes, please.

504
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,670
(A vehicle caught Jae Suk's eyes.)

505
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,010
Then I'll find one name tag
for sure.

506
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,110
(If I follow the car,
I'll find one name tag for sure.)

507
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,410
We're following it.

508
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,110
We're following that car.

509
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,760
(He smiles from ear to ear
as he gets lucky.)

510
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,060
I wonder who's in that car.

511
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
(While following the car...)

512
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,880
Why is it stopping?

513
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,800
Did they notice we were following?

514
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,360
Hold on. A cameraman is filming
whoever that is.

515
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,890
The cameraman is getting out.
Please drive past the car.

516
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,740
I don't mind if we go past them.
Hold on.

517
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,970
Someone else is getting out.
Who is that?

518
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,330
It's So Min.

519
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,830
It's So Min, right?

520
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,340
(So Min got caught.)

521
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,480
What do you think? No one would know
that it's a name tag, right?

522
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,320
(She's so naive that she doesn't
know what's going on.)

523
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,520
Oh, no. Gosh. No.

524
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,940
My phone.

525
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,940
(And she dropped her phone too.)

526
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,580
Thank you. I'll be back shortly.

527
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,460
Look at her. Sir.

528
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,070
We can go now.
I know she'll be around here.

529
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,930
What time is it now?

530
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,040
(He's watching her to find out
the direction she's moving in.)

531
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,600
(Thinking hard)

532
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,810
But So Min would only annoy me
if she tagged along with me.

533
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,210
I should hide my name tag
before finding hers.

534
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,910
Sir, please drop me off here.

535
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,050
- Here?
- Yes.

536
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,520
Since I've found one member...

537
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,050
(He gets out to hide his name tag
after checking So Min's location.)

538
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,350
Am I at the right place?

539
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,990
(At that time, So Min is also
looking for a place.)

540
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,230
Wait. I should
hide my name tag somewhere...

541
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,470
(He should hide it quickly
so that he can chase So Min.)

542
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,300
and locate her.

543
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,130
It's too hot.

544
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,470
Gosh. So Min is over there.

545
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,930
Hey, move. Come on.

546
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,100
(He found So Min in front of him.)

547
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,250
It's in the DDMC building.

548
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,480
(So Min didn't see Jae Suk
who was right in front of her.)

549
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,340
In which building
is the Channel A office?

550
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,020
Oh, I'm at the wrong place.

551
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,260
(So Min came right behind Jae Suk.)

552
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,120
She's walking past us.
So Min didn't see us.

553
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,230
(So Min couldn't see...)

554
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,190
(Jae Suk and the staff members
who were with him.)

555
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,600
It's so hot.

556
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,210
It's hot, right?

557
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,100
(This man here is Jae Suk.)

558
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,250
So Min... I know. I saw it.
I saw the reflection of her.

559
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,520
I saw her just walking past us
without noticing us.

560
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,460
We just have to go straight.
We'll find it.

561
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,290
(But then...)

562
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,030
(So Min suddenly turns around!)

563
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,890
(And she walks back
the way she came?)

564
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,100
I think...

565
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
(What?)

566
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,330
(Suddenly,
she looks at the utility pole.)

567
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,480
No one could find it
if I hid it here, right?

568
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,580
(She's simply cheerful
when she can't even hide herself.)

569
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,340
I think it's a good idea
to hide it here on the street.

570
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,050
I don't see anyone here.

571
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,910
I think no one is coming here.

572
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,820
She didn't see me, right?

573
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,120
She just walked past me.

574
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,080
She didn't see any of us.

575
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,190
I told you so.

576
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,800
This is why
eliminating her would be pointless.

577
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,390
She went down there, right?

578
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,730
(She even let Jae Suk know
the direction she was moving in.)

579
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,890
I'll hide my name tag first.

580
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Let me think. I think
I should hide it around here.

581
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,330
I should make sure
that no one sees me hiding it.

582
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,810
(Right then...)

583
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,170
(At a place with no passers-by,)

584
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,680
(Jae Suk found a good spot
to hide his name tag.)

585
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,080
(He slid it
under the snow removal box.)

586
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,560
Wait.

587
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,330
They won't tell the others, right?

588
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,390
(He feels anxious
even after hiding it.)

589
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,530
(Jae Suk successfully hid it
without leaving any witnesses.)

590
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,240
(Now, his goal is to catch So Min.)

591
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,160
So Min went down the street
without a particular destination.

592
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,330
(Meanwhile,
Se Chan who went to Sky Park...)

593
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,100
I'm really enjoying riding this.

594
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,050
I feel like I'm going on a picnic.

595
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,340
I feel like
I'm here to promote Seoul.

596
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,640
"Yang Se Chan's Tour of Seoul".

597
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,790
(Yang Se Chan's Tour of Seoul,
Part One)

598
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,260
Nice cornering.

599
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,610
Great job.

600
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,730
(He takes photos of the scenery.)

601
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,190
Sir, is today's weather good
to enjoy the view?

602
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,620
It's too hot in July and August,
so it's off-season now.

603
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,570
(It's off-season at Sky Park
from July to August.)

604
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,890
In July and August?
We came here during the off-season.

605
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,930
When will this air?

606
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,710
- Pardon me?
- "Infinite Challenge".

607
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,980
"Infinite Challenge"?

608
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,100
We're shooting Running Man.

609
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,440
When will this episode of
Running Man air?

610
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,410
This part will make it on air
only if I do well.

611
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,790
If I don't make it interesting,
it could be edited out.

612
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,490
- I'll do my very best. Yes.
- Good luck.

613
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,150
- You explained it to me so kindly.
- I hope it works out well for you.

614
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,760
Thank you.

615
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,120
(Exclaiming)

616
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,920
Look. This is
what Sangam-dong looks like.

617
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,000
It's much prettier than
the night view in Hong Kong.

618
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,090
It's hard to believe that there's
a place like this in Seoul.

619
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,770
Right.

620
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,980
(He's going to hide his name tag.)

621
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,830
I think...

622
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,940
no one will come up here.

623
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,410
My gosh.
There's no one else but us here.

624
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,080
I can't see
how popular this place is now.

625
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,720
It should be crowded with people
enjoying the scenery.

626
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,380
This is a lonely fight.

627
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,090
I want to interview a few citizens.

628
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,730
But I see no one here.

629
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,800
(He found the first citizen
when he came up on the observatory.)

630
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,690
I found another person
who is fighting a lonely battle.

631
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,570
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

632
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,440
Didn't you say you wanted to
interview people?

633
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,180
"Yang Se Chan's Tour of Seoul".

634
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,220
But he doesn't seem to
care about me.

635
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,290
Sir, did you come up here alone?

636
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,490
Did you come here alone? I see.

637
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,850
- We're shooting Running Man.
- I see.

638
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,230
- Yes. I'm Yang Se Chan.
- It must be hard to shoot outside.

639
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,530
It's okay.

640
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,860
Did you ride your bicycle alone
all the way up here?

641
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,000
That's amazing. Wasn't it hard?

642
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,330
- It was, obviously.
- Right.

643
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,330
What do you think?
The scenery is magnificent, right?

644
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,640
(He keeps asking boring questions.)

645
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,280
Enjoy the scenery
and have a great time.

646
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
(Enjoy the scenery
and have a great time.)

647
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,820
(The first interview ended up
in failure.)

648
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,180
Okay. I still have a long way to go.

649
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,820
- Hey, Hwan Jin.
- Hi, Jong Kook.

650
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,820
I came all the way
to the SBS building...

651
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,580
to promote "Go Straight for Crush".
I mean, "Go Straight for Love".

652
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,650
I'm here to help you
promote your new show.

653
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,690
Where are you?

654
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,860
Couldn't you say the right title?

655
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
(The person whom Jong Kook is
looking for is...)

656
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,930
(Lee Hwan Jin,
the former director of Running Man)

657
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,000
(Likes stir-fried pork)

658
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,240
(He directed Running Man
for so long since the beginning.)

659
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:36,600
(He's preparing a new dating show
called "Go Straight for Love".)

660
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,170
(Why did Jong Kook call him
when he's busy preparing the show?)

661
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,480
- I should hide my name tag...
- Is it a poster? What is it?

662
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,820
- My gosh.
- I should...

663
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,460
hide my name tag.
Is there a good spot to hide it?

664
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,880
- Is this really a name tag?
- Yes.

665
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,460
We have to hide our name tags
anywhere in Sangam-dong.

666
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,680
It can be anywhere in Sangam-dong.

667
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,850
- Aren't you a star director?
- Yes, he is.

668
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,030
- He's a star director.
- He'll launch a new show soon.

669
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,230
The word spread widely
among TV celebrities.

670
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,090
We all have our eyes
on your new show.

671
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,430
What's the title of the show?

672
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,600
Isn't it "Love Goes Straight"?

673
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,070
(Isn't it "Love Goes Straight"?)

674
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,780
I said, "Go Straight for Crush".

675
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,480
Is it "Go Straight, No U-Turn"?

676
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,640
When will it premiere?

677
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,720
On August 3.

678
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,980
On August 3? What time?

679
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,220
At 10:30 p.m.

680
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,680
- On August 3.
- August 3.

681
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,760
- At 10:30 p.m.
- At...

682
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,420
- At 10:30 p.m.
- At 10:30 p.m.

683
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,850
"Go Straight for Crush"... No.
"Go Straight..."

684
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,960
- "for Love".
- "For Love".

685
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,260
("Go Straight for Love")

686
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,690
"Go Straight for Love".

687
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,090
My gosh. That was funny.
"Go Straight for Love".

688
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,470
All right. "Go Straight for Love".

689
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,470
- Okay.
- You must hide it by 11:00 a.m.

690
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,270
- Where should I hide it?
- You have to hide it...

691
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,980
in a place that's too obvious.

692
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,630
- Where? What's an obvious place?
- For example...

693
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
No one would search the cafe.

694
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,370
Won't they search the cafe?

695
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,410
Of course, they won't go there
during the opening hours.

696
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,640
- I'm sorry,
- Yes?

697
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,080
but can you hide this
in the cabinet?

698
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,520
- I'll hide it in there.
- Thank you.

699
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,760
- No one will be able to find it.
- Right.

700
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,350
That was easy. Nice.

701
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,060
This won't work.
I'll go somewhere else.

702
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,690
I'll go to the building next to it.
Not far away from it.

703
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,590
- I need permission for shooting?
- You should get permission.

704
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,070
What's in this building?

705
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,270
It's the YTN building.

706
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,470
YTN?

707
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,010
I'm sure they'll let us shoot...

708
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,280
Let's see how it goes.

709
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,010
I'll face it head-on.

710
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,750
(The top star with 30 years of
experience whose face is his ID)

711
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,870
I should hide it
in a hard-to-find place like this.

712
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,110
Excuse me. Hello. We're...

713
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,790
May we shoot our show here
for a while?

714
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,910
- You're shooting a show?
- Yes.

715
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,260
- Please give me a moment.
- Maybe we can't, right?

716
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,060
I'll hide something here and leave.
It's a mission.

717
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,530
- Please wait a moment.
- Sure.

718
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,470
Right. He must talk to someone.

719
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,240
Since it's a news network,
they're very strict...

720
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,830
You said your face was your ID.

721
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,630
Hey, be quiet.

722
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,370
Edit out the part where I said that.

723
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,240
- Yes?
- The person in charge will be here.

724
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,980
- The person in charge? All right.
- Yes.

725
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,170
See? This shows how good
this place is at hiding my name tag.

726
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,610
If I hid it in the office building
of a news network,

727
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,080
then the other members would
do the same thing.

728
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,490
They wouldn't care
what Jae Suk does.

729
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,060
Hello.
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

730
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,060
You must be the person in charge...

731
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,060
- I'm from the security team.
- You're from the security team?

732
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,300
- We're shooting Running Man.
- I see.

733
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,420
I just need to hide this.
May we have permission to shoot?

734
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,630
In that case, you need to talk to
someone from another team.

735
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,860
I see. Oh, you're calling someone.
Wait. I don't have much time.

736
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,630
I understand.

737
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,600
(The top star's face ID doesn't
seem to have much credibility.)

738
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,780
(The employee seems to be in
a difficult position from behind.)

739
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,320
Maybe we won't get permission.
I'm running out of time.

740
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,440
(The phone conversation is
going on for longer.)

741
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,790
I'm embarrassed.
I said my face was my ID.

742
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,530
- Understood.
- Okay. Yes.

743
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,960
I'm sorry, but I was told you must
get approval in advance.

744
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,590
(His ID has been rejected.)

745
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,070
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

746
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,500
Please don't be. It's okay.

747
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
- We can include this scene, right?
- Pardon?

748
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,770
- Probably.
- Yes.

749
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,660
(Mr. ID walks with a hunched back
as he's embarrassed.)

750
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,080
Right. I see why.

751
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,440
(He tries to justify himself
while talking to himself.)

752
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,750
I'm so embarrassed.

753
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,780
Of course,
I should get approval in advance.

754
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,840
I understand. Darn it.

755
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,350
Let's go to the next building.
What's in that building?

756
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,580
- CJ.
- CJ?

757
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,120
Gosh. Why are so many news networks
located around here?

758
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,730
Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

759
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,770
- May we shoot here for a while?
- Hello. Oh, I'm sorry,

760
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,800
but you need to make a request
in advance.

761
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,430
- Right?
- Yes.

762
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,210
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

763
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,240
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

764
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,480
I might run out of time
while trying to get permission.

765
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,810
(Meanwhile,
Jae Suk is hunting for So Min.)

766
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,840
Hello.

767
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,820
Have you seen Jeon So Min?

768
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,490
- No, I haven't.
- No?

769
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,760
She went this way.

770
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,180
(He starts tracing her
at the last place he saw her.)

771
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,820
You're on social media, right?

772
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Can you search posts
about Jeon So Min?

773
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
(Can you search posts
about Jeon So Min?)

774
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,760
Some people post about the places
where they see a celebrity.

775
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,270
That's why I should be careful
not to be spotted.

776
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,660
How smart am I? Right?

777
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,510
- I can't find such posts.
- What are you talking about?

778
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,330
I'll teach you a lesson. Gosh.

779
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,370
(His social media
investigation method failed.)

780
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,900
Seeing that she went this way,

781
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,510
(Detective Yoo decided to
do the footwork in the end.)

782
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,980
she most likely went to
a network's office building.

783
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,640
Hello. Sir, by any chance,
did you see...

784
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,370
a team of staff shooting
on your way here?

785
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,790
I saw Ji Suk Jin over there.

786
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,790
Over there?

787
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,180
(I saw Ji Suk Jin over there.)

788
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,790
Thank you.

789
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,230
(He was tipped off about
Suk Jin's location by chance.)

790
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,650
He was grumbling
while walking around.

791
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,960
I see. Thank you for telling me.

792
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,000
- Hello. May I ask where you work?
- Hello.

793
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,120
- In that building.
- What kind of company is it?

794
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,470
- It's called Dexter Studios.
- Pardon?

795
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,130
Dexter Studios.
That's the company name.

796
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,600
Really? Do you think we can shoot
in your office for a while?

797
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,210
- I don't think so.
- You don't?

798
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,370
Not again.

799
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,780
I'm sorry.

800
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,810
Gosh. This is driving me nuts.
This is the last place...

801
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,250
(When Seok Sam left
to find another place...)

802
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,610
There's one of our members there.

803
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,750
(There's one of our members there.)

804
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,290
Quiet down.

805
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,760
(Detective Yoo noticed
that someone had just passed by.)

806
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,290
I can tell
by seeing where they all look.

807
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,960
Suk Jin is over there.

808
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,290
Ji Suk Jin went that way, right?

809
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,850
He just went inside the building.

810
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,530
- Which building?
- This one.

811
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,120
This building right here?

812
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,530
Did he go into this building?

813
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
All right.

814
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,830
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but...

815
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,660
- You should talk to the manager.
- The manager?

816
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,160
But the manager stepped out.

817
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,370
The manager stepped out?

818
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,280
I'll wait here and go in to find it
after he leaves the building.

819
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,370
Shall I tell you when he comes out?

820
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,670
Please do that.

821
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,610
Hey, So Min.

822
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,110
- Jae Suk.
- Why?

823
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,990
- Have you hidden your name tag?
- Sorry?

824
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,650
I've hidden mine.
I'm having a cup of coffee now.

825
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,850
Really? Where are you?

826
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,120
I'm at this place... You know...

827
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,590
I heard that you were at Sky Park.

828
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,160
- Pardon?
- Sky Park.

829
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,360
No.

830
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,860
Everyone went to Sky Park
to find your name tag.

831
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,000
Really?

832
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,900
I made a lot of good memories
at Sky Park.

833
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,580
Gosh. You're so good at hiding
things like this.

834
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,840
You will never find it.

835
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,080
I'll see you
when you become my tail.

836
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,140
Okay.

837
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,680
I think he hasn't hidden it yet.
He sounded so busy.

838
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,820
He tried to hang up quickly
because he was busy.

839
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,150
You can look for it
after he hides it.

840
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,990
I know. I'll start looking
as soon as he hides it.

841
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,460
What I'm going to do...

842
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,620
(He's going to wait
although it'll take a while.)

843
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,420
is not against the rule, right?

844
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,420
That's right.

845
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,090
It's taking him longer
than I thought.

846
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,740
- Hasn't he hidden it yet?
- Not yet.

847
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,360
I can go in once he hides it.

848
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,370
I guess you'll have to wait
a while longer.

849
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,980
Then how about I find
So Min's first?

850
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,280
(Then how about I find
So Min's first?)

851
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,510
Hold on.

852
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,910
Then... Please...

853
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,280
don't tell Suk Jin you saw me
if you see him again.

854
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,640
- Okay.
- Thank you.

855
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,440
(He leaves after getting
the citizens on his side.)

856
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,060
Entertainers who do variety shows
have this habit.

857
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,650
We tend not to go far away from
the area we often go to.

858
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,060
- Find her name tag first.
- What?

859
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,190
Find her name tag
before saying such a thing.

860
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,090
You know...

861
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,430
that I have a lot of experience
chasing the other members.

862
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,270
No one else has
as much experience as I have.

863
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,660
So Min just called me, right?

864
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,870
(Detective Yoo found out that So Min
was having coffee at a cafe.)

865
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,330
She said
she was having coffee at a cafe.

866
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,640
For example, when I see a place
like this, a burger place,

867
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,340
I can just ask if they saw her.

868
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,340
I'll just ask them the question
even though I know nothing.

869
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,610
Hello.
Have you seen Jeon So Min here?

870
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,320
No? All right. Hello.

871
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,330
Did Jeon So Min come here,
by any chance?

872
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,560
- I didn't see her.
- Okay. Thank you.

873
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,000
Has Jeon So Min come here, sir?

874
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,350
- Who?
- Jeon So Min.

875
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,730
- No, she hasn't.
- I see.

876
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,620
- Have you seen Jeon So Min here?
- Who?

877
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,270
- Jeon So Min.
- No.

878
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,000
You haven't seen her? Hello.

879
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,660
(Unlike his expectation,
she doesn't seem to have come here.)

880
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,980
I found So Min. There she is.

881
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,080
(Right then!)

882
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,980
(So Min appeared?)

883
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,290
(So Min showed up in front of him
right at that moment.)

884
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,380
(Here's how So Min ended up
showing up in front of him.)

885
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,760
There's a place I want to go to.

886
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,260
A friend of mine runs a cafe.
Can I hide it at his cafe?

887
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,890
It's in the DDMC building.

888
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,890
(So Min went to her friend's cafe
to hide her name tag.)

889
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,660
(Gosh. So Min is over there.)

890
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,130
Hey, move. Come on.

891
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,430
(Without knowing that
he had found her,)

892
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,740
(she focused on finding the cafe.)

893
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,540
She's walking past us.
So Min didn't see us.

894
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,670
- Hello. Can I hide this here?
- Sure.

895
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,170
Please don't tell anyone
that I hid this here.

896
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,220
Okay? Make sure not to tell anyone.

897
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,490
What do I do?
I'm running out of time.

898
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,580
(She hid her name tag
behind the cafe's promotion poster.)

899
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,150
Could anyone find this?
I bet no one can find it.

900
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,530
Let's have a cup of coffee
before leaving.

901
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,920
Order what you want.

902
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,620
There's no way they can find it.

903
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,730
(She got excited
and had a photo taken.)

904
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,040
It was so easy.

905
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,690
Whenever I come here...

906
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,540
After having udon and rice balls,

907
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,930
we have coffee here.

908
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,310
(While she enjoys her free time
sipping coffee)

909
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,010
- Jae Suk's over there.
- Jae Suk's in the building.

910
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,580
(Startled)

911
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,170
Hurry. We need to hide.

912
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,580
Come on. We must hide. Oh, no.

913
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,220
Thank you so much.

914
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,640
Gosh. We need to hide immediately.

915
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,460
We have to hide right away.

916
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,720
Hurry up and hide. Oh, no!

917
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,150
Oh, no.

918
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,150
(She makes a run for it
with her ponytail waving.)

919
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,150
(Screaming!)

920
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,390
So Min's worried, isn't she?

921
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,690
That means
she hid it here somewhere.

922
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,190
(She made a run for it
into Jae Suk's line of sight.)

923
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,300
So Min, come on.

924
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,040
Where were you just now? Hello.

925
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,570
- Hello.
- Hello.

926
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,930
(The master pursuer closes the gap.)

927
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,130
Where were you just now?

928
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,670
You must've hid yours around here.

929
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,670
(Chuckling)

930
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,610
You must be here
because you hid it close by.

931
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,580
- Yours must be hidden here too.
- What?

932
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,880
- You hid yours here too.
- Right.

933
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,910
(So Min is close to getting caught.)

934
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,410
Hold on. I must look for it then.

935
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,850
She seemed really worried just now.

936
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,190
I should see where she's going.

937
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,690
Where did he come from?

938
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,830
(She puts distance between
her and Jae Suk first.)

939
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,960
So Min,

940
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,900
where are you off to in a hurry?

941
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,710
How are you here out of all places?

942
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
- Where are you going?
- How...

943
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,710
I wouldn't have been that scared
if I had seen a ghost.

944
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,210
Where are you off to in a hurry?

945
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,250
Well...

946
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,580
- Jae Suk, I...
- So Min,

947
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,340
this is how you react
when you're flustered.

948
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,920
How can you be here out of
all the places in this neighborhood?

949
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,090
How did you know to come here?

950
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,250
Why are you leaving the building?

951
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,420
(Why are you leaving the building?)

952
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,790
- Well, it's...
- Are you moving away...

953
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,130
from where you hid your name tag?

954
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,690
I'm thinking that you
hid yours around here.

955
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,360
- Is that so?
- Yes.

956
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,630
(Just then...)

957
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,170
(Detective Yoo
has his eyes on something.)

958
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,340
- So Min.
- Yes?

959
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,170
- Can I take a sip?
- No, you can't.

960
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,190
Just a sip.

961
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,810
(He finds out
which cafe So Min visited.)

962
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,900
Here you go.

963
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,770
Go, just go!

964
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,000
Get going.

965
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,710
- Go!
- Let me see.

966
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,940
Can you come over here for a second?

967
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,670
- No, you can't.
- Come over here.

968
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,150
- Just a second.
- You can't!

969
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,190
No, you can't. Wait!

970
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,810
- Jae Suk, this is wrong.
- How so?

971
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,060
"With more coffee."

972
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,590
- "All day."
- Don't.

973
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,150
(So Min's close
to losing the race...)

974
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,130
(only after 15 minutes
of hiding her name tag.)

975
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,090
This is the place.

976
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,110
(He's where So Min
hid her name tag.)

977
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,540
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

978
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,810
Didn't Jeon So Min come by?

979
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,980
- No, she didn't.
- She wasn't here.

980
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,310
- Isn't this yours?
- It isn't.

981
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,650
You seem highly flustered.

982
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,580
This is the place.

983
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,880
Jae Suk.

984
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,110
Jae Suk!

985
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,190
Why aren't you leaving this spot?

986
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,310
(Jae Suk keeps questioning them.)

987
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,920
So that I can take orders.

988
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,630
Right, I see.

989
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,290
Just a second.

990
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,520
This.

991
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,690
She was in such a rush
that she forgot her phone.

992
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,340
(She was in such a rush
that she forgot her phone.)

993
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,130
I mean...

994
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,730
Jae Suk's in the building.

995
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,270
(When she was caught earlier)

996
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,980
(She left her phone on the table.)

997
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:19,670
(She made a run for it
but left her phone.)

998
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,610
Things must've been
that urgent for her.

999
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,810
This... I mean...

1000
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,650
(He can't make an excuse for her.)

1001
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,980
- Even a drink was left behind.
- Jae Suk.

1002
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,020
Jae Suk, let's go play...

1003
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,060
- the 2-on-2 game.
- What?

1004
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,960
- The 2-on-2 game.
- So Min.

1005
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,460
- What?
- You left this behind.

1006
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,900
(You must've been in a rush.)

1007
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,270
(Gosh!)

1008
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,590
- Jae Suk, I...
- And this.

1009
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,900
You must've just
popped the straws in.

1010
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,170
(You must've just
popped the straws in.)

1011
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,210
- Right?
- Jae Suk, hold on.

1012
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,360
Let's go for now.

1013
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,940
Just a second.

1014
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,770
- Why...
- So Min, wait.

1015
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,380
You hid it here somewhere.

1016
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,880
No, I didn't hide it here.

1017
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,920
You can't.

1018
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,310
Jae Suk, what can I
do for you right now?

1019
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,590
Let's go play the 2-on-2 game first.

1020
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,750
- Jae Suk.
- I know this is inappropriate,

1021
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,980
but could I...

1022
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,250
- You must put on the apron and cap.
- Is that so?

1023
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,790
Jae Suk, must you go this far?

1024
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,830
- You shouldn't go this far.
- I'm not taking it too far.

1025
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,090
Let's go play the 2-on-2 game.

1026
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,590
So Min, give me a second.

1027
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,040
Why...

1028
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,190
I apologize for the inconvenience.

1029
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,900
- I'm really sorry about this.
- It's all right.

1030
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,810
I won't touch any of the food.

1031
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,130
This is bad. What am I going to do?

1032
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,980
Why did you let him
see your coffee cup?

1033
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,040
(Why did you let him
see your coffee cup?)

1034
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,190
(The master pursuer investigates
where So Min was at.)

1035
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,310
I'm really sorry about this.

1036
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,310
(The master pursuer investigates
where So Min was at.)

1037
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,980
(A part of the name tag
can be seen behind him.)

1038
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,650
- When the owner gets here...
- That's why...

1039
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,650
I can't rummage through the drawers.

1040
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,920
- The owner will be here soon.
- Right.

1041
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,900
(Jae Suk hovers around
where the name tag is.)

1042
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,130
I can see a part of it.

1043
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,500
- I can see it.
- This...

1044
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,840
What do I do?

1045
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:54,810
(Will Jae Suk be able
to find the name tag?)

1046
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,840
When the owner gets here.

1047
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,920
When the owner gets here...

1048
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,150
(He leaves without saying anything.)

1049
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,250
I'm sorry about this.

1050
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,310
He just left which means
he hasn't seen it.

1051
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,980
Even though
it can be seen from here.

1052
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,230
(Jae Suk just leaves the kitchen.)

1053
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,650
This was stuck on here, right?

1054
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,000
Can I have my phone back?

1055
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,650
- Let's go play the 2-on-2 game.
- Just a moment.

1056
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,960
Give me a second.

1057
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,690
(But...)

1058
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,560
- Why did I leave my phone behind?
- Can you hold this for me?

1059
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,090
We should get going.

1060
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,900
- Got it.
- Let's go play the 2-on-2 game.

1061
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,040
- Let's get going for now.
- All right.

1062
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,040
(Oh, no!)

1063
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,650
What do I do? I think he found it.

1064
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,290
(He checks the exterior
of the cafe.)

1065
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,290
Gosh.

1066
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,190
(Ripping off)

1067
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,630
So Min has been eliminated!

1068
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,730
(So Min has been eliminated.)

1069
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,090
How can you do this to me, Jae Suk?

1070
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,400
Come on.

1071
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,860
(Ms. Tail is close
to being in tears.)

1072
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,000
Why did you even come here?

1073
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,230
I worked hard to put that there.

1074
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,540
(So Min becomes his tail
30 minutes into the game.)

1075
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,480
- A lot of thinking went into it.
- Come on.

1076
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,710
You're my tail now.

1077
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,840
Here.

1078
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,650
(He gives her the phone back
and claims her as his tail.)

1079
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,150
- So Min...
- Put it on.

1080
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,560
- Put it on already.
- You must put this on.

1081
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,980
Honestly though.
Why did you come here?

1082
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,090
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

1083
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,330
Gather around, then.

1084
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,650
Once again, I apologize.
It turned out to be outside.

1085
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,130
But the race just started!

1086
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,790
How is this fair?

1087
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,940
- An ice Americano.
- Got it.

1088
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,090
Three of them.

1089
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,460
We'll take three of those.

1090
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,610
So Min, you must stay
with Jae Suk from now on.

1091
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,630
Help Jae Suk
complete his missions...

1092
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,940
- and you'll earn extra points.
- How many points?

1093
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,150
It depends on how well he does
on his missions.

1094
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,480
- Captain!
- Right.

1095
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,090
I'm sorry to ask,
but where did you hide yours...

1096
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,190
and why did you come here?

1097
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,210
Thank you.

1098
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,360
Where did you hide yours?

1099
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,380
That I can't tell you.

1100
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,230
You should know that...

1101
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,560
you weren't aware of my presence
down by the bus stop.

1102
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,230
(Shocked)

1103
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,440
What the...

1104
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,960
- Were you at the bus stop?
- You walked past me.

1105
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,210
(While the first captain
was being crowned...)

1106
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,110
(Se Chan is still
seeing the sights of Seoul.)

1107
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,710
- Hello.
- Hello.

1108
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,670
- Hello.
- Hi.

1109
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,880
- Hi.
- Hello.

1110
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,420
- Do you know me?
- Yes, you're on Running Man.

1111
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,210
(Running Man)

1112
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,360
My gosh.

1113
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,810
Yes, you're on Running Man.

1114
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,730
(Running Man)

1115
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,690
My gosh.

1116
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,500
- Can we take a photo?
- Okay, thank you.

1117
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,920
Sure.

1118
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,060
(He's glad to receive this request.)

1119
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,560
We're from Singapore.

1120
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,960
Oh, Singapore.

1121
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,340
Singapore. Marina Bay, right?

1122
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,630
- Yes, Marina Bay.
- I know Marina Bay.

1123
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,860
Singapore, gosh.

1124
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,000
This is nice.

1125
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,840
It's our first time in Korea.
Nice to meet you.

1126
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,440
Are you here on business?

1127
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,150
(Are you here on business?)

1128
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,840
- On holiday.
- I see.

1129
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
That's right.

1130
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,110
Now...

1131
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
Do you like the view up here?

1132
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,790
- Yes.
- Yes, it's lovely.

1133
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,360
- Amazing?
- Yes, amazing.

1134
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,590
- Okay.
- It's beautiful.

1135
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,420
Let me hold this up. Just a second.

1136
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,920
(Yang Se Chan)

1137
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,170
In 1, 2, 3.

1138
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,670
(After talking briefly,
they take a meaningful photo.)

1139
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,770
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1140
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,690
- It was nice seeing you.
- Bye.

1141
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,230
(They immediately part ways
after taking the photo.)

1142
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,840
Have a good time.

1143
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,480
How can I tell them
to enjoy their trip?

1144
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,340
Enjoy.

1145
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,880
Have a nice day.

1146
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,310
- You too.
- Take care.

1147
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,540
Yes, enjoy.

1148
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,980
- Bye.
- Thank you, bye.

1149
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,790
(Chuckling)

1150
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,750
What on earth are we filming today?

1151
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,560
I need to hide this, right?

1152
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,630
Yang Se Chan's Tour of Seoul.

1153
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,590
This is our last episode...

1154
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,290
and I got to meet foreign tourists.

1155
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,290
I was able to enjoy
the affection we have for the city.

1156
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,500
Now, I'll find a spot
to hide my name tag.

1157
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,130
(Now that the tour has ended,
Se Chan's off to hide his name tag.)

1158
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,500
We're currently here on the map.

1159
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,380
We're crossing over here
and headed this way.

1160
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,080
I couldn't make it
to the first floor.

1161
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,440
(Where did Ji Hyo
hide her name tag?)

1162
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,610
Here.

1163
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,560
Let's go someplace nearby.

1164
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,860
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook takes on
the one-man mission.)

1165
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,560
I love cold chicken noodles,
you know.

1166
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,860
Hello, everyone. Okay!

1167
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,690
- Is this a one-man mission?
- Yes.

1168
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,360
But there's still another chair.

1169
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,290
This is
an individual mission called...

1170
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,770
About You.

1171
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,940
(About You)

1172
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,940
You'll have three minutes
to freely interview...

1173
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,000
the staff member that we choose.

1174
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,210
To win, you must answer...

1175
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,980
two out of the three
predetermined questions.

1176
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,340
Got it.

1177
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,040
I'll go with the camera director.

1178
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,080
(Camera director, Park Sung Bae)

1179
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,520
I'll start by asking you your name.

1180
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,880
He's already here. Keep going.

1181
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,420
- His name.
- Right.

1182
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,860
- And go.
- How much time do I have?

1183
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Three minutes. Ready...

1184
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,060
(He has 3 minutes to get
as much information as he can.)

1185
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,360
Three minutes. What's your name?

1186
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,860
It's Park Sung Bae.

1187
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,170
Park Sung Bae. Right.

1188
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,060
Park Sung Bae.

1189
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,230
Just a second.
It doesn't feel right though.

1190
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,690
What if they hear
the information I get...

1191
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,810
- and ask non-related questions?
- Exactly.

1192
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,310
The questions
have been predetermined.

1193
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,480
- Is that so?
- That's how it should be.

1194
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,770
So the questioning... Got it.

1195
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,170
What can I ask him?
What should I know?

1196
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,310
Your shoe size.

1197
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,210
My shoe size is 275mm.

1198
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,380
Right, 275mm.

1199
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,710
They don't look that big.

1200
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,650
Be quiet over there. Your vision.

1201
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,150
- I bet he has bad vision.
- My vision...

1202
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,360
- is around 0.2.
- Got it.

1203
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,520
How tall are you?

1204
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,920
Around 174cm.

1205
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,560
- No way. I say 172cm.
- Right, 174cm.

1206
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,500
- It's 172cm.
- Be quiet over there!

1207
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,270
- It's 172, not 174.
- Got it.

1208
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,500
What else can I ask?

1209
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,460
What else should I ask about him?

1210
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,000
Which clan of Park are you from?

1211
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,230
- Miryang.
- Miryang.

1212
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,340
- Of course it's Miryang.
- Can you stay quiet?

1213
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,110
- Parks are mostly from Miryang.
- Park of Miryang Clan?

1214
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,380
I'm going to go look for Hwan Jin.

1215
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,540
I'm taking a risk by doing this.

1216
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,880
(Haha is looking for Director Lee?)

1217
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,560
- You left it with Hwan Jin?
- Yes.

1218
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,650
I'll get going, then.

1219
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,130
Cafe? Which cafe
are you talking about?

1220
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,150
If you were to hide a name tag,
you must hide it somewhere obvious.

1221
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,920
- Like where?
- For instance...

1222
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,230
(Haha was watching them from afar.)

1223
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,330
It's room number two. Right?

1224
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,170
(So Haha visits Director Lee's
new projection room.)

1225
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,630
It's fun.

1226
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,810
It looks fun already.

1227
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,810
(Flattering without even
watching the show)

1228
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,710
- It's "Go Straight for Love".
- Isn't that the show...

1229
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,650
that will air
on August 3, at 10:30 p.m?

1230
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,210
"Go Straight for Love"?
It looks fun already. It's crazy.

1231
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,150
This will be a hit.

1232
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,750
Where is the name tag?

1233
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,520
(This will be a hit.
Where is the name tag?)

1234
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,150
Until when
will you be his underling?

1235
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,190
It will air at 10:30 p.m.

1236
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,460
"Go Straight for Love"!

1237
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,840
(Clapping for no reason)

1238
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,060
Hwan Jin, this is your chance.

1239
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,460
(The name tag thief
is setting the scene.)

1240
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,610
This is your chance.
Where is the name tag?

1241
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,400
I can promote your show
about 5,000 times.

1242
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,710
"Go Straight for Love"!

1243
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,310
Today is your only chance.

1244
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,380
- Haha.
- Yes.

1245
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,810
This is the hint.

1246
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,310
(A coffee sleeve?)

1247
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,380
(Haha earned a big hint
on where Jong Kook's name tag is.)

1248
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,630
You're the best.

1249
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,750
I'll go find it now.

1250
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,230
(After giving him a hug,
Haha sets out to find the name tag.)

1251
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,250
Hello.

1252
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,000
(Exclaiming)

1253
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,460
This is so fun! Gosh.

1254
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,340
I've never been so excited
on Running Man.

1255
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,310
Which high school did you go to?

1256
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,000
So it's at a cafe.
All right. Let's go.

1257
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,110
Hello.

1258
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,440
I'm on the same team as Jong Kook.

1259
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,480
(He starts lying shamelessly.)

1260
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,110
I swear. I'm on the same team
as Director Lee too. I'm serious.

1261
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,920
Look. What we hid before.
It says "Hwan Jin", right?

1262
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,630
- Sorry?
- I need to take...

1263
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,330
what Jong Kook left here.

1264
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,360
I'm serious! It's for real.

1265
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,190
We're on the same team.

1266
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:35,040
(The staff brings something
to Haha.)

1267
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,960
- All right. My gosh.
- Is this the one?

1268
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,040
Thank you.

1269
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,080
(Haha acquired
Jong Kook's name tag.)

1270
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,040
No, we're on the same team.

1271
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,650
- I don't think so.
- We're on the same team.

1272
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:45,880
(Haha got Jong Kook as his tail
pretending to be an errand boy.)

1273
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,310
(Kim Jong Kook)

1274
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,440
We're a team now.

1275
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,290
Why are you laughing?

1276
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,960
Hwan Jin did something sly,
didn't he?

1277
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,420
But I promoted his show a lot.

1278
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,420
(Going to Haha while fuming)

1279
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,690
How can he betray me?

1280
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,560
Jong Kook is so funny.

1281
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,670
He's so simple-minded.

1282
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,060
I'm calling Jong Kook.

1283
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,060
I got a scary tail.

1284
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,670
The tail could become crazy,
so I should be careful.

1285
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,480
I need to be nice to him.

1286
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,580
He gets mad if I get cheeky.

1287
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,020
He's coming.

1288
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,770
See? I'm being so polite already.

1289
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,210
Is this the car?

1290
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,020
Hello, Mr. Tail!

1291
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,560
- Hey, you punk.
- Hello, sir.

1292
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
- You punk.
- Please get in.

1293
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,730
- Sit over here.
- All right.

1294
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,560
- Okay.
- You know me, right?

1295
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,330
- Sure. Good job.
- I'll treat you real good today.

1296
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,400
- You're only a tail by the title.
- Oh, gosh.

1297
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,670
- Please support me.
- Go ahead.

1298
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,940
I'll do my best.

1299
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,130
- Just be the captain here.
- All right, sir.

1300
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,560
- Captain!
- Don't even call me that.

1301
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,230
- Captain! Just be one.
- No, I'm not a captain.

1302
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,940
- You can do whatever you want.
- I'm Little Captain.

1303
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,710
- Little Captain. LC.
- LC.

1304
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,880
- Not a boomer but an LC.
- Yes, I'm LC.

1305
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,040
- That sounds great.
- That sounds good.

1306
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,090
- Gosh, it sounds good.
- You're LC.

1307
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,020
We should go and get Suk Jin.

1308
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,920
- I mean...
- I'll get the weak ones first.

1309
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,190
Tell me where he hid it.

1310
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,520
- Come here.
- Please.

1311
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,860
You should tell me about yours too.

1312
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,830
No, I can't. Why? Because you'll
text others about it for sure.

1313
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,360
Hurry up!

1314
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,090
(Sighing)

1315
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,000
Gosh, I became an underling
as soon as the race started.

1316
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,810
Hurry up!

1317
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,000
I'm going after Suk Jin now.

1318
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,710
(Captain Yoo's next target
is Seok Sam.)

1319
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:25,540
I know where Suk Jin's name tag is.

1320
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,810
What's more important is that...

1321
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,750
once I'm at the place where he hid
his name tag,

1322
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,150
I can tell where he hid it
by my hunch.

1323
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,590
Gosh, seriously!

1324
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,360
Hurry up.

1325
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,560
What is this?

1326
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,670
Seon Myung, put on the vest.

1327
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,460
Hurry up and put it on.

1328
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,060
- These guys are out of it.
- What is this? I'm like Bo Pil now.

1329
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:51,900
So Min, this is like a field trip
for you. Watch and learn.

1330
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,940
Come here. I'll show you.

1331
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,750
- Look here.
- Hello.

1332
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,400
- Jae Suk.
- You have to check the passersby.

1333
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,270
They'll look like they want to share
where the members are...

1334
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,440
if they saw one.

1335
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,090
(Take a hint from the passersby
who wants to share things with us.)

1336
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,290
Hold this.

1337
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,460
(Hold the coffee.)

1338
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,810
(While Tail Jeon carries out
her role as an errand girl...)

1339
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:08,980
Gosh.

1340
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,690
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1341
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:16,630
Suk Jin just received a hint
on the location of your name tag.

1342
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,920
He won't be able to find it anyway.

1343
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,900
(Suk Jin got a hint
on where Jae Suk's name tag is?)

1344
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,630
Here's the second question.

1345
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,770
Seoul!

1346
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,480
- The answer is...
- It is Seoul.

1347
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,580
- All right!
- Correct.

1348
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
We'll give you a hint on the
location of the member you pick.

1349
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,340
I pick Jae Suk.

1350
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,940
Would you like the picture
or the address of it?

1351
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,690
(He can get an address or a picture
of the place...)

1352
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,710
(Jae Suk hid his name tag.)

1353
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,520
I'll go with the address.

1354
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,630
Oh, right.

1355
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,650
(That's how Suk Jin
got the address of the location.)

1356
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,460
Mount Maebong is around here?

1357
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,960
Let's go to 37, Maebongsan-ro.

1358
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,000
I must make Jae Suk my tail.

1359
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,340
(While Suk Jin is on the way
to find Jae Suk's name tag...)

1360
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,500
Did you see Ji Suk Jin
around here?

1361
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,440
- No.
- You didn't?

1362
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,980
Hello.

1363
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,080
Did Ji Suk Jin come here earlier?

1364
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,150
I haven't seen him.

1365
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,440
You haven't? I see.

1366
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,020
Oh, Jae Suk prefers
the analog method.

1367
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,690
So he likes to ask around.

1368
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,610
Did you see Ji Suk Jin
around here?

1369
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:13,710
(Doing legwork and asking around)

1370
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:14,960
He was here, right?

1371
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,130
No, I haven't seen him.

1372
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,790
There's not a good spot
to hide your name tag here.

1373
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,130
They'll find my name tag right away
if they get the address.

1374
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,000
Sir, how long will it take?

1375
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,270
- It's about 2km away.
- Oh, it's nearby.

1376
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,460
Jae Suk, let's go get hints.

1377
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,310
Can we?

1378
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,840
(Jae Suk was all confident, but
he is about to get eliminated.)

1379
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,400
Jae Suk.

1380
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,980
(He's slowly looking around
the place he got intel on.)

1381
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,710
Jae Suk, let's go get hints.

1382
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,150
Hold on. I have to find
Suk Jin's name tag...

1383
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,210
before he finds mine.

1384
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,610
- Otherwise...
- It'll be over once he finds it.

1385
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:46,690
Exactly.

1386
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:47,980
Hold on. It must be around here.

1387
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,790
How can we find it
when we have no hints at all?

1388
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,980
- So Min, hold my coffee.
- Okay.

1389
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,630
(Jae Suk heads inside
the cafe in front of him.)

1390
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,830
This is bad.
I might run out of time.

1391
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:57,920
(Actually, this cafe is...)

1392
00:49:58,670 --> 00:49:59,900
Gosh. All right. I'll hide it here.

1393
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,940
(It's the cafe Suk Jin went to
when he was running out of time.)

1394
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,460
I'm sorry, but can I hide this here?

1395
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,610
The other members might come find
it, so don't give them any hints.

1396
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:07,940
- Is this Running Man?
- Yes, it is.

1397
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,980
Here. My name tag.

1398
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:09,980
(He's wearing his clothes
with no name tag.)

1399
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,400
Who is your favorite member
of Running Man?

1400
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,710
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk? I see.

1401
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:15,790
What?

1402
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,290
- You want me to hold your coffee?
- Hello.

1403
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,340
(He enters the cafe
where Suk Jin hid his name tag.)

1404
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,810
Did Suk Jin come by?

1405
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,960
- Did Suk Jin come by?
- No.

1406
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,150
- He didn't?
- No.

1407
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,360
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1408
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,830
Okay. Thank you.

1409
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,400
- Have a good day. Hello.
- Bye.

1410
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,230
- Hello.
- Please don't leave!

1411
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,590
- Have a good day.
- Don't go!

1412
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,270
It's here!

1413
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,400
What is?

1414
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,670
(It's here!)

1415
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,210
(Jae Suk's fan hurriedly told him.)

1416
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,340
Suk Jin is here?

1417
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,610
(Jae Suk's fan hurriedly told him.)

1418
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,610
(Jae Suk comes back in.)

1419
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,670
Where is it?

1420
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,310
(Hesitating)

1421
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,040
Suk Jin is looking for my name tag,

1422
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,790
so I'll be in trouble
if I don't find his first.

1423
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,020
- Really?
- Yes.

1424
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:56,150
I know you might feel guilty,
but I might get eliminated.

1425
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:59,900
(Right then, Seok Sam calls him.)

1426
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,960
Hey, Suk Jin.

1427
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,960
Where are you?

1428
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,400
You know where I am.

1429
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,440
So you hid your name tag
at Maebongsan-ro.

1430
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,670
Try and look for it.

1431
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,460
Yes, I will.

1432
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,130
You came
to this cafe earlier, right?

1433
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,630
A cafe?

1434
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,580
You came
to this cafe earlier, right?

1435
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,040
(Laughing awkwardly)

1436
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,790
(It's obvious that he's flustered.)

1437
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,090
(Laughing awkwardly)

1438
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:27,090
- Suk Jin.
- I went to many cafes.

1439
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,590
- You can't find that cafe.
- Should I look for it?

1440
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,750
What did you say?

1441
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,130
What? A video call?

1442
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,590
You're there?

1443
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,170
(Hello.)

1444
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,190
(Reuniting with the cafe staff
he saw earlier)

1445
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,400
Hello.

1446
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,960
- You seem very surprised.
- That's not true.

1447
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,110
I took a photo with her earlier.

1448
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:47,730
I see.

1449
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,750
Thankfully,
they let me in their storage.

1450
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,880
So I came in here
even though it's an inconvenience.

1451
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,650
- I see.
- Yes.

1452
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,380
Go ahead and look for it.

1453
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,440
Okay.

1454
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,590
Darn it. How did he find the cafe?

1455
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,190
It makes no sense.
How did he find it?

1456
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,790
He didn't even earn a hint, did he?

1457
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,230
He must've asked around.

1458
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,790
Is this the place?

1459
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,560
Gosh, what's with Jae Suk?
How did he...

1460
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,340
How did he find the cafe?

1461
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,500
(Now it's a matter of time before
either one finds the name tag.)

1462
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,610
You told me no one has
succeeded in the mission.

1463
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,940
(If he turns the corner, he'll find
the spot Jae Suk hid his name tag.)

1464
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,480
It seems like he found the cafe
by coincidence.

1465
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,610
(But Suk Jin heads straight
into the building.)

1466
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,110
They gave us their permission
to film in here?

1467
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:27,810
Hello.

1468
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,750
Did Jae Suk drop by here,
by any chance?

1469
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,310
- No.
- He didn't? Okay, thank you.

1470
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,560
This is driving me crazy.

1471
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,630
Tell me up to where I can go in.

1472
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:38,880
- Can I go in this much?
- You can go in.

1473
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,960
- I can go inside?
- Yes.

1474
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,000
(Jae Suk begins searching
after getting their permission.)

1475
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,730
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1476
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,090
(But Jae Suk seems lost too.)

1477
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:47,130
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

1478
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:51,400
Didn't Jae Suk stop by here?

1479
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,480
- No.
- He didn't?

1480
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,080
- All right. Thank you.
- Okay.

1481
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,380
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

1482
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,540
Then where is it?
Where did he hide it?

1483
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,520
Is it outside?

1484
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,340
Did he hide it outside?

1485
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,420
If he came inside the building,

1486
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,090
he'd have asked where to hide it,
given his personality.

1487
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,880
(While Suk Jin and Jae Suk are
madly looking for the name tag...)

1488
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,020
Gosh, where could it be?

1489
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,000
- Are you filming Running Man?
- Yes.

1490
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,230
Has anyone seen a member
of Running Man?

1491
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,500
No one?

1492
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,230
I wouldn't tell you even if I did.

1493
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,230
Tell me. I'm eliminated anyway.

1494
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,710
Hello, I'm So Min.

1495
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:28,210
Well...

1496
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,250
I'm doing a drama called
"Cleaning Up" on JTBC.

1497
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,810
The last episode will air next week.
Please show your support.

1498
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,840
And please watch "Running Man"
on Sunday at 5 p.m. on SBS too.

1499
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,290
It's very fun.

1500
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:40,980
I watch the show every day.

1501
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,060
Thank you.

1502
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,630
And I'm not dating Se Chan.
Don't misunderstand.

1503
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,920
We're joking to make it funny,
but many people are mistaken.

1504
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,290
There's nothing going on
between Ji Hyo and Jong Kook either.

1505
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,040
You guys know it, right?

1506
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,440
What are you doing?

1507
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,730
I should speak for them.

1508
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,900
I wanted to say it
in front of people.

1509
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,480
But why is he not coming out?
Did he leave without me?

1510
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:06,210
Jae Suk is still searching.
It might not be there.

1511
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,020
(At that moment)

1512
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,380
(Jae Suk
holding Suk Jin's name tag?)

1513
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,230
It's inside?

1514
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,690
For real?

1515
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:20,690
(He found it?)

1516
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,460
(Jae Suk who has been searching
for a long time)

1517
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,230
(He finally found
Suk Jin's name tag.)

1518
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,060
- Yes.
- I'm out?

1519
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,110
- Suk Jin is eliminated.
- Gosh.

1520
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:33,540
- Jae Suk found your name tag.
- Oh my, he found it.

1521
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,540
So you lose 100 points.

1522
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,810
- Gosh, I knew he would find it.
- From now on...

1523
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,770
I'm mad.

1524
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,940
Jae Suk, say hi here.

1525
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,380
(Captain Yoo has returned
with confidence.)

1526
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,610
(Screaming)

1527
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,020
I did it thanks to you guys.

1528
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,420
(I did it thanks to you guys.)

1529
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,150
- Jae Suk.
- Thanks to you guys.

1530
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,630
(Thank you.)

1531
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,420
How did you find it?

1532
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,590
- What do you mean how?
- How did you know it was here?

1533
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,900
So Min, come here for now.
Thank you.

1534
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,230
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1535
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:02,540
Work hard.

1536
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,810
Hearing "Work hard"
makes my heart...

1537
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:06,810
(Hearing "Work hard"
makes my heart...)

1538
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,000
Don't work too hard.

1539
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,900
Don't work too hard.
You can work a little bit less.

1540
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,440
Thank you.

1541
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,610
(He coolly leaves
after throwing a dad joke.)

1542
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,580
We must catch Haha.

1543
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,540
Why don't we make Se Chan join us?

1544
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,590
Come here quickly for now.

1545
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,960
- And there's one more thing.
- Okay.

1546
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,520
While...

1547
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:30,590
you were filming Tour of Seoul,
many things happened.

1548
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,420
- Already? Okay.
- Yes. So...

1549
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,590
So Min was eliminated.

1550
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:34,900
- Already?
- Yes.

1551
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:36,310
So was Suk Jin.

1552
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,860
Already?

1553
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,440
Jong Kook was eliminated.

1554
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,730
Already?

1555
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,940
I should've not done
that useless thing.

1556
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:46,670
I spent most of the time hiding it.

1557
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,540
Hello.

1558
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,750
(He met the narrow-mouthed toad
driver again.)

1559
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,150
I had a good time thanks to you.

1560
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,310
Will I appear in the show this week?

1561
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,460
(Will I appear in the show
this week?)

1562
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,420
I came to Sky Park for no reason.

1563
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,420
(He was filming Tour of Seoul alone,
while many things were happening.)

1564
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,150
I should've not filmed
"Yang Se Chan's Tour of Seoul".

1565
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,170
(It's likely to be edited out.)

1566
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,920
- Sir.
- Yes.

1567
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,170
You might not see this scene
in the show.

1568
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,170
Yes.

1569
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,770
Don't watch this week's episode.
Don't stay tuned either.

1570
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,580
I think it'd be right to show
how I do it next time.

1571
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,080
As expected, I don't see
a big picture by myself.

1572
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,380
(Yang Se Chan's Tour of Seoul.
The end)

1573
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,750
Oh, my.

1574
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,750
(I should call So Min.)

1575
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,340
I should call So Min.

1576
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,920
(I should call So Min.)

1577
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:28,360
(He's calling So Min
to understand the situation.)

1578
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,330
I'm busy. Just hang up.

1579
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,900
- I'll hang up. I'm busy.
- Okay.

1580
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,730
(Beeping)

1581
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,420
I feel sad today somehow.

1582
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,730
And I'm a little lonely.
Everyone is not picking up.

1583
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,730
(And I'm a little lonely.
Everyone is not picking up.)

1584
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,540
Do you know why it is more tiring?

1585
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,810
The interviews didn't go well.
It made it even harder.

1586
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:47,810
(The interviews with people
are ruined on top of that.)

1587
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:50,900
What did I say? Did I say
they should enjoy Seoul?

1588
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,750
Why did you do it, Se Chan?
It's been 17 years in the industry.

1589
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,650
And you asked a useless question.

1590
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,790
It's because I didn't learn.

1591
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,810
If you lose the file,
send me one so that I can keep it.

1592
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:01,860
(If you lose the file,
send me one so that I can keep it.)

1593
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,520
Tour of Seoul.

1594
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,730
And the one that was edited out.

1595
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,690
I should post it
on my YouTube channel.

1596
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:08,690
(I should post it
on my YouTube channel.)

1597
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,920
I should earn some money
even if it's a little.

1598
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,360
The first place might appear
in the show more.

1599
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,630
That's the only way.
I should become first.

1600
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:18,630
(Se Chan wants to be 1st
to have enough footage to be aired.)

1601
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,710
- I should find Jae Suk's.
- The head.

1602
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,540
- I should find the head's.
- Yes.

1603
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,810
Then I should find Jae Suk's.

1604
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,110
(Ji Hyo is also having an eye
for Jae Suk at that moment.)

1605
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,440
Now...

1606
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,440
(Jae Suk became everyone's target.)

1607
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,840
I should be careful.

1608
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,960
Both would go for mine first.

1609
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,560
- I'll be their target.
- Yes.

1610
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,150
If they make you join, the others
behind you will also join.

1611
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:40,560
- I know.
- That's why I'm in danger.

1612
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,020
First, So Min.

1613
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:44,330
- We should go to the game spot.
- Okay.

1614
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,460
We should find out.
Come here quickly.

1615
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,460
(They arrived at the mission spot.)

1616
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,460
Hello.

1617
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,460
Oh, my goodness. Seok Sam.

1618
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,000
(They found Seok Sam
who was waiting.)

1619
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,130
The tail.

1620
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,340
How did you find it?

1621
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:58,080
What do you mean how?
Everyone is searching like that.

1622
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,440
- And you're younger than So Min.
- Yes.

1623
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,150
- What did you say?
- I'm younger than So Min?

1624
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,150
She's younger than me.

1625
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,250
But there's a hierarchy here.

1626
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,980
- I'm younger than her?
- Yes. You joined me.

1627
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,480
Welcome, the second tail.
Okay. Bring me the vest.

1628
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,480
- Just wear it.
- Okay.

1629
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,980
I walked around with Jae Suk.

1630
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,130
- His feet are as fast as his mouth.
- Can you help me?

1631
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,520
Put it down for me.

1632
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,630
- Gosh.
- Say "Please".

1633
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,170
- Tail.
- Gosh.

1634
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:19,440
The daughter-in-law and
the father-in-law...

1635
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,440
met after a long time.

1636
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,790
My goodness.
Just thinking about it...

1637
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:22,940
What's the mission?

1638
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:25,460
- Okay.
- Go to the center.

1639
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:26,980
- Shy Suk Jin.
- Shy Suk Jin.

1640
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,040
(Jung Ji Yoon, the floor director)

1641
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,750
- Oh, my.
- Hello.

1642
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,340
She's a shy fan.

1643
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,250
That's right. Shy Suk Jin.

1644
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,980
- How have you been?
- Hi.

1645
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,040
- Hello.
- Gosh.

1646
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,750
- What?
- It's three minutes from now on.

1647
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,750
- Ji Eun.
- I'm Ji Yoon.

1648
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,960
Ji Yoon. Oh, right.
You're Lee Ji Yoon.

1649
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,590
- I'm Jung Ji Yoon.
- Jung Ji Yoon.

1650
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,190
Hey, do it properly.

1651
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,520
Jung Ji Yoon.

1652
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,130
You're 24 or something, right?

1653
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,630
- I'm 27.
- You're 27.

1654
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,840
- I don't...
- They asked me...

1655
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,340
about hometown and eyesight earlier.

1656
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,840
Where are you from?

1657
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,810
- Tongyeong.
- Tongyeong.

1658
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:01,210
How's your eyesight?

1659
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:04,610
It's 0.2, 0.3.

1660
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:05,750
- Are you...
- They might...

1661
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,250
- ask this.
- living alone?

1662
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:10,380
- You're living alone.
- I gave her a gift. Ask what it is.

1663
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,250
- About the gift I gave to her.
- About a year and a half.

1664
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,460
- What did Suk Jin get her?
- The gift I got for her.

1665
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,650
They might ask it.

1666
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,360
What did Suk Jin give to you?

1667
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,330
Don't ask her. He's trying to make
her say a nice story about him.

1668
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:20,360
No. It's because they might ask
about it.

1669
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,590
He's trying to make her
say a nice story about him.

1670
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,060
- They might ask about it.
- He got a gift for you, right?

1671
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,960
- Yes. A cushion for my back.
- Right?

1672
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,360
A cushion for your back.
Have you been using it?

1673
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,170
- Yes.
- Do you have...

1674
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,340
a different wallpaper
on your laptop?

1675
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,340
- It's Suk Jin.
- You still got it.

1676
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:35,170
Yes. Ask her about the color
of the cushion. It's green.

1677
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,480
- Is the cushion green?
- Yes.

1678
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,440
- And...
- Her ideal type.

1679
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,610
- What's your ideal type? Yes.
- My ideal type?

1680
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,750
(Ideal type)

1681
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,150
A handsome type.

1682
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,540
(A handsome type)

1683
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,250
- And she likes Suk Jin?
- It has nothing to do...

1684
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,480
with her ideal type.

1685
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,520
- They're different.
- She said it's a handsome type.

1686
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,360
- A handsome type.
- A handsome type. Okay.

1687
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,020
Then...

1688
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,420
- Your blood type.
- It's A.

1689
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,730
- A.
- Ask her about her MBTI type.

1690
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,330
- What's your MBTI type?
- It's ENFP.

1691
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,440
ENFP.

1692
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,440
You should memorize them all.

1693
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,310
ENFP. Can you drink...

1694
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,040
- a lot?
- How much she can drink.

1695
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,610
I like drinking,
but I can't drink much.

1696
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,840
A half bottle of soju?

1697
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,210
- Yes.
- A half bottle of soju.

1698
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,340
When is your birthday?

59:57,769 --> 01:00:00,869
- September 27.
- Time is up.

1699
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,150
- You guys can't tell him.
- You can't.

1700
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:16,840
- But we're his tails. We're one.
- Pardon?

1701
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,810
- We're the tails.
- You helped him with questions.

1702
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:20,880
- We're attached to his body.
- We're tails.

1703
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,980
- It's...
- Only the head can answer.

1704
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,630
We're tails though.

1705
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,360
Number 2 and 3. Stay over there.

1706
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,590
Keep Suk Jin on your side.

1707
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,920
You should get it right.

1708
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,190
- Get it right.
- No matter what.

1709
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,730
The first question.

1710
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,690
- Don't give him a hint.
- Okay.

1711
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,860
How old is the staff member
in front of you?

1712
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,340
- I know.
- Earlier.

1713
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,710
- I know.
- You asked her.

1714
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:45,840
(How old is the staff member?)

1715
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,940
She's 27.

1716
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,980
(Twenty-seven!)

1717
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,650
- That's correct.
- I'm 27.

1718
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,840
- Yes.
- Hey.

1719
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,750
Hey, we got what we had expected.

1720
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,960
- Okay.
- The second question.

1721
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,380
What does the staff member
in front of you do...

1722
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:57,960
when she's drunk?

1723
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,380
- He didn't ask.
- We don't know.

1724
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,630
She might not do anything specific
when she's drunk.

1725
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,400
We can discuss, right?

1726
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,230
- No, you can't.
- But...

1727
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:06,590
she only drinks a half bottle
of soju. She won't get drunk.

1728
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:09,060
- Think about the get-together.
- Ji Yoon.

1729
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:10,460
- Usually,
- Usually,

1730
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,810
- those who can't drink much...
- those who can't drink much...

1731
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:15,230
- like me just sleep.
- That's it. I agree.

1732
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:16,380
- Does she cry?
- What?

1733
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,000
- Don't...
- Don't ask her.

1734
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,210
Am I not even allowed to think?

1735
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,840
- I can think.
- Usually,

1736
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,840
- those who can't drink much sleep.
- Sit down, little one.

1737
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,650
Okay. Master.

1738
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,460
- Get him some jjondeugi.
- Sit.

1739
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,860
My goodness.

1740
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:33,150
Those who can't drink much
just sleep.

1741
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,420
Does she dance?

1742
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,150
- It can't be.
- She wouldn't dance.

1743
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,500
Do you feel excited?

1744
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,060
- Yangsebastien.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

1745
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,090
- Did you get caught?
- You came.

1746
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:42,590
No. I hid it in Mount Maebong
and just came back.

1747
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:44,340
Really? You went to Mount Maebong?

1748
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,840
- I almost died.
- You're lying again.

1749
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,610
It's true.

1750
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,130
- Why are you such a liar?
- It's real.

1751
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,610
- I went to Mount Maebong.
- Come here.

1752
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,170
- Sit.
- You didn't sweat enough...

1753
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,520
for someone
who went to Mount Maebong.

1754
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,540
You didn't sweat enough.

1755
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,020
Don't say nonsense.

1756
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,810
So what does she do
when she's drunk?

1757
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:02,810
In 1, 2, 3.

1758
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,630
She eats.

1759
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,060
- She eats?
- It's not.

1760
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,420
- It's sleeping.
- What is it?

1761
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,900
I repeat what I said.

1762
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,190
- This...
- She gets talkative.

1763
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,170
You should've said
"She gets talkative."

1764
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,440
- After drinking a half bottle only?
- Hey.

1765
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,540
Ji Yoon.

1766
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,340
- She gets talkative.
- I...

1767
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,610
can't drink much either, but...

1768
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,900
- The youngest. Sit down.
- I mean you can make a deal.

1769
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:23,900
- If you say, "She gets talkative",
- No, little one.

1770
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,900
you can negotiate with the staff.

1771
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,250
I'll give you the third question.

1772
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,080
This is driving me crazy. We'll be
in trouble if I don't get it right.

1773
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,980
If you get it right,
I'll give you a hint.

1774
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,810
- Okay.
- Or try again ten minutes later.

1775
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:32,980
This is driving me crazy.

1776
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,460
What's her MBTI type?

1777
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,560
You remember it, right?

1778
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,420
(What's her MBTI type?)

1779
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,150
Jae Suk, I said
it's the same type as mine.

1780
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:42,420
It's E.

1781
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,000
Come on.

1782
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,290
- ENF...
- Don't give him a hint.

1783
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:49,090
Don't give him a hint.

1784
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,110
(Pressuring him with her eyes)

1785
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:51,730
What's this? Hurry up.

1786
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,810
I want to try.

1787
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,000
- ENFP.
- At least...

1788
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,500
Hey.

1789
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,250
Why?

1790
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,440
It's...

1791
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,840
It's ENF...

1792
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,920
- Guys.
- It's ENFP.

1793
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,340
If you spit it, it's over.

1794
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,110
My answer is...

1795
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,730
- ENFP.
- The answer.

1796
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:12,380
- It's correct.
- Okay!

1797
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,650
It's correct.

1798
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:15,830
Because I'm ESFP.

1799
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:20,190
You can get the address or a photo
of the name tag of your choice.

1800
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,400
Get Haha.

1801
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,610
- That's right.
- Haha's name tag must be near here.

1802
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:26,110
- Shall I get him instead?
- I think Jong Kook got caught.

1803
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:27,380
Please hurry up and get me.

1804
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:29,770
What I did earlier won't get aired.

1805
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,480
What I did earlier won't get aired,

1806
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:33,940
so please hurry up and get me.

1807
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:36,650
Please save me
so that I can get some screen time.

1808
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:37,790
If you catch Haha,

1809
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:39,210
- Jong Kook will come as a tail.
- Yes.

1810
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:41,590
(But the tails think
he should get Team Haha.)

1811
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,790
Pick Haha...

1812
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:44,790
and get the photo.

1813
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,750
I know in which building
his name tag is hidden.

1814
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,000
Really?

1815
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:50,730
(Suk Jin ran into Haha
at the SBS Prism Tower.)

1816
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:52,000
I am 100 percent sure
it's the Prism Tower.

1817
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:53,440
Excuse me. Haha, please.

1818
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:54,790
- Haha.
- Yes.

1819
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:57,040
- Ask for a photo.
- The address or a photo?

1820
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,610
- A photo, please.
- A photo.

1821
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:00,110
- Jae Suk.
- You won't be able to find it...

1822
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:01,170
- from a photo.
- It's the Prism Tower.

1823
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,230
Find my name tag.

1824
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,440
- Jae Suk.
- Hold on.

1825
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,540
But he might end up winning.

1826
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,880
- Ji Hyo or Se Chan.
- All right.

1827
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,810
- Then let's get him.
- That might happen in the end.

1828
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:10,190
Get me.
It will be meaningless to wait.

1829
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:11,520
- You need to get me now.
- This is driving me crazy.

1830
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,290
- How did you gain so much weight?
- What?

1831
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,710
- How did you gain so much weight?
- What?

1832
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,360
- You became chubby.
- That came out of nowhere.

1833
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,650
Why are you hurting his feelings?

1834
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,790
- Seriously.
- You became chubby.

1835
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,650
I lost weight since the opening
because I sweated.

1836
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,090
- Look at his belly.
- How did you gain so much weight?

1837
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,290
You gained so much weight.

1838
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,500
- What happened in a week?
- I was so surprised.

1839
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,460
Yesterday, I had
two servings of galbitang.

1840
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,560
Jae Suk, here is a photo.

1841
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,060
- A photo. Where is it?
- Here you go.

1842
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,060
I am 100 percent sure
it's the Prism Tower.

1843
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,250
- I think he is right.
- It's the broadcasting station.

1844
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,330
It's the broadcasting station.

1845
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,330
(The location of Haha's name tag)

1846
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,370
It's the broadcasting station.
It's the Prism Tower.

1847
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,040
- These are towels.
- Yes.

1848
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,270
- Don't look at other photos.
- I am sorry.

1849
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:49,540
- Towels.
- It's the Prism Tower.

1850
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,730
- It's the Prism Tower. Let's go.
- Let me see the details.

1851
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:53,580
Wait for me. Let's take a break.

1852
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:56,180
We don't have time
to take a break. Hurry up.

1853
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,410
So Min, hurry up.

1854
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:58,770
- Aren't you going to film me?
- So Min.

1855
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,020
- Aren't you going to film me?
- So Min, hurry up.

1856
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,450
Suk Jin, hurry up.

1857
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:03,850
- So Min.
- Excuse me.

1858
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:05,680
- I am going.
- Talk about me from time to time.

1859
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,850
Okay. I will do that.

1860
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,960
Wonder out loud,
"Where could Se Chan's name tag be?

1861
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,620
I am sorry. I am filming today.

1862
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,290
- They are here.
- My goodness.

1863
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:14,870
- Hurry up.
- Excuse me.

1864
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,140
(Haha and Jong Kook learn
that Jae Suk obtained a hint.)

1865
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,270
Did you find it?

1866
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:20,910
- He is running.
- Yes.

1867
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:23,430
(Nervous)

1868
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:25,000
Where did he go?

1869
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:26,680
Let's take a taxi.

1870
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,100
Why is he running?

1871
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,120
It's too far. Let's take a taxi.

1872
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,770
Jae Suk,
a tail wants to take a taxi.

1873
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,410
- What?
- A tail wants...

1874
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:35,910
- to take a taxi.
- Stop speaking nonsense. Hurry up.

1875
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:37,210
- Let's go.
- He wants to do that.

1876
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,810
Hurry up.

1877
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,680
Why are we walking?

1878
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:42,680
It's hot.

1879
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,850
(Haha chases after them
in order to protect his name tag.)

1880
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,160
Jong Kook, let's hurry up
and stop them.

1881
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,770
- I need to move my name tag.
- Hey.

1882
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,700
Just go with the flow,

1883
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,040
- Haha.
- Please cooperate a bit more.

1884
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,810
I really want to win today.

1885
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:55,430
Hurry up.

1886
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,480
Is the prop container...

1887
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:59,140
in the Prism Tower?

1888
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:01,710
It might be at a different location.

1889
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:04,020
Is it the sixth floor?

1890
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:05,140
(Jae Suk arrives
at the 1st-floor lobby.)

1891
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:08,410
I am sorry,
but please pick up the speed.

1892
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,460
- Come on.
- Please help me this once.

1893
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:13,120
This is a hassle. I am exhausted.

1894
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:14,350
Please.

1895
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:16,500
This is where I saw Haha earlier.

1896
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,230
Perhaps he moved it
to a different location.

1897
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:20,330
- He didn't have time to do that.
- He didn't have time.

1898
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:21,890
It's a hassle to move it.

1899
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,600
- Where are they?
- We need to get them.

1900
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,040
- We can take off our masks here.
- Yes.

1901
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,910
(Team Jae Suk arrives
on the 15th floor.)

1902
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:30,330
- Ji Hyo.
- There is Ji Hyo.

1903
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,450
(They find Ji Hyo
who was on the same floor!)

1904
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:36,180
(What is Ji Hyo doing here?)

1905
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,680
- She must have hidden it here.
- Ji Hyo.

1906
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:40,520
(30 minutes ago)

1907
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:44,790
(Ji Hyo succeeded in the mission
and obtained a hint.)

1908
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:48,060
(The address for Haha's name tag:
SBS Prism Tower, 15th floor)

1909
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,730
Is that all I get?

1910
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:51,000
(Thus, she obtained a hint
on Haha's name tag.)

1911
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,160
(Ji Hyo was searching
the 15th floor...)

1912
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,230
(when she ran into Team Jae Suk!)

1913
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:56,600
(Ji Hyo runs at full speed
to find Haha's name tag.)

1914
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,960
- She must have hidden it here.
- Ji Hyo.

1915
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,430
- Ji Hyo.
- Where did you hide it?

1916
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,600
- Ji Hyo, where are you going?
- Ji Hyo.

1917
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,370
Hurry up and get in.

1918
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:07,250
(Team Haha
takes the elevator as well.)

1919
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,450
Hurry up. Run. We don't have time.

1920
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,640
- Ji Hyo, where are you going?
- Ji Hyo.

1921
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:13,540
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1922
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:16,080
Se Chan obtained
a hint on your name tag.

1923
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,350
- This is bad.
- What are you going to do?

1924
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:21,290
- Just hold on to them.
- All right.

1925
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:23,120
(Haha chases after the team
in order to protect his name tag!)

1926
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:24,600
- It's 7th floor.
- It's 7th floor, Haha.

1927
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,850
(He is in a hurry.)

1928
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:28,160
You know that it's here, right?

1929
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,830
It's eighth floor.

1930
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,640
Oh, no.

1931
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,160
You know that it's here, right?

1932
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:36,410
I came to find it.

1933
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:37,680
You don't know the details, do you?

1934
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,600
(They found the prop box
in the photo!)

1935
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:41,770
It will be a hassle.

1936
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,680
(Haha hid the name tag
under the towels.)

1937
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,310
For goodness' sake.

1938
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:46,810
(Haha is close to their floor.)

1939
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,080
You don't know the details, do you?

1940
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,180
(Who will get the name tag first?)

1941
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:52,290
- You saw a photo, right?
- Where is it?

1942
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:54,660
- Right, Ji Hyo?
- All right. We found it.

1943
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,000
(They found Haha's name tag.)

1944
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,250
Did you find it?

1945
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,600
I did it. You should give me
some points.

1946
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:02,600
Haha and Jong Kook are out.

1947
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,960
- You found it.
- Now, Se Chan.

1948
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,460
Jae Suk...

1949
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,230
found your name tag, so you are out.

1950
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,600
All right.

1951
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,870
(He suddenly went from a captain
to a tail.)

1952
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:14,850
Let's just go down to the lobby,
Haha.

1953
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:15,950
(Kim Tail is relaxed
because it doesn't concern him.)

1954
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:18,520
You will feel miserable
if you meet him up there.

1955
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:19,950
(Sighing)

1956
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:21,080
You know what I mean, right?

1957
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,160
I see that Jae Suk is sharp.

1958
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,080
He is sharp.

1959
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,980
(Haha becomes Jae Suk's tail
with the relaxed Kim Tail.)

1960
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:29,390
It's over. We will have
everyone behind our backs.

1961
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,290
- Jong Kook will be added too.
- I know.

1962
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:34,090
Now, Ji Hyo, Se Chan,
and Jae Suk remain.

1963
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:36,060
- Hold on.
- It will be over if you get them.

1964
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:37,840
Myung Jae, let's go.

1965
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:39,670
Let's hurry up and go.

1966
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,910
Let's go.

1967
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,130
Where is Se Chan?

1968
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,170
- Should I do the mission?
- Seriously.

1969
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:47,670
Did you see
where Se Chan hid his name tag?

1970
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:49,770
Se Chan said it's at Mount Maebong.

1971
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:52,050
- It's a lie. That can't be it.
- It's a lie.

1972
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:54,880
- He is bound to come near here.
- You got Haha, right?

1973
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,380
I should ask Haha
because he is the newest addition.

1974
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,660
He might have gotten a hint.

1975
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,130
- Hello.
- We are a team now,

1976
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:03,260
so don't speak nonsense.
Where is Se Chan's name tag?

1977
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:05,160
Where is Se Chan's name tag?

1978
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,890
- Did you find my name tag?
- Yes, I did.

1979
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,130
Where is Se Chan's name tag?

1980
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,840
Congratulations.

1981
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,000
Jong Kook.

1982
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:14,430
Congratulations.

1983
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,580
- He is so simple-minded.
- All right.

1984
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,380
How could you hide it
inside the Running Man office?

1985
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,300
- I found it.
- Jong Kook has no desire to win.

1986
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,310
How could you hide it
inside the Running Man office?

1987
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,550
- Jong Kook has no desire to win.
- Hey.

1988
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,680
Where is Se Chan?

1989
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,090
Se Chan is over there.

1990
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:29,840
Did he obtain a hint?

1991
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,010
It's over.

1992
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:33,160
- Se Chan didn't obtain a hint.
- He is the captain.

1993
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,130
- Jae Suk, decide on the ranks.
- Jae Suk,

1994
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,890
put them behind me.
I found the name tag.

1995
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:40,200
- Punks, change into this pink vest.
- All right.

1996
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,870
- All right.
- I guess you don't need to change.

1997
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:43,090
- Just keep wearing a yellow vest.
- After So Min comes...

1998
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:44,670
- Jong Kook.
- Okay.

1999
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:45,890
- Then comes Haha.
- Hey!

2000
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,100
Okay.

2001
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:49,730
- You are the last one.
- Why am I the last one?

2002
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,730
- This isn't about age.
- But I became a tail...

2003
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:53,040
You are the last one.

2004
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,470
Thank you.

2005
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,620
- He doesn't disappoint.
- This is driving me crazy.

2006
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:57,920
Here is the important thing.

2007
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,580
Se Chan obtained a hint.

2008
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:00,810
He is on his way
to find my name tag.

2009
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:02,250
- Your name tag?
- Yes.

2010
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,260
Okay.

2011
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:05,090
- So...
- I will get him.

2012
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:06,120
- Really?
- Yes.

2013
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,630
- Call Se Chan.
- Jong Kook.

2014
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,290
- Please find Se Chan...
- Se Chan.

2015
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,800
- and hold on to him.
- Okay.

2016
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,520
Things will get complicated
if Se Chan becomes the captain.

2017
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,520
- That's right.
- I am currently the second tail.

2018
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,870
It's better to stay in this team.

2019
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:17,930
What is that?

2020
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,370
Sir, how long will it take?

2021
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,840
- We are 1.5km away.
- Okay.

2022
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,380
Ji Hyo.

2023
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,410
Where are you? I will go to you.

2024
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:30,170
It will end if we get Jae Suk.

2025
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,950
- Will it end if we get Jae Suk?
- Yes.

2026
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,420
We need to get Jae Suk.

2027
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,590
Jae Suk has everyone.

2028
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,810
How about you? Who are you with?

2029
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:39,010
I am alone.

2030
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:41,160
You and I should team up...

2031
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,960
and find Jae Suk's name tag.

2032
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:44,830
Okay.

2033
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:46,260
Come to the Prism Tower.

2034
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:48,130
- Okay.
- All right.

2035
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:49,370
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo
form an alliance.)

2036
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,000
Where will we find Se Chan?

2037
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,700
Seriously.

2038
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:55,100
- We have no idea where Se Chan is.
- Seriously.

2039
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,770
Where is Se Chan?

2040
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:58,930
Se Chan's name tag isn't
in a mountain.

2041
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:00,800
He will go to the location
of your name tag.

2042
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,420
We should go there and get Se Chan.

2043
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,620
- The elevator is here.
- Let's go and get Se Chan.

2044
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,380
- Hello.
- We don't need to film here.

2045
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,980
- Sorry.
- All of us can get in.

2046
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,480
Not all of us can get in.

2047
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,010
- We will go down first.
- No.

2048
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,220
Catch the next elevator.

2049
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,380
- Don't be like that to my team.
- There are no teams.

2050
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,000
We are on the same team.

2051
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:20,170
Why would you divide people up?

2052
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:22,260
- Seriously.
- I got caught because of them.

2053
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,300
(The elevator keeps stopping.)

2054
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:26,230
(Jae Suk's tails
talk among themselves.)

2055
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:27,410
The camera isn't running.

2056
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:28,540
Yes, it is.

2057
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,210
Really? Is it running?

2058
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:32,130
Hello.

2059
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:33,910
We are stopping on every floor.

2060
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:36,770
I see. Did you open the door?

2061
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:38,510
It might have been better
to use the staircase.

2062
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:40,250
- We are getting off.
- We are sorry.

2063
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,550
- We are sorry.
- We are sorry.

2064
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,980
You should get off first.

2065
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,810
- That's right.
- They need to get off.

2066
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,350
- We are sorry.
- We are sorry.

2067
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,880
(The shoot gets halted
while they are in the elevator.)

2068
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,800
- Okay.
- Hurry up and get in.

2069
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,020
Get in. Okay.

2070
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:55,700
You just need to open the door
on the first floor.

2071
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,500
You just need to open the door
on the first floor.

2072
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:00,930
We will be late if we take a car.

2073
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,710
- And...
- Is it nearby?

2074
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,410
- No. We need to take a car.
- You could do that.

2075
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,430
- You could show the way.
- We will get exhausted if we walk.

2076
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:07,770
It's pretty far.

2077
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,080
He doesn't want to walk.

2078
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,580
She asked someone to open the door
on the first floor and show the way.

2079
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,810
We need to split up,

2080
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:15,550
but if we do that...

2081
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:17,350
- It's okay.
- Let's split up.

2082
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:18,790
- Let's split up.
- Okay.

2083
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:20,050
We can't fit in one car.

2084
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:23,800
- What?
- I think someone is here.

2085
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,020
- Did someone enter?
- She told someone to open the door.

2086
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,830
She authorized a member
to enter the building.

2087
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,200
I think a member entered
the building.

2088
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,500
A member entered the building.

2089
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,930
- Who?
- I think it's Se Chan or Ji Hyo.

2090
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,260
- Why would Se Chan come here?
- Your name tag isn't hidden here.

2091
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:35,730
Se Chan must have hidden
his name tag here.

2092
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,300
- No way.
- Se Chan didn't come here.

2093
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,600
- I hid my name tag near here.
- I hid mine here.

2094
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,140
If you go to another building,
you need permission for filming.

2095
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:47,620
- You can't hide it anywhere else.
- She authorized a member.

2096
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:51,920
He must have hidden it
somewhere else.

2097
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,380
We reached our floor.
It took so long.

2098
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:55,880
Is it the first floor,
not the lobby?

2099
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,890
Gosh.

2100
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:58,850
Someone entered the building.
I am sure of it.

2101
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,170
Hyung In.

2102
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:01,800
What did Hyung In say?

2103
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,730
"You can open the door."
She said that.

2104
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:06,500
- Which member would call her...
- Someone entered the building.

2105
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,760
- at this point?
- You need to use this.

2106
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:11,080
Hyung In, for whom
did you open the door?

2107
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:12,800
Wasn't it Se Chan?

2108
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,080
- Hyung In.
- Ma'am, did Se Chan enter?

2109
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:16,750
Here you go.

2110
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,840
Here you go.

2111
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,010
- She didn't see him.
- Don't turn it in.

2112
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:20,450
- We might enter the building again.
- Hyung In.

2113
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,420
Hyung In.

2114
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,290
Hyung In.

2115
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:26,120
- She didn't see him.
- Don't turn it in.

2116
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,460
(Hold on!)

2117
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,660
I have no idea.

2118
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,700
Can I hide it at a friend's house?

2119
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,390
We will take a break here.

2120
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:35,700
A friend's house?

2121
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,170
That's insane.
What's wrong with you?

2122
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:39,170
I want to send Jong Kook
to that house.

2123
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:40,800
(All the members heard her.)

2124
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,260
I will hide it at a friend's house,
so you should go and look for it.

2125
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:45,880
Hyung In.

2126
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,880
(In that case...)

2127
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,080
Where is your house?

2128
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,220
- It's near here.
- Where?

2129
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:55,120
(Hyung In's house is nearby.)

2130
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:56,480
Whose house?

2131
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,010
- Her house?
- Hold on.

2132
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,180
- Her house?
- Your house?

2133
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,880
She opened the door for someone.

2134
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:02,980
Did she hide it in your house?

2135
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,020
Hyung In's house!

2136
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,330
Hyung In, do you live in
Sangam-dong?

2137
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:07,630
- You said you have a boyfriend...
- Did you open the door...

2138
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:09,260
to your house?

2139
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:11,500
Hyung In's boyfriend
came to her house.

2140
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,930
- I see.
- She opened the door for him.

2141
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:15,410
No. That can't be it.

2142
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:16,730
- Really?
- It makes sense.

2143
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,540
She told someone to open the door.

2144
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,510
The call must be work-related
since she took it during the shoot.

2145
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,340
The call must be work-related.

2146
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,310
Hyung In, come here.
Where is your house?

2147
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:27,680
Hurry up. Se Chan must be there.

2148
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:30,380
Didn't Se Chan go to find
your name tag?

2149
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:31,960
- But she...
- Why would he go there?

2150
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,520
- I get it!
- What?

2151
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,550
- Did he go there to move his?
- Ji Hyo must have gone there...

2152
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:36,720
to move her name tag.

2153
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:38,160
- Really?
- Yes.

2154
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,130
- It has to be Ji Hyo.
- She wants to move hers.

2155
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:42,470
- She wants to move hers.
- Can she do it in three minutes?

2156
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:44,500
You think she will focus on defense.

2157
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,560
That's right.

2158
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,560
It will be over
if her name tag gets found.

2159
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:51,010
- Wouldn't she find yours first?
- Why don't you do a mission?

2160
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,040
- Seriously.
- No.

2161
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:55,080
- Hyung In.
- Where do you live?

2162
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,950
Shouldn't we go to protect
Jae Suk's name tag?

2163
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,880
Let's have a vote.

2164
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,920
Finding Se Chan's name tag versus
protecting Jae Suk's name tag.

2165
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,850
Raise your hand
if you want to protect my name tag.

2166
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:04,960
Of course you should do that.

2167
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,790
Raise your hand if you want to find
Se Chan's name tag. One, two, three.

2168
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,920
- Okay.
- Se Chan's name tag?

2169
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,220
- Come here.
- But...

2170
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,300
you need to do a mission.

2171
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,300
- Let's take a car.
- Let's go to Hyung In's house.

2172
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,170
- But you need to do a mission.
- Let's take a car. Hurry up.

2173
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:15,630
- Hurry up.
- You can take that van.

2174
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:17,670
Hyung In, are we going
to your house?

2175
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:19,430
- Are we going to Hyung In's house?
- Yes.

2176
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:24,800
But this came out of nowhere.
Going to Hyung In's house...

2177
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:27,710
because of what So Min heard
is too outrageous.

2178
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,950
(Se Chan arrived near the location
of Jae Suk's name tag.)

2179
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:32,170
Third floor.

2180
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,550
(Se Chan arrived near the location
of Jae Suk's name tag.)

2181
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:34,550
Hello.

2182
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:39,660
- It's where Ji Hyo's name tag is.
- I think so.

2183
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:43,800
I got goosebumps.
If it weren't for what you heard,

2184
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,850
I would have gone to another place.
When you said it...

2185
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,330
Ji Hyo obtained a photo
for your name tag as well.

2186
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:50,370
This is bad.

2187
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:51,370
(At that moment)

2188
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:53,370
I will give all my tails to Ji Hyo
if I am not careful.

2189
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:54,910
We might become her tails.

2190
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:59,470
I want to see a photo of
Jae Suk's name tag.

2191
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:01,010
A photo? Okay.

2192
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,550
I think I know the location.

2193
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:07,620
(She gets a call from Se Chan!)

2194
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,880
- Ji Hyo.
- Se Chan.

2195
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,880
Where are you?

2196
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,090
I just completed the mission.

2197
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:17,020
If you completed the mission,
can you see a photo...

2198
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,520
for Jae Suk's name tag?

2199
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,330
Okay. Now,

2200
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:22,720
I will go there.

2201
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:28,370
Even with the photo,
it won't be easy to find it.

2202
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:30,430
I hope no one moved it.

2203
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:33,080
Isn't it so strange?

2204
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,080
- Why did Se Chan...
- Sir, would you turn right here?

2205
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,750
- Is it near here?
- Yes.

2206
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:39,720
I will take a quick look.

2207
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,980
Let's hide my name tag
someplace else.

2208
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,550
Will you be able to hide it
in a good location?

2209
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:46,120
I will have three minutes.

2210
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,350
He will go to the place
he hid his name tag.

2211
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:51,050
- I knew it.
- We should go there then.

2212
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:52,630
We should go there then.

2213
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:54,890
- Where did you hide it?
- We will get off here.

2214
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:57,000
- Where?
- Please stay here.

2215
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,500
- Where did you hide it?
- Excuse me.

2216
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,630
(If the information
of your name tag is revealed,)

2217
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:02,730
Hurry up.

2218
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:04,470
(you can move the name tag
in 3 minutes.)

2219
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,250
Three minutes begin now.

2220
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,510
(3 minutes begin now.)

2221
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:13,810
(He can only move
the name tag on foot.)

2222
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:14,920
So Min, stay there.

2223
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,590
Hurry up.

2224
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:19,510
(While Jae Suk moves the name tag,)

2225
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:20,590
Se Chan.

2226
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:21,630
Where is it?

2227
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,220
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo meet
at the back of the building.)

2228
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,200
Okay. Hold on.

2229
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,000
It must be in a box.

2230
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,930
- A box?
- Hurry up and find a box.

2231
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,910
(But Jae Suk is already moving
the name tag.)

2232
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,100
I need to be careful.

2233
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:41,270
(He arrives at a secluded area.)

2234
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:42,340
This is too...

2235
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,620
(He hides the name tag
inside the bushes.)

2236
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,750
We don't have much time.

2237
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:48,840
So Min.

2238
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,340
Let's go.

2239
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,420
We need to make sure
we don't catch anyone's eyes.

2240
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,680
All done.

2241
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:57,420
All done.

2242
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,420
Let's take out Ji Hyo and Se Chan.

2243
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,670
(They head back
to Hyung In's house!)

2244
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:03,560
How did she hide it
at a producer's house?

2245
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,060
- Seriously.
- Isn't it too much?

2246
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:09,870
Hyung In has so much for the show.

2247
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,040
She even provided her own house.

2248
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:13,540
Are we headed to Hyung In's house?

2249
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,470
This is ridiculous.

2250
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:16,600
What's the address?

2251
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,840
It's...

2252
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,620
Hey, let's switch sides.

2253
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:22,420
- Switch sides?
- Yes.

2254
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,880
You could do that if you want.

2255
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,550
Really? Okay.

2256
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:28,460
It's impossible to find.

2257
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:30,800
Suk Jin.

2258
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,330
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

2259
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:34,220
Why don't we make a deal?

2260
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,560
Se Chan!

2261
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,500
- We...
- Se Chan!

2262
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,930
Jong Kook, Haha, and I want
to switch to your side.

2263
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:42,670
But you need to make us
high-ranking tails.

2264
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:45,880
If we become your tails,
you will be the captain.

2265
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,170
Of course. I will make you guys
the high-ranking tails.

2266
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:50,100
- Make sure you do that.
- Okay.

2267
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,340
As for Jae Suk's name tag...
Do you need the address?

2268
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:53,790
I got the address.

2269
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:56,880
I think Jae Suk moved it.

2270
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,220
- Did he move it?
- He didn't move it.

2271
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,460
- He moved it.
- Really?

2272
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:01,680
I think he moved it.

2273
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,760
The address is right,
but he moved it to a nearby place.

2274
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,260
You can't go far in three minutes.

2275
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:07,130
- It's nearby.
- It must be at a nearby place.

2276
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:10,730
Ask people if they have seen
Jae Suk.

2277
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,540
- Okay.
- Go there.

2278
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:14,260
Where did you hide your name tag?

2279
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:16,210
It's not even a good hint.

2280
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:18,730
- Hello?
- Yes?

2281
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:19,800
It isn't here.

2282
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,970
Jae Suk hid it nearby.

2283
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,550
(Find the name tag Jae Suk hid.)

2284
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:25,470
We are here.

2285
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:26,510
(Jae Suk and So Min arrive
at Hyung In's house.)

2286
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:28,620
Thank you.

2287
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:30,920
Shall we go inside?

2288
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:33,260
She got here by car.

2289
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,850
So Hyung In opened this door.

2290
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:36,260
I think Hyung In opened this door.

2291
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,550
This is the place.

2292
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,300
Where is it?

2293
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,200
- And...
- Yes?

2294
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,200
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

2295
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,630
It would be too crowded...

2296
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:45,470
- if the three of you enter as well.
- Shall we keep watch?

2297
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,210
- Yes. Please keep watch.
- Come back soon.

2298
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,760
- Shall we keep watch here?
- Yes.

2299
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:49,800
Okay.

2300
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:53,010
What's here?
I think he has the wrong idea.

2301
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:54,080
(Is Ji Hyo's name tag here?)

2302
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,950
- I think he has the right idea.
- Really?

2303
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:57,920
Hyung In.

2304
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:01,340
It's my first time
going to a producer's house.

2305
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,420
I see.

2306
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:06,680
Seriously. I don't understand.

2307
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:10,180
Ji Hyo or Se Chan
can't come up with such ideas.

2308
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,390
Don't film it.

2309
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:13,330
She is hiding it.

2310
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:14,890
Hold on.

2311
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,970
- Can I enter?
- Yes.

2312
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:19,930
Hyung In, can I enter your house?

2313
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,630
- This is...
- Is the mission that important?

2314
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:23,670
(He becomes hesitant.)

2315
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,580
- This is...
- We shouldn't stand in the hallway.

2316
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:28,640
(He takes a deep breath and enters.)

2317
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:31,420
Is the mission that important?

2318
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:32,750
Hyung In, your house...

2319
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,920
(She reveals her house
in its natural state.)

2320
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,590
Hold on. Please excuse me
since I am here with you.

2321
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:41,880
(He cautiously begins
to look around the house.)

2322
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,960
Hold on.

2323
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,000
Where did she hide it?

2324
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:50,060
Hyung In, can't you look for it?

2325
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:54,870
Hyung In, I can't do this.

2326
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:59,930
Even though you are a producer,
I can't search a woman's house.

2327
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,300
Would you please look for it?

2328
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:04,310
- Can I go upstairs?
- Yes.

2329
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:05,750
I am cautious...

2330
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:07,420
because this is your house.

2331
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,380
Is it in this building?

2332
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:14,050
(Se Chan searches
for Jae Suk's name tag.)

2333
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,660
(He keeps circling
the original location.)

2334
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:21,260
It has to be near here.

2335
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:24,730
Hyung In, can I move this?

2336
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:26,260
- Sure.
- Hold on.

2337
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,340
I should venture out.

2338
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,410
- You haven't seen Jae Suk, right?
- I haven't.

2339
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:31,800
(Se Chan turns
to a different direction.)

2340
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:36,750
(It's the path Jae Suk took
to hide his name tag!)

2341
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,810
(Se Chan follows the path.)

2342
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:42,220
Maybe she opened this.

2343
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:43,620
(Jae Suk's search
isn't going anywhere.)

2344
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:46,920
Did Jae Suk come here? No?

2345
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:50,350
There are only a few places
where you can hide it.

2346
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:51,760
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo versus Jae Suk)

2347
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,590
He must have hidden it near here.

2348
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,260
I am in a hurry.

2349
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:06,010
What?

2350
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:08,950
(He found Ji Hyo's name tag!)

2351
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,170
Can I hide it at someone's house?

2352
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:15,620
Can I hide it at Hyung In's house?

2353
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,720
I texted her. "Hyung In."

2354
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,510
"Can I stop by your place?"

2355
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,680
Okay.

2356
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,420
(She managed to get
the resident's consent.)

2357
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,460
The door is opening.

2358
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:26,460
Follow me.

2359
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:29,260
I should hide my name tag.

2360
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,090
(Ji Hyo hid her name tag
under the sofa.)

2361
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,430
There's no way
they can find my name tag.

2362
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:35,100
(And she believed
no one would find her name tag.)

2363
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,040
(A call from the janitor's office)

2364
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:42,550
(She got a call
regarding the shoot in her place.)

2365
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:45,880
(So Min heard the phone call.)

2366
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,510
(And the chase master
found the name tag.)

2367
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:49,640
My gosh.

2368
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,180
All right. Song Ji Hyo is out.

2369
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,290
(Song Ji Hyo is out.)

2370
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:56,260
I'm really good at this.

2371
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:59,890
Ji Hyo, you're out.

2372
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:01,060
(Ji Hyo, you're out.)

2373
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:03,090
(Ji Hyo became Jae Suk's tail
at the last minute.)

2374
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:05,730
Gosh, I was looking
for his name tag!

2375
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:07,910
(Song Ji Hyo)

2376
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:09,410
Now I need Se Chan's name tag.

2377
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:12,910
I hid mine again,
so I'm at an advantage now.

2378
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:13,910
(Jae Suk moved his name tag,
so he's at an advantage now.)

2379
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,970
I moved my name tag,
so he won't be able to find mine.

2380
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:18,840
- I'll give you.
- On Monday...

2381
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,840
Did you find it? He found it.

2382
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,620
- Did you find it?
- How did you find it?

2383
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:23,510
- So it was there.
- That's impressive.

2384
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,420
- It was really there.
- You're amazing.

2385
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,180
If you didn't hear the phone call,
he wouldn't have found it.

2386
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:30,800
- I could find it thanks to So Min.
- Right.

2387
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,160
She deserves to be number one.

2388
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,170
- When So Min said that...
- She helps you a lot.

2389
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:36,000
- I just realized...
- She's good.

2390
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,800
You tails.

2391
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,470
Hyung In wouldn't have told me.

2392
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:41,210
- I know.
- By the way, our ranks...

2393
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:43,260
I don't think our ranks make sense.

2394
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,670
Aren't we supposed to alter
our pecking orders?

2395
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:45,670
- What?
- It should be changed.

2396
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:47,170
- Do you want me to change?
- I will...

2397
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:48,210
All right then.

2398
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:50,050
- All right.
- What?

2399
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:52,580
- Jae Suk.
- Se Chan found his name tag?

2400
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:55,420
Se Chan found your name tag.

2401
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:56,420
(Se Chan found your name tag.)

2402
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,260
You're just one of us now.

2403
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:01,660
(He found the name tag
in the new place?)

2404
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:02,880
I think...

2405
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,350
- one of the tails did it.
- My gosh.

2406
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:06,700
- I can't believe...
- Someone gave him the address.

2407
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:10,170
No, it wasn't me.
Jae Suk, I'm serious.

2408
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:12,200
- I didn't do it.
- I can't believe this.

2409
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,170
- You're unbelievable.
- You're really...

2410
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:16,510
- Jeon So Min, you are...
- Seriously, I didn't do it.

2411
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,300
You should've kept
your tails under control.

2412
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:20,010
- Was that you?
- Why...

2413
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:22,670
did you tell her
about the new location?

2414
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:24,470
- Who do you think it is?
- Why did you tell her?

2415
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:26,670
We don't even know where you hid it.

2416
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:30,380
(30 minutes ago)

2417
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:35,380
(Jae Suk trusted So Min
and moved his name tag with her.)

2418
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:39,260
(He made a quick decision
and moved his name tag.)

2419
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:43,300
(Jae Suk got only 3 minutes
to move it to somewhere else.)

2420
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,300
So Min, stay there.

2421
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,100
(Jae Suk even took care of So Min
while moving his name tag.)

2422
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,340
Follow him.

2423
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:52,540
Can he really do this
in three minutes?

2424
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,640
Where is he going? Is there
any place where he can hide it?

2425
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:58,510
(While Jae Suk was
moving his name tag,)

2426
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,340
(So Min called someone.)

2427
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:02,380
Where are you?

2428
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:04,880
I'm looking for
Jae Suk's name tag now.

2429
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,460
Where are you?

2430
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,090
Jae Suk just moved his name tag
to another place.

2431
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,380
Where?

2432
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,470
If I tell you that,
will you make me number two?

2433
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:17,090
- Yes, I will.
- Wait. Let me see where I am now.

2434
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:20,540
Hang on. Jae Suk is coming.
I have to go.

2435
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,130
All right. Get in.

2436
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:27,010
(Where exactly am I now?)

2437
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,270
(He hid it in the flower bed.)

2438
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:34,180
(It's in the flower bed
in front of a convenience store.)

2439
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:37,660
- I should go there.
- Here's the recommended route.

2440
01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:39,350
Where's the convenience store?

2441
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:41,590
(Se Chan asked around
to find the convenience store.)

2442
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:42,590
Where?

2443
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:44,090
In there?

2444
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,850
Thank you.

2445
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,390
My gosh.

2446
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:52,670
(When Jae Suk was looking
for Ji Hyo's name tag,)

2447
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:54,470
I found it.

2448
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:56,210
It's here.

2449
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:58,080
(Se Chan found Jae Suk's.)

2450
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,410
Out? What does that mean?

2451
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:03,010
(Yang Se Chan wins.)

2452
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:04,100
Okay.

2453
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:07,340
Ji Hyo is Jae Suk's tail, right?

2454
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,290
Okay. So I'm the winner.

2455
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:12,260
(The duo born in 1986 nailed
the race like that.)

2456
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,980
We don't even know where you hid it.

2457
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:16,460
- You moved it.
- All right.

2458
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:19,000
So the race is over.

2459
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,800
She's the only one
who knows the new place.

2460
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,800
You are unbelievable.

2461
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,420
- I don't care who wins.
- No.

2462
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,670
You are...

2463
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:26,560
(You are...)

2464
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,210
Hang on.

2465
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:29,560
- I knew it.
- I can't believe this.

2466
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,800
- She is the So Min we know.
- It doesn't matter who wins.

2467
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,410
- Jae Suk.
- Let's go.

2468
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:34,910
- You have no choice.
- I know.

2469
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:37,010
- This is how things work.
- It's all for the best.

2470
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,170
- When the camera is on...
- You are...

2471
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:40,170
- So you never change.
- Hey.

2472
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,880
I almost got disappointed.

2473
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,460
- You...
- Seriously, you are...

2474
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:46,920
- Let's go.
- I knew this would happen.

2475
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,720
- I knew it would go like this.
- Sure.

2476
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,630
Isn't that obvious?
You should watch out for her.

2477
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:52,220
- I know.
- This is really...

2478
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,700
So am I the winner?
She just got caught?

2479
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,170
Lucky!

2480
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,130
Yang Se Chan is the winner.

2481
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:00,000
Please look forward
to the next race.

2482
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,540
(The race is not over yet.)

2483
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:06,540
(We never know who will win
before the race is over.)

2484
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:08,170
(The exhausting race)

2485
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:10,140
(The one who survives
until the end...)

2486
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:11,880
(Catch others off their guard.)

2487
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:15,180
(The tails rebel against the head.)

2488
01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:17,980
- You fool.
- What are you doing?

2489
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:18,980
(Why did you do that?)

2490
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:20,680
(The traitors are punished.)

2491
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:22,130
(They give...)

2492
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:23,130
(as good as they get.)

2493
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:24,330
(This is no big deal.)

2494
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,260
(The race that you can't
take lightly continues.)

2495
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:29,370
(And...)

2496
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:30,760
(The members are
in Yeouido this time?)

2497
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:34,040
(They throw the production budget
away for fun.)

2498
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,600
- There's a mountain.
- Who is it?

2499
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,340
(Three men are coming
to Running Man?)

2500
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,710
(They are here to shake
the negotiation table.)

2501
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:41,800
(You're broke, right?)

2502
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,270
(Lee Yi Kyung, Ha Do Kwon,
Joo Woo Jae)

2503
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:44,770
(Those without money...)

2504
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:46,880
(become the prey at the table.)

2505
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:47,980
(Those with money...)

2506
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,590
(lead the negotiations.)

2507
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:51,120
(Race of Groups)
