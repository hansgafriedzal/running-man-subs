1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,130
It's The Running Tag of Tails.

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,400
You will hide your name tags in Sangam-dong.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,800
Please go to Nanjicheon Pond.

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,030
SBS.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,300
This is perfect.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,240
- Hey. - I worked really hard for this.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,740
- It's over. - Hyung In, can I enter your house?

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,150
Se Chan found your name tag.

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,950
- This is... - You're just one of us now.

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,420
My gosh.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,120
- I can't believe... - Someone gave him the address.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,760
No, it wasn't me. Jae Suk, I'm serious.

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,160
- I didn't do it. - I can't believe this.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,210
The race will be over once one of you collects six tails.

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,110
Then we will continue the next race in the SBS building.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,110
- Is it the first race? - Yes.

17
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,280
- Is this for two episodes? - The two members...

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,020
with the highest scores will be the winners and win the prizes.

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,050
Two in the last will be getting a penalty.

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,350
- Two members. - You will get the most points...

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,820
in the first race.

22
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,990
You will move on to the next race with the ranks from the first one.

23
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,530
- Really? - So it's important to get...

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,030
many points and high ranks in this race.

25
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,240
I'll tell you how to get more points in the first race.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,110
- If you find someone's name tag, - I found it thanks to you.

27
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,910
you get 100 points.

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,950
- Yes. - I'm out?

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,280
- Suk Jin is eliminated. - And if your name tag...

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,520
is found by someone else, you lose 100 points.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,350
- Jae Suk found your name tag. - Oh my, he found it.

32
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,990
If you found the name tag of a member who has tails,

33
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,390
you get extra points according to the number of tails.

34
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,630
- Congratulations. - He is so simple-minded.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
- Song Ji Hyo is out. - It's over.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,670
Se Chan, you found Jae Suk's name tag.

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,740
So the race is over.

38
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,710
- Only she knows where he hid it. - Amazing.

39
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,710
No, it wasn't me. Jae Suk, I'm serious.

40
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,710
- You're unbelievable. - You're really...

41
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,150
- Jeon So Min, you are... - Seriously, I didn't do it.

42
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,150
Let's go.

43
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,720
- You have no choice. - I know.

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,050
Seriously, Jeon So Min...

45
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,620
How could you do this? My gosh.

46
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,160
I'm sorry, but you have to hurry.

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,290
We have to go. We don't have time.

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,960
- Hurry up. - What's all this?

49
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,430
Hold this.

50
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,770
I did it. You should give me some points.

51
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,300
"You can open the door." She said that.

52
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,710
Let's hide my name tag someplace else.

53
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,010
Will you be able to hide it in a good location?

54
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,640
I will have three minutes.

55
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,750
I can move around in this car.

56
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,150
- Se Chan. - Hey, So Min.

57
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,620
What?

58
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,220
Where are you?

59
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,790
If I...

60
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,460
tell you that, will you make me number two?

61
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,000
I will give you the highest number. I think Ji Hyo is coming now.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,970
It might be over soon. So I should hurry and...

63
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,640
Jae Suk just moved his name tag.

64
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,110
Where?

65
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,110
If I tell you that, will you make me number two?

66
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,410
- Yes, I will. - Wait. Let me see where I am now.

67
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,910
It's my first time going to a producer's house.

68
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,920
Thank you.

69
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,390
So Min, what's with you?

70
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,390
It's the So Min I know. I almost got disappointed.

71
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,120
I knew this would happen. I knew it would go like this.

72
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,640
- Seriously, I'm...
- Hello.

73
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,510
I was so disappointed.
So Min, you...

74
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,900
So Min is upset as well.

75
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,140
I knew you'd do this.

76
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,740
I see.

77
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,280
I realized it after hiding mine.
"Oh, right. So Min is watching."

78
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,890
So I asked the driver to stay there.

79
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,390
You shouldn't have trusted her.

80
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,760
Why did you trust her?

81
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,280
I didn't trust her.
I was just in a hurry.

82
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,490
- I mean...
- And...

83
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,990
So Min helped me twice.

84
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,990
- She made him number one.
- Right.

85
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,350
And that's not all.

86
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,760
When I was in the elevator,

87
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,000
So Min heard Hyung In
talk on the phone.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
- And I found Haha's name tag.
- It was really hard to find.

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,010
Hyung In was...

90
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,010
- acting a little strange.
- I thought it was ridiculous.

91
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,480
What kind of producer
would let us use her house?

92
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
- That doesn't make sense.
- Hyung In, are you okay with this?

93
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
They must be really close.

94
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,250
I didn't know
I'd go to Hyung In's house.

95
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,580
Me neither.

96
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,380
- Seriously, Hyung In was...
- It was new.

97
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,690
- It was your first time, right?
- It was.

98
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,290
It was my first time
going to a producer's house.

99
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,080
Ji Hyo, why did you go to her place?

100
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,520
I was going to go to Pyeonghwa Park.

101
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,690
Then I came up with a place
where you can't find my name tag.

102
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,100
I was near Hyung In's house,

103
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,490
- so I asked for her passcode.
- That's unbelievable.

104
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,010
She didn't tell me,
so I sent her like 30 text messages.

105
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,510
"Hyung In, please help me."

106
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,240
- And I was there.
- And she got caught.

107
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,570
So I will tell you
the points you've earned.

108
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,180
Se Chan got 650 points.

109
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,270
- Yes!
- That's a lot.

110
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,490
Jae Suk got 450 points.

111
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,180
- My gosh.
- That's not bad.

112
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,260
And Haha and Ji Hyo got zero points.

113
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,520
- What?
- Why?

114
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,290
Suk Jin got minus 20 points.

115
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,600
- Oh, dear.
- Minus?

116
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,990
- Minus 20 points?
- Minus?

117
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,270
So Min got minus 60 points.

118
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,460
Why is it minus?

119
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,160
Jong Kook got minus 100 points.

120
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,660
- Why?
- Why is it minus?

121
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,370
You lose 100 points
when your name tag is found.

122
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,630
Those who didn't find anything
have low points.

123
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,800
- I see.
- I lost mine at the beginning.

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,010
Anyway, you will have the next
mission with your current ranks.

125
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,880
Those with higher ranks are
more likely to win more points.

126
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,440
- Okay.
- So it's continuous.

127
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,990
Se Chan, you are
to decide your ranks.

128
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,910
It's ridiculous
that Se Chan gets to decide.

129
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,730
- Is it my call?
- Is it Se Chan's decision?

130
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,260
- Where's number one's seat?
- The one on the left.

131
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,820
I see. Move over.

132
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,850
Me?

133
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,160
- Move over.
- Sir.

134
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,190
- Hey.
- Hey, I...

135
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,760
How did you gain so much weight?

136
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,190
- Why is he...
- He gained a lot of weight.

137
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,730
What happened to you?

138
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,540
I keep gaining weight these days.

139
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,100
You look like a toad now.

140
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,570
But you look pleasantly plump.

141
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,280
- Pleasantly plump?
- That's not true.

142
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,440
You're the last. Go to the back.

143
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,670
- He's like an anchovy.
- Anchovy?

144
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,590
Actually, So Min was a big help.

145
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,590
I gave him my everything.

146
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,510
- So I have to make her number two.
- Hey.

147
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,010
- My gosh, give it to her.
- I mean,

148
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,380
- So Min... All right.
- Hey.

149
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,980
- I also helped you.
- So Min gave me everything.

150
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,920
I should've taken her phone away.

151
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,260
- Jong Kook.
- You shouldn't trust her like that.

152
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,190
- Her phone... Gosh.
- Why did you trust her?

153
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,360
So Min is number two.

154
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,540
I should've taken her phone away.

155
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,810
- Me.
- You can never trust her.

156
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,760
Se Chan, you can't abandon me.

157
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,570
- I won't abandon you.
- If I don't get picked here...

158
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,380
- How could you...
- I gave you all my tails.

159
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,720
So I enjoyed them. I loved it.

160
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,670
Number three is Jong Kook.

161
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,250
Okay. And Ji Hyo.

162
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,220
You're the last. This is it.

163
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,350
Please take your seat.

164
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,660
I'd rather be number seven
than flatter him.

165
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,190
- This is so upsetting.
- I guess we will draw.

166
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,450
Gosh, this is...

167
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,030
Let's just solve quizzes.

168
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,890
It's like a minefield over there.

169
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,570
We can get more points here.
Is that all right?

170
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,920
I love it.

171
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,630
- Salute.
- Salute.

172
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,310
- I'll give you a mission now.
- Okay.

173
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,100
If you complete the mission,

174
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,700
you will draw three ping-pong balls
for each question.

175
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,700
- Really?
- In the box,

176
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,610
you have 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2,
and 1 balls, respectively.

177
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,060
The one with the highest rank
has the most balls.

178
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,880
- So he's more likely to get picked.
- Right.

179
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,160
And the one with the lowest rank...

180
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,690
has the least chance
of getting picked.

181
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,560
- Oh, dear.
- If three balls have the same name,

182
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,160
the member will get all the points.

183
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,820
- Oh, dear.
- Okay.

184
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,040
Then I will give you a mission.

185
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,860
The mission is called...

186
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,700
Reversed Telepathy.

187
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,910
You will hear a keyword we give you.

188
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,140
And you will write down a word
that's related to the keyword.

189
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,170
Five members or more
should give different answers.

190
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,540
- Different answers?
- I see.

191
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,720
- I know what it is like.
- We can do this.

192
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,320
- We have good teamwork.
- Not the same answers.

193
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,690
Five members or more should
have different answers.

194
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,750
- So...
- I can do this.

195
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,750
You should just give random answers.

196
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,920
If you give different answers,
we will draw three balls.

197
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,250
- I'll write the obvious ones.
- Okay.

198
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,060
- And if you...
- Because you're number one.

199
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,840
fail the mission, Yang Se Chan,

200
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,210
who is currently number one,
will lose 50 points.

201
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,730
If you fail.

202
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,670
- Number one is not good.
- He loses points?

203
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,710
Yes, 50 points.

204
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,170
That's a lot.

205
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,450
- Then we should fail.
- If you succeed,

206
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,020
you might get 90 points
per question.

207
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,080
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

208
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,450
You can also change
your ranks after each question.

209
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,110
I can change the ranks?

210
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,610
You can switch
the ranks of two members.

211
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,420
- I will try my best.
- I'll work hard.

212
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,620
- Try your best.
- Here's the first question.

213
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,700
At least five members
should give different answers.

214
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
- Okay.
- I can do that.

215
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,130
A three-syllable capital city.

216
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,760
- A three-syllable capital city?
- Yes.

217
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,570
You get ten seconds.

218
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,520
A capital city.

219
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,170
- You can't cheat.
- We can give different answers.

220
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,690
This is difficult.

221
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,810
Hang on.

222
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,830
This is mine.

223
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,200
A capital city?

224
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,400
- Don't write it.
- This might not be a capital city.

225
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,980
Three syllables...

226
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,840
- All right. Ten.
- Hang on.

227
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,210
- Wait. I can't think of anything.
- What if I don't write anything?

228
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,050
Then you fail.

229
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,280
- I'm 100 percent sure.
- If we give the same answers...

230
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,580
- Hang on. To get points...
- I'm sure we have the same answers.

231
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,280
Haha, what do you think we wrote?

232
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,930
It's obvious. What we know is...

233
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,570
- Hang on.
- I wrote a difficult one.

234
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,260
- Eight, seven,
- Just write anything.

235
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,500
six, five,

236
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,890
- What did you write?
- four,

237
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,310
- three, two, one. Open.
- I don't think this is a capital.

238
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,960
- It should be a capital city.
- Mine is a capital city.

239
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,770
- It should be a capital city.
- Mine is a capital city.

240
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,840
- Gosh, Tottenham?
- Hey.

241
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,340
- Tottenham? That's ridiculous.
- My goodness.

242
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,420
- What do we do with Tottenham?
- Who wrote Tottenham?

243
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,620
Ji Hyo.

244
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,620
- Take turns and read your answers.
- Is it wrong?

245
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,650
- Bogota, the capital of Columbia.
- Okay.

246
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,360
- Lisbon.
- Manila.

247
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
- This is...
- Manila.

248
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,060
- Tottenham.
- Tottenham is wrong.

249
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,000
- This is...
- Washington.

250
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,820
- Brussels.
- Okay.

251
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,460
- Sidney is wrong, right?
- It's wrong.

252
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,500
But you gave five different answers.

253
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,690
- You can't do this.
- This is...

254
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,090
- You succeeded.
- Okay.

255
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,830
(The ones in the lower ranks
got it right against their wills.)

256
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,310
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo...

257
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,510
- gave wrong answers.
- Suk Jin.

258
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,010
- I tried my best.
- I know.

259
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,640
You two will go higher
in the next round.

260
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,480
You wrote Tottenham?

261
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,440
I couldn't think
of any capital cities.

262
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,550
A three-syllable word.

263
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,780
- So we...
- Did we succeed?

264
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,510
- Yes.
- We should get it wrong.

265
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,120
- But this is...
- You might get points.

266
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,730
If you do a good job,
I will bring you here. Don't worry.

267
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,060
- Really?
- You can come up higher.

268
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,500
- Will you do that?
- Of course.

269
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,230
I have a good reason.

270
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,960
- Isn't it cool that I wrote Bogota?
- Bogota?

271
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,500
- That's so cool.
- The capital of Columbia.

272
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,240
- No one knew it.
- Well done.

273
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,610
- There you go.
- I'm cool.

274
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,260
We will draw three balls.

275
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,630
Please.

276
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,030
(The members in higher ranks
with high probabilities...)

277
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,380
(and the ones in lower ranks
with low probabilities)

278
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,440
Kim Jong Kook, Song Ji Hyo,
and Jeon So Min.

279
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,640
(Kim Jong Kook, Song Ji Hyo,
and Jeon So Min.)

280
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,770
I'm not one of them?

281
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,340
(There are 7 balls
with his name on them.)

282
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,650
I'm not one of them?

283
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,280
- I'm so glad.
- We did it.

284
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,880
Kim Jong Kook, Song Ji Hyo,
and Jeon So Min get 30 points each.

285
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,150
- Thank you.
- So the probability matters.

286
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,190
This is nice.

287
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,890
- Thank you, Se Chan.
- Okay.

288
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,070
- I'll try my best.
- Good.

289
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,760
- My gosh.
- Do we stay here...

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,170
or go up?

291
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,960
You can switch two members.

292
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,900
I have no choice.
Ji Hyo should be number seven.

293
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,530
- I have no choice.
- You can only trade two members.

294
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,340
- Ji Hyo and...
- I worked hard.

295
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,550
You know I gave a different answer.

296
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,920
Hey, I'm the one
who first betrayed him.

297
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,640
You know I was
nothing but loyal to you.

298
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,050
All right.

299
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,340
- Hey.
- Nice.

300
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,420
(Punching)

301
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,210
(A new comedy skit is complete.)

302
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,520
- Comedians...
- Well done.

303
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,190
Hurry. "Well done?"

304
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,950
Well done.

305
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,360
- Hurry.
- First...

306
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,130
- Jae Suk has many points.
- Right.

307
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,300
So...

308
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,070
- I have zero points.
- The ones with lower points...

309
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,440
If you can't decide, just pick me.

310
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,070
All right then.

311
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,070
- Haha and Ji Hyo will switch.
- Thank you.

312
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,270
- But I...
- This is the right thing.

313
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,110
- I don't have many points.
- Suk Jin, you are up next.

314
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,140
If you keep going like this,
I won't cooperate.

315
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,010
- You won't cooperate?
- All right.

316
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,480
- Here's the second keyword.
- Okay. Let's go.

317
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,710
Chinese idioms about animals.

318
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,920
- Cheongomabi.
- Gungyeilhak.

319
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,490
That's good. I was going
to write it, but I changed.

320
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,710
- Pass.
- I changed it.

321
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,630
Tosagupaeng.

322
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,990
Hosiubo.

323
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,000
- Hosiubo?
- Yes.

324
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,570
Obiirak. But someone wrote it.

325
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,130
Hang on. Please take a look at this.

326
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,230
- What?
- What is it?

327
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,800
- Ji Hyo, what's that?
- Look.

328
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,460
- Hey, Tottenham.
- You should read this.

329
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,810
- Tottenham, what did you write?
- Let me see.

330
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,330
- Show us.
- Let me see.

331
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,480
Just show us.

332
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,080
Nyangjungjichuk?

333
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,170
- Jichuk?
- What?

334
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,510
- Nyang?
- Is it a cat?

335
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,210
- A cat?
- Nyang, a cat?

336
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,580
That sounds cute.

337
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,540
And this should be "chu."

338
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,720
- And this is "nang."
- Is it about a cat?

339
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,540
- A cat's punch?
- It means a cat.

340
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,910
- Nyang.
- A cat?

341
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,880
All right. You have 2 same answers
and 1 wrong answer.

342
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,020
- So you failed.
- We failed.

343
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,200
Se Chan loses 50 points.

344
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,050
Will you go like this again?

345
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,560
I'll switch seats.

346
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,760
- I should go up.
- Send me up.

347
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,340
- Jae Suk will come up.
- Okay.

348
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,430
Who will switch with him?

349
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,530
- So Min will go down.
- No. I don't want to.

350
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,840
So Min and Jae Suk
will switch seats.

351
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,400
- If I go down, I'll mess it up.
- How?

352
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,480
I will write
the same answer as yours.

353
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,250
- So Min.
- Just go.

354
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,380
Get lost.

355
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,280
So Min, go down.

356
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,810
- Why are you there?
- You don't belong here.

357
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,720
So Min, this isn't fair.

358
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,990
- Don't be ridiculous.
- We should go against him.

359
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,150
- Captain Yang.
- Yes?

360
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,330
Why would you have someone...

361
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,730
- who talks nonsense sits here?
- I'm sorry.

362
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,960
- I'm so upset.
- All right. Let's begin.

363
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,060
A great man from the Joseon Dynasty.

364
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,700
But not a king.

365
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,800
- What? A great man?
- A great man of the Joseon Dynasty.

366
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,240
- Someone famous?
- Sure.

367
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,630
The Joseon Dynasty...

368
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,350
Exactly...

369
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,300
We should give different answers
for our captain, right?

370
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,770
I have a few options.

371
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,180
- No.
- The Joseon Dynasty?

372
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,310
- Why?
- Hey.

373
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,490
It's Joseon. That's...

374
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,810
- It's...
- You can't tell him that.

375
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,490
But this doesn't make sense.

376
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,650
He wrote Gang Gam Chan again.

377
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,150
No. I made a mistake.

378
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,600
- It's Kang Chan Hee.
- All right.

379
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,760
- Okay.
- All right.

380
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,740
All right. Open.

381
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,100
Which one should I pick?

382
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,370
- Open your answers.
- What?

383
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,710
Suk Jin.

384
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,210
Suk Jin is upset.

385
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,130
- Suk Jin is mad.
- Why?

386
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,530
- What?
- What did he write?

387
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,510
- He's throwing a tantrum.
- A tantrum?

388
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,880
- He wrote Choi Bul Am.
- Excuse me.

389
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,510
- What?
- What are you doing?

390
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,490
- This is what I think.
- He's throwing a tantrum.

391
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,180
- He's a great man in my heart.
- It's all right.

392
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,780
- This is how I feel.
- Two people wrote Jeong Yak Yong.

393
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,960
Who wrote Jeong Yak Yong?

394
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,920
- Jeong Yak Yong?
- Do you know Jeong Yak Yong?

395
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,050
I do.

396
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,420
- Gosh, this is crazy.
- Of course.

397
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,700
- Just keep going like that.
- Hey, you know the answer.

398
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,560
- Now you have two questions left.
- Okay.

399
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,930
The keyword is...

400
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,240
economic terms.

401
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,510
(Economic terms)

402
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,530
- This is difficult.
- Economy.

403
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,170
I'll write the recent one.

404
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,030
- This is mine.
- What?

405
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,640
I know what you're talking about.

406
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,670
It should have something
to do with the economy.

407
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,270
- You are not supposed to insist.
- Okay. Good.

408
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,090
Captain Yang, do you want me
to do it right or not?

409
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,780
If you do well, you will
come up in the next round.

410
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,280
- Really?
- We have one more question.

411
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,050
- An economic term?
- All right.

412
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,460
You have five seconds.

413
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,520
You should explain what it means.

414
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,830
- What?
- Your answer.

415
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,630
Hey. Wait.

416
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,390
You should explain
what your answer means.

417
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,230
- I should change my answer.
- That's not right.

418
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,340
- Does it have to be correct?
- Of course.

419
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,740
You should give the correct answer.

420
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,060
(Inflation)

421
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,710
Then I should go
with something I know.

422
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,880
One, two, three. Open.

423
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,900
(Will 5 members or more
give different answers?)

424
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,080
I knew he'd write that.

425
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,110
Right. That's what Se Chan knows.
It's inflation.

426
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,220
Hang on.

427
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,310
Explain the word.

428
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,310
- Inflation, an increase in prices.
- Okay.

429
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,880
Inflation...

430
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,140
- in an economic recession
- Okay.

431
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,280
What about this?

432
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,590
- Big step.
- A rise in interest rates.

433
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,620
Did you write big step?

434
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,330
- Hey.
- By 0.5 percent.

435
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,460
Next. What is that?

436
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,230
- Big step.
- What did Haha write?

437
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,870
DC.

438
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,830
What did you say?

439
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,930
Discount.

440
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,890
- What did he say?
- Discount?

441
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,560
- Isn't it an economic term?
- What's that?

442
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,870
- DC.
- What about it?

443
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,510
- Why? Go ahead.
- We'll do some research first.

444
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,140
- Is it an economics term?
- Next, Ji Hyo.

445
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,640
My answer is "IMF"
as in the currency crisis.

446
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,410
- What does it stand for?
- Correct.

447
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,950
- Technically, it doesn't mean that.
- That's right.

448
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,860
- The IMF is...
- People collected gold, you know.

449
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,050
- That's right.
- But...

450
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,680
- the IMF...
- And US dollar bills.

451
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,630
- It's Ji Hyo. Let it count.
- Right.

452
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,460
- IMF...
- What caused the financial crisis?

453
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,650
- What caused it?
- Yes.

454
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,290
- It was a currency crisis.
- I asked what caused it.

455
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,370
Because there was a crisis
with the currency, I guess.

456
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,560
- The IMF...
- She's right.

457
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,260
- That's correct.
- Okay. We'll let it count.

458
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,710
- Good. Let's move on.
- That's correct.

459
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,770
- Please explain, So Min.
- It's correct. It stands for...

460
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,010
- "Save, share, exchange, reuse."
- SSER.

461
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,110
- The SSER movement.
- That's correct!

462
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,040
- Yes, that's right.
- It's an economics term.

463
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,170
- That's right.
- The SSER movement.

464
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,990
- We all participated in it.
- Don't you know this?

465
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,120
- "Discount" is a correct answer.
- "Save, share, exchange, reuse."

466
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,260
- Correct.
- Next.

467
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,180
- My answer is "barter."
- "Barter."

468
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
(The old economic system appeared.)

469
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,890
- Before people started using money.
- That's correct.

470
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,460
Before cash was used,
barter dominated economies.

471
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,260
- Correct.
- Okay.

472
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,500
Finally,
we all wrote correct answers.

473
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,530
- Hey, Se Chan.
- It's different since I moved up.

474
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,530
Se Chan, I wrote "barter"
that no one else wrote.

475
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,760
I know that. Good job.

476
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,610
- I hope my name will be picked.
- I'll pick three balls.

477
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,840
- Okay.
- Please show me a miracle.

478
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,430
- I lost 100 points.
- Great!

479
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,510
- My score is minus 100.
- One of them is Haha.

480
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,640
- Haha, Haha, and Jae Suk.
- Okay!

481
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,250
(Haha, Haha, and Jae Suk)

482
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,270
Okay!

483
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,350
(Se Chan failed again.)

484
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,380
How could you miss it every time?
What's wrong with you?

485
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,490
Really?

486
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,550
- Are my answers even in there?
- Haha gets 60 points.

487
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,590
- Se Chan.
- Okay.

488
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,550
- I need more points urgently.
- Right. I should change it.

489
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
- If you don't...
- Here goes the last question.

490
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,260
- Can I change the order?
- Yes, you can.

491
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,290
- Suk Jin, switch seats with Haha.
- Okay.

492
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,000
- This is fun.
- Move. Go down.

493
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,260
- This is fun.
- Yes, I've moved up.

494
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,340
(Haha got demoted,
and So Min stays in her seat again.)

495
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,530
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

496
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,270
- It's different now that he's here.
- Of course.

497
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,510
Jae Suk is so reliable.

498
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,980
Why do you favor him?

499
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,880
- Do you know what "big step" is?
- Do you know the term?

500
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,270
- Do you know the term?
- Yes.

501
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,450
All right.

502
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,720
You punk, the only term you knew
was "inflation."

503
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,720
- What did you just say?
- My gosh.

504
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,150
- That petty idiot.
- "Petty idiot?"

505
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,650
- What's his problem?
- You used to be a mere bike thief.

506
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Leave, you punk!

507
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,520
For this question,
you all need to be...

508
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,860
- on the same wavelength.
- Okay.

509
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,370
- I hope to get some points.
- I guess we need more wit.

510
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,600
Write one of the special cities
or metropolitan cities in Korea.

511
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,370
(Including the special self-governing city
and province)

512
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,560
- I'm at the bottom.
- You're not allowed to give hints.

513
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,170
- I'm at the bottom.
- You guys know, right?

514
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,610
- No hints.
- "You brat!"

515
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,750
(Everyone started giving hints.)

516
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,750
- I'm at the bottom.
- We should write different cities?

517
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,350
- "You see, you brat."
- Don't give one another a hint.

518
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,880
(Everyone makes loud noises
to give a hint.)

519
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,540
- "Honjeoobseye."
- "You punk!"

520
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,010
- "Mendorong ttottot."
- "You punk!"

521
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,180
"Honjeoobseye."

522
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,180
My goodness. Don't write this one.

523
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,050
- Hey, I'll write that one.
- Oh, gosh. No.

524
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,630
- You can't do that.
- Everyone.

525
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,000
- My gosh.
- Hey.

526
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,630
- My goodness.
- You punks.

527
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,340
Hold on. A metropolitan city?

528
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,130
Or a special city.

529
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,160
It's not easy.

530
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,740
- Five, four,
- Write your hometown.

531
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,740
- three, two...
- I'll write what you wouldn't.

532
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,110
- My goodness.
- It's not easy.

533
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,510
Wait. They might not write this one.

534
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,450
- Somebody should go with "whale."
- I write an easy one.

535
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,170
- I gave up on the city.
- All right.

536
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,910
- The city of soccer.
- Time's up.

537
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,120
Okay.

538
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,860
- Here.
- I wrote this. Good.

539
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,650
- Busan.
- Seoul Special City.

540
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,260
- Daegu.
- Good.

541
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,460
- Is it a direct-controlled city?
- Incheon is a metropolitan city.

542
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,000
- It's been renamed.
- What's wrong with him?

543
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,290
- I'm relieved.
- Let me check.

544
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,390
- Two of you chose Seoul.
- Daejeon?

545
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,470
(Both Jae Suk and Ji Hyo write
Seoul.)

546
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,000
- Wait. Two of you wrote Incheon.
- Why?

547
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,400
- Gosh. Why did you write Incheon?
- Why did you guys do that?

548
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,980
Haha wrote "JeJu Metropolitan City."

549
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,340
- Hey, Jeju is...
- Jeju is not a metropolitan city.

550
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,900
- a special self-governing province.
- What's wrong with him?

551
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,640
Haha wrote "JeJu Metropolitan City."

552
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,010
(Everyone bursts with anger.)

553
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,810
(Jeju is
a special self-governing province!)

554
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,540
- Jeju is not a metropolitan city!
- Gosh, that...

555
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,950
- I can't believe him.
- That idiot!

556
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,180
That idiot.

557
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,550
Are you serious?

558
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,520
- My gosh. That's hilarious.
- It's a self-governing province.

559
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,630
- My gosh. How...
- Tell Dream not to watch this.

560
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,390
- Did you try to be funny?
- Why did you change your answer?

561
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,740
- He talked about a whale.
- Did you? Hey.

562
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,260
Hey, did anyone pick Gwangju?

563
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,760
- I mean...
- Hey, Jeju is...

564
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,060
a special self-governing province.

565
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,480
Why did you
speak in Gwangju dialect?

566
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,250
Suk Jin said he'd write it,
so I changed my answer.

567
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,770
- I thought she'd write it.
- Let's try one more time.

568
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,850
- It's an interesting result.
- I don't understand.

569
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,410
- You acted so arrogantly.
- "Jeju Metropolitan City?"

570
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,350
You kept shouting the Jeju dialect
"mendorong ttottot."

571
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,220
And you wrote
"Jeju Metropolitan City?"

572
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,230
- He's a weirdo.
- He also said "honjeoobseoye."

573
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,780
You shouldn't let Dream watch
this episode.

574
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,830
- I did it to drag him down.
- Haha.

575
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,560
- He's lying.
- There are cities and provinces.

576
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,630
I know. I intentionally wrote
an incorrect answer.

577
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,840
- Nonsense. "Mendorong ttottot!"
- What a joke.

578
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,660
Now, we'll move on...

579
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,740
- Is it over?
- Yes, the first mission is over.

580
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,380
- This is ridiculous.
- It was an easy question.

581
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,140
Se Chan, change the ranks
before we begin the next mission.

582
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,380
- For a game?
- Yes.

583
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,480
- Is the order important?
- Yes.

584
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,850
The order has been decided.
We'll prepare for the next mission.

585
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,450
That was hilarious.

586
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,450
(The new ranks have been announced.)

587
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,410
They brought a strange machine.
What do we do?

588
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,380
- It can tell if you're lying.
- You mean, it's a lie detector?

589
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,330
In this mission, you need luck
and a good hunch.

590
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,050
It's Did It Go through?

591
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,330
There are 30 outlets on the walls.
Can you see them?

592
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,760
- Yes.
- Why are there so many outlets?

593
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,760
But only six of them work.

594
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,900
- Six of them?
- I see.

595
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,480
Starting with the captain,
in the order of your ranks,

596
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,850
put on the pad of the low-frequency
therapy and call a number.

597
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,450
You get 30 points if you choose
an outlet that doesn't work.

598
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,510
(If it works, they get 30 points.
If not, they get eliminated.)

599
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,090
If it works, you get eliminated.

600
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,410
- Right away?
- Yes.

601
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,010
You'll repeat this starting with
the member who's first in rank.

602
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,520
Then the member who's first in rank
is at an advantage.

603
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,190
Right. But you never know
what Se Chan will choose.

604
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,000
- Is this a real machine?
- He might fail.

605
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,090
(The member who's first in rank
will go first.)

606
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,930
He's spraying water on it
to make it more intense.

607
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,930
(The muscle relaxation massage
for the members who ran all morning)

608
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,470
- Is it strong?
- No, it's not so strong.

609
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,440
- On my bare skin?
- My gosh.

610
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,640
- Of course.
- It'll kick in easily.

611
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,010
It'll kick in easily
if you put it on there.

612
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,710
When Se Chan calls a number,
one of you should plug it in.

613
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,940
- Okay.
- Numbers from 1 to 30?

614
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,010
Yes.

615
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,300
Will he pass if he endures it?

616
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,110
No. Even if you try to endure it,
we'll know.

617
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,770
- Really?
- Will it be turned off right away?

618
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,010
She should unplug it.

619
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,720
Please unplug it right away, okay?

620
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,780
Promise me. Based on what I heard,
it should be unplugged right away.

621
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,460
Look at her face.

622
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,930
I don't think
she'll unplug it right away.

623
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,730
This isn't the first time, you know.

624
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,500
Please call a number.

625
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,760
(Which number will he choose?)

626
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,620
- Number 12.
- Okay.

627
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,400
- You picked one in the middle.
- Yes.

628
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,440
- You should consider the location.
- I wonder if it's a fake.

629
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,640
- You should consider the location.
- I wonder if it's a fake.

630
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,360
- That's right.
- Could it be fake?

631
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,410
You'll get 30 points
if it doesn't work.

632
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,480
If not, you'll get eliminated.

633
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,480
It's advantageous to go first
considering the probability.

634
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,270
(Only 6 out of 30 outlets work.)

635
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,150
You never know.
He might get eliminated.

636
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,750
(There's a 20 percent chance
of getting a massage.)

637
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,390
(What could be the result of
the first choice?)

638
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,110
(Groaning)

639
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,280
Unplug it now. Pull it out.

640
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,850
(The low-frequency therapy machine
is turned on.)

641
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,850
Unplug it.

642
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,550
Does it really hurt?

643
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,560
(The unlucky guy got eliminated
despite the 20 percent chance.)

644
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,640
Are you not faking it?

645
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,100
- Was it intense?
- You should unplug it immediately.

646
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,860
(She hasn't unplugged it yet.)

647
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,910
Was it that strong?

648
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,710
(The baby octopus flails
after the low-frequency massage.)

649
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,450
- Jae Suk, it's true.
- No way.

650
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,270
- You'll see what I mean.
- Okay.

651
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,250
- Se Chan is out. Next.
- Gosh.

652
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,450
- Number 12...
- Since you gained weight,

653
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,840
you look funnier
when you react like that.

654
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,990
- Jae Suk, it's no joke.
- Hey.

655
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:21,190
- There are five real outlets left.
- Correct.

656
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,120
- Number 12 was a real outlet.
- All right. Here.

657
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,590
The members who try earlier
than the others are at an advantage.

658
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,470
So I won't choose a small number.
I'll go with number 21.

659
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,470
You know how Jae Suk always...

660
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,700
- He always picks a bad one.
- He could smell it.

661
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,360
Yes, he always picks a bad one.

662
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,530
He never picks a good one.

663
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,760
- Number 12 was real, right?
- Here we go. All right.

664
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,210
So Min, just plug it in now.

665
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,640
One, two, three.

666
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,680
(Will he get unlucky as usual
and get a massage?)

667
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,980
One, two, three.

668
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,680
Plug it now.

669
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,150
One, two, three.

670
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,490
See?

671
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,540
- It's a fake.
- Number three.

672
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,220
(Number 21 is a fake.)

673
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,390
You survived and got 30 points.

674
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,390
- Thirty points?
- Yes.

675
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,690
- Which one should I choose?
- Next.

676
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,790
- Good.
- Is number 21 fake?

677
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,960
- Number 12 was real, right?
- Yes.

678
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,400
- Jong Kook, come here.
- Then shall I go with number 11?

679
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,970
(He figures two consecutive numbers
are unlikely real outlets.)

680
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,530
I thought that too.
I was going to pick number 13.

681
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,940
- Number 20?
- I'll go with number 11.

682
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,510
- Number 11.
- Number 11? Okay.

683
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,210
- Here we go.
- I thought the same thing.

684
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,480
(Could Detective Kim's guess
be right?)

685
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,710
There.

686
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,840
- It's a fake.
- Pass.

687
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,610
- Okay.
- You got 30 points.

688
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,180
- Who's next?
- Me.

689
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,340
(Number 11 turned out to be fake.
Jong Kook got 30 points.)

690
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,780
(Next up is Ji Hyo.)

691
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,950
What's the first number
that pops into your mind?

692
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,490
- Number 2.
- Number 2? Okay.

693
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,890
- Ji Hyo, are you ready?
- But I think that number two is...

694
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,930
(Ji Hyo chose a small number.)

695
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,350
(What could be the result?)

696
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,620
- Pass.
- Okay.

697
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,730
Really?

698
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,820
- Okay. Good.
- Then I...

699
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,400
- So Min.
- Am I doing it the right way?

700
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,360
- I'll help you.
- I'm so nervous. What do I do?

701
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,440
- Number 10.
- Okay. Number 10.

702
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,970
Should I go with number 1?
Or number 10?

703
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,170
- Number 1 or 10?
- Which number?

704
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,140
- I'll go with number ten.
- Okay. Turn around.

705
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,650
Okay.

706
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,250
(Real)

707
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,840
(Screaming)

708
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,310
It was the wrong outlet.

709
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,510
(The prank addict plugged it
into the real outlet.)

710
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,220
- I plugged it into the wrong one.
- It says "Real."

711
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,120
- It was a mistake.
- He got back at her.

712
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,460
- He got back at her.
- I made a mistake.

713
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,520
(Jae Suk avenged her betrayal.)

714
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,590
- I got confused.
- Hey!

715
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,850
I'm sorry.

716
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,430
We shouldn't leave it to him.

717
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,520
That felt so weird.

718
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,000
- Don't make a mistake again.
- Okay.

719
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,290
- I'm sorry!
- You shouldn't do that.

720
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,470
I won't make a mistake again.

721
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,240
- I see why you made a mistake.
- I'm sorry.

722
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,070
- Right. It's close to number ten.
- They're close to each other.

723
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,740
- It felt like...
- I'm sorry!

724
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,010
- ten frogs jumping in my arm.
- I won't make a mistake again.

725
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,800
I felt like I had ten frogs
jumping in my arm.

726
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,720
- Number 10.
- Number 10. Okay.

727
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,420
- It's understandable.
- Face the front.

728
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,690
- Face the front. Come on.
- Turn around.

729
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,350
- You'll do it again, right?
- No, I won't.

730
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,420
- You'll do it again, right?
- No way. He won't do it again.

731
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,760
- Pass.
- I'm relieved.

732
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,280
- Ten frogs were jumping in my arm.
- I see.

733
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,500
- It's like buzzing.
- I mean... That's right.

734
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,170
Next up is Haha.

735
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,820
- He'll go with number 16.
- Number 16?

736
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,170
- No. Wait. I didn't choose it.
- Number 16.

737
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,760
I said, I didn't choose that number!

738
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,260
Thank you.

739
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,300
- He didn't choose the number.
- You didn't plug it?

740
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,440
- He didn't pick it.
- Number 16.

741
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,180
- Let's do it again.
- He passed since he tried it.

742
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,370
- Really?
- That's a relief.

743
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,680
- Seok Sam, you're up.
- I hope he'll pick a real one.

744
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
(Next up is Seok Sam.)

745
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,150
Stop smirking like that.

746
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,650
It's weaker when the guys do it.

747
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,850
(Screaming)

748
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,350
(The low-frequency therapy machine
is turned on.)

749
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,050
Why? Was he wearing it?

750
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,060
(The veteran MC keeps
making the same mistake.)

751
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,970
- Darn you.
- I didn't know you were wearing it.

752
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,260
Gosh. Why you little...

753
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,100
- I didn't know you were wearing it.
- This machine is unbelievable.

754
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,410
I really didn't know.

755
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,010
I'll go with number 29.

756
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,510
- Number 29?
- Number 29.

757
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,450
It looks lonely.

758
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,250
- Let's go.
- I have a bad feeling about this.

759
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,610
- It's a fake.
- Pass.

760
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,010
- Nice.
- We have to pick wisely.

761
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,010
- It's very intense.
- It's time for someone to fail.

762
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,960
- But no one has yet.
- Oh, you are...

763
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,020
- You're calculating?
- Yes.

764
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,280
- Back to number one. Please sit.
- I'm anxious.

765
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,290
- Me?
- Yes.

766
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,590
- Is it my turn?
- There are five real ones left.

767
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,400
Does anyone want to plug it in?

768
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,560
I'll do it.

769
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,600
- He needs something to do.
- Okay. I understand.

770
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,910
- Okay. Yes.
- This is it, right?

771
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,370
Wait.
You shouldn't adjust the intensity.

772
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,010
- You shouldn't...
- I didn't.

773
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,010
- Right. He didn't adjust it.
- I left it in an intense mode.

774
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,150
Please go and check it.

775
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,450
- Okay.
- I wasn't lying, right?

776
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,310
- Oh, no. It would hurt.
- Really?

777
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,310
He increased the intensity
when it was set to a weak mode.

778
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,510
You shouldn't have changed it.

779
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,780
You could've died.

780
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,610
All right.

781
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,390
(Meanwhile, Seok Sam plugs it
into the real outlet.)

782
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,430
Now, choose a number.

783
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,790
(The revenge has begun.)

784
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,160
- I...
- What number do you want?

785
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,170
(What? Is he enduring it?)

786
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,590
- What number do you want?
- I'll go with number 22.

787
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,530
- Wait. Are you enduring it?
- What's going on?

788
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,360
- Come on. Mister.
- Why?

789
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,710
- Why did you pull this out?
- Gosh.

790
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,410
(Jae Suk unplugged it.)

791
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,240
Hey, why did you unplug it?

792
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,710
- You shouldn't do that.
- It doesn't work when unplugged.

793
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,410
- Why?
- You shouldn't unplug it.

794
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,810
I was going to plug it in
when I was ready...

795
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,150
- after choosing a number.
- Come on.

796
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,920
- What's wrong with that?
- Right. That was a good idea.

797
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,950
Right?

798
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,810
(Once again, he makes it obvious
that he's waiting for a chance.)

799
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,820
(Then he plugs it.)

800
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,930
Then...

801
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,260
- I pick...
- Mister.

802
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,090
- number 22.
- You reduced the intensity.

803
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,400
- Now...
- Unplug it.

804
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,090
- Gosh. Hey.
- That's how it feels.

805
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,640
(Groaning and laughing)

806
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,510
Hey, unplug it. Turn it off.

807
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,940
Pull it out!

808
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,070
It hurt.

809
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,100
It's intense, right?

810
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
My gosh.

811
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,070
- You looked like you were dancing.
- Gosh.

812
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,510
I want Jae Suk to fail.

813
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,310
I want him to fail too. What number?

814
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,510
I pick number five.

815
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,510
- Number 5?
- Number 5?

816
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,080
Number 5. I'm sure of it.

817
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,260
- Number 5.
- Here we go.

818
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,780
(Someone must fail by now.)

819
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,400
(How will it turn out this time?)

820
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Will he fail?

821
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,400
(Screaming in pain)

822
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Did it kick in?

823
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
(It kicked in!)

824
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,590
- Did it kick in?
- Turn it off.

825
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,330
(The second member to fail
got caught while acting up.)

826
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,600
I'm next, right? Okay.
I'll go with number three.

827
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,710
I pick number three.

828
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,370
- Number three?
- Yes. I'm ready.

829
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,250
Okay. Good.

830
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,480
I already picked number 3
when Jae Suk picked number 5.

831
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,110
That's incredible.

832
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,110
- Next.
- Ji Hyo, you're up.

833
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,550
She calculated the probability.

834
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,780
- I'm sure she'll pass.
- Really?

835
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,550
- She calculated the probability?
- She analyzed the numbers...

836
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,320
that turned out to be real.

837
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,350
- She did?
- Yes, she's done analyzing.

838
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,660
- Really?
- Yes.

839
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,790
- The one who wrote "Tottenham?"
- She wrote "Tottenham."

840
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,860
Yes, the one who wrote "Tottenham"
did it.

841
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,360
- She wrote "nyangjungjichuk."
- She wrote "Tottenham."

842
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,330
- I didn't know...
- She wrote "nyangjungjichuk" too.

843
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,170
- A cat's punch.
- She wrote "nyangjungjichuk."

844
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,260
- Yes, she did.
- I can't...

845
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,510
- I knew it was a wrong answer.
- She wrote "nyangjungjichuk."

846
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,800
- I wrote "nyang" intentionally.
- It was funny.

847
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,650
The ugly, the old,
and the one who wrote "Tottenham."

848
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,650
(The ugly, the old,
and the one who wrote "Tottenham.")

849
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,190
- Like a movie title.
- Right.

850
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,310
She explained it to me.
She's done analyzing.

851
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,820
- Good.
- What number did you choose?

852
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,390
(Real: Numbers 5, 12, Fake:
Numbers 2, 3, 10, 11, 16, 21, 29)

853
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,400
Hey, Tottenham, which one?

854
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,430
I will...

855
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
go with number four.

856
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,400
- Number four.
- Ms. Tottenham.

857
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,500
"You'll survive
if you risk your life."

858
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,700
("Probability is the science."
by Songttenham)

859
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,330
(What could be the result of
her analysis of all possible cases?)

860
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,330
- "You'll die if you try to live."
- Number seven hasn't been picked.

861
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,410
(Groaning)

862
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,270
(She failed to
calculate the probability.)

863
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,610
- She has finished calculating it.
- Unplug it.

864
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,340
(She picked a real outlet
after a thorough calculation.)

865
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,990
- She has finished calculating it.
- Unplug it.

866
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,390
- She has finished calculating it.
- What's the point of calculating?

867
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,390
- It was pointless.
- Tottenham didn't let us down.

868
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,580
- Nyangjungjichuk.
- She says it hurts.

869
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,230
- It hurts.
- Nyangjungjichuk.

870
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,700
I knew that Tottenham would fail.

871
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,260
- It hurts.
- She's out.

872
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,620
- Oh, no. Tottenham.
- It hurts.

873
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,530
- It's my turn.
- There are three real ones left.

874
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,530
I'll go with number 18.

875
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,860
(Suk Jin picked number 18.)

876
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,710
(Screaming)

877
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,600
(Number 18 was a real outlet.)

878
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,770
- How many are there left?
- I'll go with number 19.

879
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,980
- Number 19?
- Number 19.

880
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,980
(Groaning)

881
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,370
- It hurts, right?
- She's out.

882
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,340
See? I told you so.

883
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,510
Haha and Jong Kook are
the two finalists.

884
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,660
I can't believe
I survived this long.

885
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,490
We have 3 outlets left.
Numbers from 23 to 25.

886
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,120
- I pick number 25. Let's go.
- You have no choice.

887
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,190
I'll go with number 25. Let's go.

888
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,050
It was no joke.

889
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,400
(If Jong Kook fails,
Haha wins automatically.)

890
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,500
Oh, it kicked in. Gosh.

891
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,790
(Jong Kook is out.)

892
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,330
- All right. Haha is the winner.
- Yes.

893
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,440
As a result,

894
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,910
Se Chan got zero points
in this mission.

895
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,510
Jae Suk and Ji Hyo won 30 points.

896
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,600
Suk Jin won 90 points.

897
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,720
So Min won 120 points.

898
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,010
- Jong Kook got 180 points.
- Oh, my.

899
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,920
And Haha got 210 points.

900
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,610
- I should've won 210 points.
- Haha, I'm impressed.

901
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,730
Mendorong ttottot!

902
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,320
Jeju dialect, yes!

903
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,760
Now, we'll move to the back...

904
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,320
- for the last mission.
- Let's go!

905
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,400
- What is this?
- What is it?

906
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,740
Oh, my. It's moving.

907
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,670
I guess it's to make us fall off.
Right?

908
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,860
(Shouting)

909
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,070
- What is this?
- It's a conveyor belt.

910
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,180
What is this for?

911
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,980
I'll explain the rules of
your last mission.

912
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,510
This is
a very interesting formation.

913
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,810
(This is
a very interesting formation.)

914
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,450
Come down. You might fall off
while acting up like last time.

915
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,150
- Gosh, seriously.
- What's with that face?

916
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,720
- Let's leave him be.
- I've hurt...

917
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,610
I've gotten a cut on my eyebrow
while acting up like this.

918
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,660
Of course.

919
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,390
- "I'm sorry!"
- I'm sorry.

920
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,400
First,
I'll announce your current scores.

921
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,170
- Am I still in 1st place?
- The person in 1st place is...

922
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,000
Jae Suk with 540 points.

923
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,470
- Great!
- I'm impressed.

924
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,800
And Se Chan placed 2nd
with 350 points.

925
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,770
- I lost points.
- Okay.

926
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,600
- Haha placed 3rd with 270 points.
- I should've done better.

927
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,680
- Okay.
- I'm not even in third place.

928
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,370
Jong Kook placed 4th
with 110 points.

929
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,770
- What?
- What? Am I...

930
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,870
- That's unexpected.
- Am I ranked that low?

931
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,780
So Min placed 5th with 90 points.

932
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,390
- Gosh. I'm in fifth place.
- It's because you lost points.

933
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,260
Suk Jin placed 6th with 70 points.

934
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,620
Ji Hyo is in last place
with 60 points.

935
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,120
The winner will probably be
1 of the top 3, right?

936
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
- You can say that.
- Can I turn the game around?

937
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
- That's possible.
- Of course.

938
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,970
"Can I?"

939
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,290
- "Can I?"
- "Can I?"

940
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,400
"Can I?"

941
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,700
- Why did you drop the honorifics?
- "Can I turn the game around?"

942
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,100
- "Hey, young man."
- "Can I turn the game around?"

943
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,770
- "Yes, you can."
- It came out wrong.

944
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,600
- I meant to use honorifics.
- It's possible.

945
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
All right.

946
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,650
- To give you a chance to win,
- Yes.

947
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,920
we'll let the bottom two
choose their team members.

948
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,650
- You mean, us?
- I see.

949
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,310
- So Min is on our team.
- Okay.

950
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,260
- This is a perfect combination.
- Right. It's neat.

951
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,810
- Indeed.
- Don't you want one more member?

952
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,430
- The last mission is...
- What is it?

953
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,390
a Running Man style game.

954
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,700
It requires physical strength
and wit. It's Marathon Quiz.

955
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,790
The conveyor belt is moving.

956
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,200
I think we'll have to run on it.

957
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,590
The representative member has to
run in this direction...

958
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,830
on the moving conveyor belt
and look back at the others...

959
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,770
to see what they describe
while running.

960
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,910
(The representative member has to
guess a keyword while running.)

961
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,910
- We'll win this.
- I see. Just like...

962
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,180
- Speak With Your Actions?
- We'll definitely win.

963
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,210
I like the game.

964
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,810
- The other members have to...
- While running?

965
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,080
describe a proverb
with your actions.

966
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,110
- I see.
- With actions?

967
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,110
The member has to look back
while running.

968
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,610
You have three minutes
in each round.

969
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,780
- Three minutes?
- Both teams can pass keywords.

970
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,020
You just have to run
for three minutes.

971
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,230
Yes, but you'll start at Level One,

972
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,590
and the speed will
increase gradually.

973
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,060
If you fall off, the round ends.

974
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,240
- Got it.
- Okay.

975
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,530
Two members of each team will
take turns.

976
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,800
- We'll have four rounds in total.
- Okay.

977
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,710
- Two of us will take turns?
- Correct.

978
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,330
Then the two of you should run.

979
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,510
No. We'll choose the member to run
randomly.

980
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,800
(The representative member will be
randomly chosen.)

981
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,540
- Really?
- Yes.

982
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,810
- The four names are on them.
- Okay.

983
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,890
They all like chatting.

984
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,660
- The member to run, right?
- Correct.

985
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,260
- We should do it with actions only.
- So Min.

986
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,390
- It's Jae Suk.
- Okay.

987
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,690
- I'm relieved.
- Gosh.

988
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,850
- Jae Suk, please put on the gear.
- Okay.

989
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,000
- And...
- We're not allowed to speak.

990
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,820
So Min, this is "To move to Gangnam
following a friend."

991
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,360
- "A friend."
- "Following."

992
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,670
- "Following."
- "Following."

993
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,260
- "To move to Gangnam."
- "To move to Gangnam."

994
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,600
- Okay.
- This is for the word "friend."

995
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,800
Now... You have three minutes.

996
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,980
- Three minutes.
- You've got this.

997
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,370
- Now...
- So Min, is that it?

998
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,480
I'll describe the last word.

999
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,070
Everyone, we'll begin now.

1000
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,310
Turn on the conveyor belt.

1001
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,010
(The game begins.)

1002
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,190
- That's easy.
- What does it say?

1003
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,110
(To swim on the ground)

1004
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,310
Hey, this is not easy.

1005
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,080
(To swim on the ground)

1006
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,230
(It's too fast!)

1007
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,400
It's too fast.

1008
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,700
(The treadmill is
moving quite fast.)

1009
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,350
- I can't see you.
- Captain!

1010
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,470
Hey, I can't see you.

1011
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,620
- Come here.
- Jae Suk, look at us.

1012
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,000
It's really fast.

1013
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,090
Jae Suk, look at us.

1014
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,330
- Is it okay?
- Look at us.

1015
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
What is it?

1016
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,800
Hey, don't just run
and try to guess the proverb.

1017
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,910
- What is it?
- One at a time.

1018
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,070
To swim on the ground.

1019
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,100
- Okay.
- Correct.

1020
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,100
Hurry up.

1021
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,110
(They barely managed to
get the first question right.)

1022
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,220
You have to look at us.

1023
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,610
I can't see you. Move to this side.

1024
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,490
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

1025
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,010
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1026
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:05,320
(To hit a rock with an egg)

1027
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,660
To hit a rock with an egg.

1028
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,820
- Good.
- Okay.

1029
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,460
To hit a rock with an egg.

1030
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,500
(One minute has passed,
and the speed goes up.)

1031
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
What is it?

1032
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,790
- He moved on to the next level.
- Yes.

1033
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,240
It's so fast.

1034
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,300
Why is it so fast?

1035
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,640
- Jae Suk, look at us.
- Jae Suk.

1036
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,600
(To spit in a lying position)

1037
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
To eat rice cakes
in a lying position.

1038
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,770
- No.
- No.

1039
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,510
You're not allowed to make a noise.

1040
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,220
What is it?

1041
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,870
Hey, you should look back at them
while running.

1042
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,920
Jae Suk.

1043
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,510
- To spit in a lying position.
- Correct.

1044
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,350
You have one minute left.

1045
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,120
It's getting even faster.

1046
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,890
(As two minutes have passed,
the speed goes up to another level.)

1047
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Look at us.

1048
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,500
- How should we describe it?
- Jae Suk.

1049
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,760
(Old habits die hard.)

1050
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,970
- That's good.
- What is it?

1051
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,240
- Jae Suk, look at us.
- Look!

1052
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,030
One, two, three. Look!

1053
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,010
- What?
- Look!

1054
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,710
- I don't know. Pass.
- Pass.

1055
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,150
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk, are you exercising?

1056
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,310
He's just running.
He won't try to get questions right.

1057
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,350
I can't look back.

1058
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,010
Jae Suk, look at us!

1059
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,730
- I can't look back at you!
- Is he here to exercise or what?

1060
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,690
- Are you here to run?
- I can't look back!

1061
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,700
(He looks like he's at a gym.)

1062
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,460
Jae Suk, look at us!

1063
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,860
Let's get
just one more question right!

1064
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,240
Let's get this one right! It's easy!

1065
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,060
- Jae Suk!
- I can't look back!

1066
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,440
- Time's up!
- Gosh.

1067
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,710
- We got a lot though.
- Yes, we got a lot.

1068
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,530
Jae Suk can't look behind him.

1069
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,680
- It's too fast.
- You answered four correctly.

1070
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,570
- If I don't get selected...
- You answered four correctly.

1071
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,310
- I should be the one to run.
- We'll pick out the next runner.

1072
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,990
Unless it's Jong Kook, we're doomed.

1073
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,580
- The runner is Suk Jin.
- We're doomed.

1074
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,550
- Don't you lie.
- It's true.

1075
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,230
(They're doomed.)

1076
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,930
- Don't lie.
- Be honest, will you?

1077
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,930
- Choose again while we watch.
- They...

1078
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,260
They'll never answer four correctly.

1079
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,740
Suk Jin will never get four right.

1080
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,400
We'll stay close to the edge.

1081
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,030
- Okay.
- Only that way you'll see us.

1082
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,330
(Team Suk Jin gets in position.)

1083
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,770
- All right.
- You have three minutes.

1084
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,950
- Start.
- Here we go.

1085
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,210
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin!

1086
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,580
(A dog's life is a good life.)

1087
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,340
- Suk Jin.
- A dog.

1088
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,010
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1089
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,190
- A dog.
- That's right.

1090
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,780
- Suk Jin, keep looking.
- A nap?

1091
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,930
- Look at him run.
- A dog's full.

1092
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,050
No.

1093
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,670
- Look.
- Being a dog...

1094
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,900
A dog and seven?

1095
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,260
Of course not.

1096
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,330
That isn't the number.

1097
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,440
- A dog.
- Here.

1098
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,440
- You can't talk.
- A dog.

1099
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,940
He will never get this.

1100
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,070
Seven? A dog and seven.

1101
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,650
- Don't give him numbers.
- Pass!

1102
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,920
Forget about the number.

1103
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,040
- Don't do that.
- He'll never get it.

1104
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
(It is darker under the lamp.)

1105
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,540
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1106
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,050
(It is darker under the lamp.)

1107
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,220
What?

1108
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,760
(Huffing)

1109
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,290
It sped up.

1110
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,620
It sped up.

1111
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,440
- This is an easy one.
- This one's easy.

1112
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,530
Someone must be after Suk Jin.

1113
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,260
- Someone's after him.
- This is an easy one.

1114
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,240
- This one's easy.
- This is a bad moment for him.

1115
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,270
- Keep running!
- You're being followed.

1116
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,980
- Suk Jin, it's an easy one.
- He's being followed.

1117
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,340
You're being followed.

1118
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,010
- This is an easy one.
- Suk Jin.

1119
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,810
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1120
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,780
- Look.
- Suk Jin.

1121
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,610
(He runs as if he is being chased
by the Grim Reaper.)

1122
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,780
(But then...)

1123
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,580
- Oh, no.
- Don't give up.

1124
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,990
(But his legs start to give in.)

1125
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:27,200
(He is at the front gate
of the afterlife.)

1126
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,760
- Don't give up.
- It's an easy one.

1127
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,960
(His eyes are already giving in.)

1128
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,060
This is too easy.

1129
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,930
- Suk Jin.
- Don't give up.

1130
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
- All right.
- It's over for our dad.

1131
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,410
Somebody get him an oxygen tank!

1132
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,940
(His colleagues encourage him,
but he's close to passing out.)

1133
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,910
- He's being chased.
- Don't give up.

1134
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,970
Suk Jin, this is an easy one.

1135
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,040
- Suk Jin.
- Don't give up.

1136
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
- Do it.
- It's over.

1137
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,720
- Suk Jin!
- Keep going!

1138
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,140
- I...
- Stop.

1139
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,720
(Grunt)

1140
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,020
Suk Jin.

1141
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,220
(He gives up in the end.)

1142
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,350
Game over!

1143
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,560
(They end the race
with zero points.)

1144
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,660
"A dog's life is a good life."

1145
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,770
- Suk Jin was being chased.
- He was being chased.

1146
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,430
It was as if someone was after him.

1147
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,330
Suk Jin. Get him oxygen.

1148
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,200
Get him an oxygen tank!

1149
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,970
- Get him some oxygen.
- Are you all right?

1150
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,370
- Get yourself an oxygen tank.
- Are you okay?

1151
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,410
- I...
- Are you all right?

1152
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,080
Jae Suk's insane.

1153
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,350
I have to give it to Suk Jin.

1154
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,350
That was impressive.

1155
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,850
- His will to live...
- He was being chased by something.

1156
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,490
Suk Jin wanted to live.

1157
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,890
- Compare the height of acorns!
- Yes!

1158
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,520
Enemies...

1159
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,200
- find us during the worst times.
- Okay!

1160
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,490
(Team Ji Hyo stacks points
by following a stable plan.)

1161
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,220
- Small chilies are spicier.
- Okay!

1162
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,890
Haha.

1163
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,330
We need 6 to tie and 7 to win.

1164
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,370
- Let's aim for seven.
- Sure.

1165
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,830
- That's cool.
- Nicely put, Haha.

1166
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,140
All right.

1167
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,100
- I'm impressed Haha.
- Go!

1168
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,180
- Let's do this.
- Nicely said, Haha!

1169
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,810
"While it's warm."

1170
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,680
(You...)

1171
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,020
- "Welcome."
- Looking good, Haha.

1172
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,850
- Nicely put.
- I'm sorry.

1173
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,080
He apologized.

1174
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,890
(He apologizes for being dumb.)

1175
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,160
He apologized.

1176
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,350
- He'll be teased for three weeks.
- I know.

1177
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,620
I'm really sorry.

1178
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,830
- I found it charming.
- You can't give them a reason.

1179
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,890
Okay.

1180
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,790
The result of this game...

1181
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,540
could shake up the ranking
in every possible way.

1182
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,600
We'll win for sure.

1183
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,140
- Let's do this.
- He won't get any of them right.

1184
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,080
Check out Haha's pants.

1185
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,680
- And go.
- Look at Jong Kook first.

1186
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,310
- This one's easy.
- It's an easy one.

1187
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,950
Look at him run.
He's really bad at it.

1188
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,580
(An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth)

1189
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,540
- Be witty.
- No, look at me.

1190
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,950
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

1191
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,430
(Eating mustard in tears)

1192
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,580
- Go ahead.
- Here.

1193
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,060
(Eating mustard in tears)

1194
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,160
Eating mustard in tears.

1195
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,620
- Yes.
- Next.

1196
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,370
- Over here.
- Haha.

1197
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,660
(A frog in a well)

1198
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,970
- A frog in a well.
- Yes!

1199
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,200
- That is correct.
- Here we go!

1200
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,870
- A frog in a well.
- Yes!

1201
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,970
- That's...
- Here we go!

1202
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,810
Over here!

1203
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:03,120
(Lobsters side with crabs.)

1204
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,220
(They're getting nervous.)

1205
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,410
- It's an easy one.
- I know what it is.

1206
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,660
Here.

1207
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,790
Crabs...

1208
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,620
(That's it!)

1209
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,060
Haha's legs are giving in.

1210
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,700
Crabs...

1211
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,270
- Haha's legs are giving in.
- Over here.

1212
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,660
- Over here.
- Haha!

1213
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,640
- Haha's legs are giving in.
- Over here. Haha!

1214
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,180
He can't look behind him anymore.

1215
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,950
- Just this once.
- Haha.

1216
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,310
Look behind you.

1217
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,580
- Look behind you.
- Come this way.

1218
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,870
(Running at full speed)

1219
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,310
This is an easy one.

1220
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,040
(It's been a while since
Running Man lived up to its name.)

1221
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,680
- This is easy.
- It's an easy one.

1222
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,310
- Look at him run.
- Haha!

1223
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,060
- He doesn't want to fall.
- Look behind you.

1224
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,680
- It's an easy one.
- It's over.

1225
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,450
- Think!
- He can't look behind him.

1226
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,560
- What would this be?
- Think!

1227
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,060
- He can't look behind him.
- A crab.

1228
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,490
Right. And this?

1229
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,100
"While it's warm."

1230
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,040
- What can this be?
- Keep running!

1231
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,140
He can't turn his head.

1232
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,510
"Welcome."

1233
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,700
Looking good, Haha.

1234
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,540
- Go!
- Keep running for now.

1235
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,950
- Hold on.
- He can't look behind him.

1236
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,740
He can't turn his head.

1237
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,620
- But this is an easy one.
- He's almost done for.

1238
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,520
- Haha.
- Look at this.

1239
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,080
- He's almost done for.
- Five...

1240
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,680
- Haha.
- Haha!

1241
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,720
- Look at us.
- Three, two, one.

1242
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,350
This is an easy one.

1243
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,790
- Haha.
- Over here.

1244
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,330
- Look at us.
- Hey.

1245
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,700
Think.

1246
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,600
This isn't about who can run better.

1247
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,160
He's out of energy.

1248
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,270
(He gives up on the marathon.)

1249
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,910
- Haha did so well though.
- I know how tough it is.

1250
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,580
- You ran really well.
- I know.

1251
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,100
That was hilarious.

1252
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,310
It was "lobsters side with crabs."

1253
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,180
You answered four correctly,

1254
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,910
but Team Ji Hyo
is the ultimate winner.

1255
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,520
- Okay!
- Yes!

1256
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,220
- What was the answer?
- Haha.

1257
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,520
It was "lobsters side with crabs."

1258
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,720
And "frog in a well."

1259
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,580
Okay. Let's party.

1260
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,930
- I didn't come in last.
- Okay.

1261
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,430
Thanks to So Min...

1262
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,890
- So Min.
- You're an angel.

1263
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,930
(Every member on Team Ji Hyo
received 200 points.)

1264
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,220
You brought us fortune!

1265
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,470
You should've been the one to run.

1266
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,560
All right.

1267
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,740
Here's the final result.

1268
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,140
Those in 1st and 2nd place
will win the prize...

1269
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,410
while those in 6th and 7th
will receive the penalty.

1270
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,680
In first place is...

1271
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,910
(The race took part
in Sangam-dong itself.)

1272
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:16,270
(Who will win the cut-throat
Running Tag of Tails Race?)

1273
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,490
In first place...

1274
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,080
with 740 points is Jae Suk.

1275
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,950
(Jae Suk finished in 1st place.)

1276
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,160
(He's the first winner
of the Running Tag of Tails Race.)

1277
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,060
- What's the prize?
- Jae Suk...

1278
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,790
has won your favorite prize.
The Korean beef gift pack.

1279
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,020
- Yes!
- I knew it.

1280
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,370
- No way.
- And in second place...

1281
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,660
- with 550 points is Se Chan.
- Yes!

1282
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,640
Your prize is watermelons...

1283
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,600
that is not only sweet
but expensive.

1284
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,040
They will be delicious.

1285
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,580
(He wins sweet watermelons.)

1286
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,600
- All right!
- Why are they so lucky?

1287
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,740
And those who will receive
the penalty are...

1288
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,320
(Who will receive the penalty?)

1289
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,070
You are to link...

1290
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,750
seven people on the street
and create a long train.

1291
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,590
Unbelievable.

1292
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,020
(Receiving the penalty
are Suk Jin and...)

1293
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,730
If only we had won the final game.

1294
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,360
All right.

1295
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,860
Suk Jin.

1296
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,520
(He locates his target.)

1297
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,000
Ma'am, excuse me.

1298
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,540
Could I maybe lend a hand?

1299
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,000
You can stand behind me and...

1300
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,340
(She walks right past him.)

1301
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,610
Maybe we can...

1302
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,810
(His lack of confidence
led to a failed attempt.)

1303
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,170
I should search for people outside.

1304
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,820
Excuse me.

1305
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,650
Are you perhaps free?

1306
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,110
(Chuckling)

1307
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,250
If you're free...

1308
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,560
Darn, this is embarrassing.

1309
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,590
(His 2nd attempt
was also a failure.)

1310
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,320
Hello, sir.

1311
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,520
Do you...

1312
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,400
- have some time to spare?
- Sure.

1313
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,130
Can you walk around the block
grabbing onto my back?

1314
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,570
- Is it possible?
- Sure.

1315
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:45,630
(He manages to find his first tail.)

1316
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,940
I got someone to help me.

1317
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,940
- All right.
- Where are we going though?

1318
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,340
I'm not so sure myself.

1319
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,500
If you are not too busy,
can you join the train?

1320
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,650
- Me?
- Yes, get behind him.

1321
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,270
Luck will find those
who chose to help out today.

1322
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,980
Sir, could you join the train?

1323
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,650
I apologize for the inconvenience,

1324
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,480
but we'll all have
a bright future ahead of us.

1325
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,290
- Good luck.
- Let me see.

1326
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,460
Two, four...

1327
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,560
I'm sorry about this.

1328
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,400
I know it's embarrassing,
but consider this as gaining karma.

1329
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,500
Excuse me!

1330
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,960
(It's as if the citizens
are being punished.)

1331
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
I need two more people.
I'm sorry it's taking me so long.

1332
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,710
I'm so sorry.

1333
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,670
I'm sorry. Just please stay with me
a while longer.

1334
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,500
I'm sorry, but can you join us?

1335
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,610
I need two people.

1336
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,000
Please.

1337
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,150
(He successfully recruited people
to be the last tail.)

1338
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,610
Are you done?

1339
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,380
I love you.

1340
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,840
Why is he saying "I love you?"

1341
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,920
I love you.

1342
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,060
I love you all.

1343
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,090
Suk Jin made it.

1344
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,230
(Suk Jin made it.)

1345
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,420
Thank you. You'll be blessed.

1346
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,170
Thank you.

1347
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,790
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

1348
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,170
I need about six people
to become my tail.

1349
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,940
If you're not busy...

1350
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,110
Be my tail, guys.

1351
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,880
- Do I need to walk a lap?
- Say choo-choo, puff-puff too.

1352
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,250
Choo-choo, puff-puff?

1353
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:12,360
- Choo-choo.
- Puff-puff.

1354
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,750
(They have to say
a humiliating chant as well.)

1355
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:17,960
I'm sorry.

1356
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,000
Thank you.

1357
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,670
Let's take a photo to commemorate.

1358
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,340
Okay.

1359
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,380
(Yeoui Island in midsummer
where the hot sunlight is pouring)

1360
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,770
Hello.

1361
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,880
Well...

1362
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,980
Why am I here?

1363
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,920
This is Yeoui Island.

1364
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:44,920
I'm at Yeouido Park.

1365
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,650
What are we doing today?
Why am I here alone?

1366
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,380
We're all starting
at different locations, right?

1367
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,130
The weather is amazing.

1368
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,400
(Staggering)

1369
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,000
Did you film it?

1370
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,630
- Hi.
- Hello.

1371
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,670
- What are we doing separately?
- Hello.

1372
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:01,670
What's going on?

1373
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:06,230
Today, the winner is decided
based on individual mission funds.

1374
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,270
(Today, the winner is decided
based on individual mission funds.)

1375
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:12,210
Before we start, we'll give you
a mission fund as you want.

1376
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,650
(There's no limit.
They'll be given cash as they want.)

1377
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:14,750
What's the maximum amount?

1378
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,320
There's no limit.

1379
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,650
Give me 1,000 dollars.

1380
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,750
You won't give it to me.
You don't have 1,000 dollars.

1381
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,230
We'll give you cash.

1382
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:23,860
How much is that?

1383
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,630
We have enough.

1384
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,960
There's no limit to what I can say?

1385
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,170
Will you give me as much as I want?

1386
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,790
- We'll give you what you wrote.
- Okay.

1387
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,770
But if you wrote the most or
the least amount, you won't get it.

1388
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,770
Gosh, this is...

1389
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:42,880
If the person who wrote the most
or the least amount can't get it...

1390
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,040
(The person who wrote the most
or the least amount gets nothing.)

1391
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,820
You should think
about what others would've written.

1392
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,650
How much is the maximum amount?

1393
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,190
- There's no limit?
- Right. There's no limit.

1394
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,560
Gosh, so I can't be too stingy
nor too extravagant, right?

1395
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,250
- You should be moderate.
- Moderate.

1396
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,290
Our members are not moderate.

1397
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:01,790
There are about 3 or 4 people
who go all in.

1398
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,230
So I should just avoid the most
and the least amount?

1399
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,790
How about 1,000 dollars?

1400
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:08,400
Is it too much?

1401
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,810
I was going to say 10,000 dollars.
But it won't do.

1402
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,210
The cicadas are crying so loudly
all of a sudden.

1403
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,880
Ji Hyo, someone might write
10,000 dollars.

1404
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,210
(Se Chan starts raising the bet.)

1405
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,020
Ji Hyo,
it's the gangster special today.

1406
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,940
I'll buy a yacht
with the money today.

1407
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:28,150
Okay. Then I'll go all in too.

1408
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,060
How much did you write?

1409
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,460
I saw a lot of green
in the envelope.

1410
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,900
Yes, there's a lot.

1411
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,900
(He's testing the water first.)

1412
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,320
You know those uneducated guys
including Se Chan.

1413
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,960
Yes. There are uneducated guys.

1414
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,230
They will lose their mind
if they see it.

1415
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:43,770
(Haha avoids answering
by changing the topic.)

1416
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:47,630
I wrote just the right amount
by my standard.

1417
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,810
How much did you write?

1418
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,110
I should write
at least 1,000 dollars.

1419
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:55,590
- You say that, but you won't do it.
- Hey.

1420
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,290
Suk Jin, we should write
between 50 dollars and 100 dollars.

1421
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,130
- Really?
- To avoid the most and the least.

1422
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,650
Think mathematically.
Base multiplied by height divided by two.

1423
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,250
Do you not know it?

1424
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,790
What's that? It's so random.

1425
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,230
It's Pythagorean theorem.

1426
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,290
(Pythagorean proved
all sorts of theorems.)

1427
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,670
You ignorant punk.

1428
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,400
(Laughing)

1429
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,610
You're the master of mind games.

1430
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,540
You should be bold
when it comes to this.

1431
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,150
(Did he write a bold number
as he said with confidence?)

1432
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,210
This is just enough. Some guys
could write a few dollars.

1433
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,110
Dollars.

1434
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,480
Okay.

1435
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,210
It's enough.

1436
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:37,980
Which one should I choose?
Make a guess, ding-dong-dang

1437
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,460
I wrote 375 dollars.

1438
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,150
(Ji Hyo wants 375 dollars.)

1439
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,960
Someone must've written
a number bigger than 100.

1440
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,840
Those reckless guys
won't stay still.

1441
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,230
I'll go with 100 dollars.

1442
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,730
(They all submitted
the amount they want.)

1443
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,170
- All members wrote the amount. Yes.
- They did?

1444
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,480
Ji Hyo,

1445
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,210
you didn't write the most
nor the least amount.

1446
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:08,790
We'll give you cash as you wrote
as the basic mission fund.

1447
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:11,190
This is awesome.

1448
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,130
I got it right.

1449
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,570
Yes.

1450
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:18,730
You didn't write the most
nor the least amount.

1451
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,590
- Thank you.
- As your mission fund...

1452
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,130
Who wrote the least amount then?

1453
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,230
Did someone write a number
smaller than 100?

1454
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,500
(It means someone wrote more than
375 or less than 100.)

1455
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,880
This is incredible.

1456
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,150
(Everyone was given
their mission fund.)

1457
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,480
(Two of them are penniless.)

1458
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:39,320
All right. Three special guests
will call you as your captains.

1459
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,710
- And? Okay.
- You can call them if you know.

1460
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,020
Who is our captain today?

1461
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:46,290
You should tell me.

1462
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,190
- I think we're the main.
- Hello.

1463
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

1464
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,500
- Why is there no one?
- Hello.

1465
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,770
The captains don't have
mission funds.

1466
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:59,270
The captains will negotiate to
receive the fund and pick members.

1467
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,340
(The captains will negotiate to
receive the fund and pick members.)

1468
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,380
With this money?
No way. That's nonsense.

1469
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,880
It was so hard to get it.

1470
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,770
Each team will have three people
including the captain.

1471
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,480
The one who wasn't chosen
will make their own one-member team.

1472
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,820
A one-member team is nice.

1473
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,590
- But to carry out the mission...
- Is it a disadvantage? It's bad.

1474
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:21,230
When they call me, I should make
a deal by offering what I can give.

1475
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,130
Will Sae Ho appear? No, right?

1476
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,400
He isn't coming, is he? Be honest.

1477
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,960
It's not Sae Ho, right?

1478
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:28,770
Don't do that.

1479
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

1480
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,360
(Near Yeoui Island at that time)

1481
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,730
- Why is there no one?
- Hello.

1482
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

1483
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,380
(Super special guests appeared
walking slowly.)

1484
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,420
(Lee Yi Kyung, Ha Do Kwon,
Joo Woo Jae)

1485
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:41,670
(Familiar guys showed up awkwardly.)

1486
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,020
- What? Why is there no one?
- What's going on?

1487
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,650
- You don't see any members, do you?
- No.

1488
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:48,730
You'll become the captain
of each team today.

1489
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:49,820
(The 3 guests will become
the captain of each team.)

1490
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,130
You need members in your team
for the race.

1491
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,520
Recruit two Running Man members
you want...

1492
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,360
to form a three-member team.

1493
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,570
- The remaining member plays alone.
- Okay.

1494
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:03,170
Today, the more mission fund you have,
the more advantageous it is.

1495
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:07,670
The members received
the basic mission fund.

1496
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:11,110
Out of seven members, the ones
who wrote the most amount...

1497
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,770
- and the least amount got none.
- All right.

1498
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:17,650
But they will lie, saying
"I have this amount of money."

1499
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,820
"And I will give you this much."

1500
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,020
And those who received money
will negotiate with you.

1501
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,230
"I received this much and I'll give
you this much. Let's work together."

1502
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:31,860
So you must pick up
two trustworthy members...

1503
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:35,000
to come to the opening place.

1504
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,540
- We should pick them up?
- Yes.

1505
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,900
- You'll compete with one another.
- Okay.

1506
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,400
Let's go then.

1507
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,710
How can we get there?

1508
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,940
(He immediately
sets off by himself.)

1509
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,440
It's meaningless.

1510
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,840
- Why would you run when it's hot?
- I know.

1511
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,190
It's meaningless.

1512
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,710
Have you heard something
about today's guests?

1513
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,020
Isn't Woo Jae coming today?

1514
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,980
There will be Long Legs.

1515
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,060
(Jong Kook also knows
that Long Legs is coming.)

1516
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,520
The one from Anyang will come.

1517
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,270
(On the other hand, Se Chan
knows nothing about the guests.)

1518
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,440
- Se Chan.
- So Min, who are today's guests?

1519
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,360
I don't know either.

1520
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,940
So Min, you should text
your boyfriend quickly.

1521
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,810
- And ask who the guests are.
- My boyfriend?

1522
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,880
- It's one of the staff members, no?
- I don't have a boyfriend.

1523
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,110
All the staff members are married.
I don't have a boyfriend.

1524
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,770
I don't have one.

1525
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:21,540
I heard they're special guests.
It could be Sae Ho or Chang Hee.

1526
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,750
I actually said it.

1527
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,710
"If it's Sae Ho, I'll just go home."

1528
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,860
Do you see a drone?
Just tell me about it.

1529
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,380
Is there a drone over there?

1530
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,560
No, there isn't.

1531
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,000
I see one.

1532
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,560
- Really?
- Yes.

1533
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,630
(She bragged about a drone
and quickly hung up.)

1534
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:38,730
It's coming.

1535
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,130
(She's enjoying a drone solo shot
by herself.)

1536
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,770
(Come here.)

1537
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,380
It's fascinating.
I feel like it's looking at me.

1538
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:51,980
Follow me.

1539
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,210
(So Min is excited
to have a pet drone.)

1540
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:55,790
It's fascinating.
I think it's looking at me.

1541
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,540
It's looking at me.

1542
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:59,860
Go.

1543
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,920
(Moving)

1544
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,230
It's coming.

1545
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:08,000
(Frog loves everything
that pays attention to her.)

1546
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,090
It's fascinating.

1547
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,360
It looks like a big mosquito.

1548
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,940
It sounds like a big mosquito.

1549
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,730
(Captain Do Kwon looks serious.)

1550
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:23,880
(Analyzing painstakingly)

1551
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,440
(Do Kwon thought about it
for a long time.)

1552
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,650
Hello.

1553
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,360
We should actually cooperate later.

1554
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,650
- I don't want anything.
- Okay.

1555
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:41,020
I just want to see Jong Kook's fall.

1556
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,570
- Jong Kook's fall? Okay.
- Yes.

1557
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,670
I'll help you win.

1558
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,440
Can you make my dream come true?

1559
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,310
So do you want me not to accept
Jong Kook's offer?

1560
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,940
Pick him up, act like you'll accept him,
then ditch him at the end.

1561
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,520
- Just like that?
- Just ditch him with no mercy.

1562
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,980
- Hello, Yi Kyung.
- Yes, this is Yi Kyung.

1563
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,920
Let's pretend to recruit him
then ditch him.

1564
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,230
That's right.

1565
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,150
He needs to get hurt too.

1566
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,960
(Codename: Jong Kook's Fall,
which is Do Kwon's dream)

1567
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,440
Sure. Let's all ditch him
and make him play alone.

1568
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,070
- Yes, let's do that.
- Yes.

1569
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,170
(Jong Kook is waiting for a call,
not knowing anything about it.)

1570
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,230
I don't think Do Kwon would pick me.

1571
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:29,380
I bet he'll try to sabotage me.

1572
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,570
(Will Jong Kook be on his own
just as Do Kwon planned?)

1573
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:32,070
How come no one is calling me?

1574
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,710
(Meanwhile, So Min is waiting
for the team leaders to call her.)

1575
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:34,710
- Hey, So Min.
- Jong Kook.

1576
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,290
Do you know who today's guests are?

1577
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:37,590
The sly one.

1578
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,090
And we have a uselessly tall one.

1579
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,880
You mean Woo Jae?

1580
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,880
(Woo Jae?)

1581
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,960
- Woo Jae is joining us today?
- Yes.

1582
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,250
- Gosh, what about the other one?
- Why?

1583
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:51,900
I know just the two of them.
I don't know who the last one is.

1584
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:54,360
I think it's Yi Kyung.
He's calling me.

1585
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,170
It must be Yi Kyung.
He rarely calls me.

1586
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,710
Yi Kyung is calling you?

1587
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,880
- It must be Yi Kyung.
- Yi Kyung is our guest for today?

1588
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,540
Yes, he keeps calling me.

1589
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,670
I'll call you back
after talking to him.

1590
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,670
All right.

1591
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,110
So the last one was Yi Kyung.

1592
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,090
Wait a minute.
And he's not calling me?

1593
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,650
Why these little punks...

1594
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,360
(Team Leader Lee is contemplating
after excluding Jong Kook...)

1595
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,360
(just as they planned.)

1596
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,560
I'll try calling Suk Jin.
He's not on my list anyway.

1597
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,270
- Hey, Yi Kyung!
- Sorry! I pressed the wrong number!

1598
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:23,360
Yi Kyung...

1599
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,630
(Hanging up)

1600
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,900
Hey, Yi Kyung!

1601
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,860
So Yi Kyung is joining us today.

1602
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,880
(The first call from a team leader
ended as soon as it started.)

1603
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,170
(Persevering Suk Jin
is calling him again.)

1604
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,170
He's calling me back.

1605
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,380
- Suk Jin! What's up?
- Yi Kyung.

1606
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,540
Yi Kyung, you should join me.

1607
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,590
I prepared lots of money for you.

1608
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,340
You need money right now, don't you?

1609
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,880
I can give you 60 dollars.

1610
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,360
- You can give me 60 dollars?
- I can give you 60 dollars.

1611
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,630
How much do you have that you're
willing to give me 60 dollars?

1612
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,500
I have 80 dollars,
but I'm giving you 60 dollars.

1613
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,960
If you won't come to me,
I'll join someone else.

1614
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,090
Everyone wants me on their team
right now.

1615
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,900
Is that so?
Then you should join them.

1616
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,440
What?

1617
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,440
Then you should join them.

1618
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,270
- Hey.
- Yes?

1619
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:06,670
I'll give you 80 dollars.

1620
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,670
(I'll give you 80 dollars.)

1621
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:08,710
(Seok Sam is suddenly
offering every penny he has.)

1622
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,940
How much do you have that you're
willing to give me 80 dollars?

1623
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,610
I'm giving all the money I have.
I don't need any.

1624
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,880
But you said everyone wanted you.

1625
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,020
- They do.
- Yes?

1626
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,480
But they're asking for more.

1627
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,690
All right, then. Stay right there.

1628
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:25,020
- Okay.
- All right, Suk Jin.

1629
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,190
Does he take me as a fool?

1630
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,190
(The call ended without any gains.)

1631
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:30,860
Jae Suk is calling. Hey, Jae Suk.

1632
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,270
Suk Jin.
I heard you hit the jackpot.

1633
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,360
I heard that you did.
I didn't hit the jackpot.

1634
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,860
Hold on. Someone's calling me.
Hang up for now.

1635
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,440
Hey!

1636
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,440
(The shortest phone call)

1637
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,750
- Hey, Yi Kyung.
- Hey, Jae Suk!

1638
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,480
Where are you, Yi Kyung?

1639
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,570
So how much should I pay you
for you to come to me?

1640
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,610
I'll tell you honestly.

1641
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,460
- Please be honest.
- I'll be completely honest.

1642
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,320
I have exactly 300 dollars.

1643
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,190
- You have 300 dollars?
- Yes.

1644
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:57,750
How much are you willing to give me?

1645
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,500
I'll give you 100 dollars.

1646
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,090
(Laughing)

1647
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,270
(Yi Kyung only laughs
without giving him an answer.)

1648
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,460
- Okay?
- Just one-third?

1649
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,190
Fine. I'll give you 150 dollars.

1650
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,130
Let's settle with 150 dollars.

1651
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,630
Okay. I won't ask for more.
I'll take 180 dollars.

1652
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,710
- All right. Make that 150.
- No. Make that 180.

1653
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:16,770
Hey, you just cursed at me,
didn't you?

1654
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,980
No, I didn't.

1655
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,770
Why don't you hand me 180 dollars?

1656
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,190
You must know this.

1657
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,110
There are members
with no money at all.

1658
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,020
You'll be in trouble
if you join hands with them.

1659
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,880
All right.
Are you under Wonhyo Bridge?

1660
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,420
- Yes.
- I'll be there.

1661
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,060
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

1662
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,360
I must have Jae Suk on my team.

1663
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,730
(Meanwhile, Woo Jae
is calling Se Chan.)

1664
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:40,860
- Hey, Se Chan.
- My gosh, Mr. Joo.

1665
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,630
Why is it so hard to reach everyone?

1666
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,440
Because of the money
we got from the mission...

1667
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,770
Why is it so hard to reach you?

1668
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:50,540
- I heard about today's mission.
- Yes, sir.

1669
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,540
And this is the only time
I can act arrogant.

1670
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,150
(It looks like he decided
to enjoy this moment.)

1671
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:57,340
That's true.

1672
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,710
I have the right
to have the members...

1673
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,590
- get in the car.
- That's right.

1674
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:04,420
You're right. You can make
a few people suffer.

1675
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,900
- Mr. Joo.
- So...

1676
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,590
Don't use honorifics.

1677
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:08,860
Okay, fine.

1678
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,690
- Be real with me.
- Sure.

1679
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,730
I don't want to abuse my power
just because I'm a team leader.

1680
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,710
Sure. A vertical relationship
sounds great.

1681
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:17,810
It's a horizontal relationship,
not the vertical one.

1682
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,000
Isn't it called
vertical relationship?

1683
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,230
(Chuckling)

1684
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,770
(Getting a headache)

1685
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,250
How much did you ask for? Be honest.

1686
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,040
What do you mean?
I only have four dollars.

1687
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:30,480
Everyone else asked
for about a few dollars.

1688
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,290
They did that so they wouldn't
be in the last place.

1689
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,650
Woo Jae, hurry over.

1690
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,590
You just called, right?

1691
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,360
- Just come already. I'm hot.
- Where are you?

1692
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,690
Under Seogang Bridge.

1693
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,960
Can you take a photo of the bridge
and send it to me?

1694
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,290
My gosh. You're driving me crazy.

1695
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,270
Why are you doing this to me?

1696
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,540
I don't like the way you talk.

1697
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,570
(I don't like the way you talk.)

1698
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:54,270
That's because...
You must understand me.

1699
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,440
How much did you ask for?

1700
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,770
Gosh, I asked for 300 dollars.

1701
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,480
Then I'll just take 200 dollars.

1702
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:03,250
How can you take 200 dollars
when I have 300 dollars only?

1703
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,920
You must consider the fact...

1704
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,380
that you might end up with no one.

1705
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,380
Woo Jae.

1706
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,790
If you want to be on a team...

1707
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,000
(If you want to be on a team...)

1708
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,770
- Woo Jae.
- You should at least take me.

1709
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:17,500
You...

1710
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,900
Who taught you the basics
of variety shows?

1711
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,170
The members of Running Man.

1712
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,340
Can you send me a photo
of Wonhyo Bridge?

1713
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,610
My gosh, this is...

1714
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,770
Oh, my. Big Baby.

1715
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,650
Hey, Ji Hyo.

1716
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,980
Do Kwon, where are you?

1717
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,790
I'm on my way to meet you.
Where are you?

1718
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,380
Do Kwon, who are you considering...

1719
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,190
as your teammates?

1720
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:44,920
I'm thinking
of having you and Haha...

1721
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,360
on my team.

1722
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,960
- Haha?
- Yes.

1723
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,690
How about me and Jong Kook?

1724
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,860
(How about me and Jong Kook?)

1725
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:53,690
What do you think
of including Jong Kook?

1726
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,230
(Ji Hyo suggests including Jong Kook
whom Do Kwon was going to exclude.)

1727
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,570
You and Jong Kook?

1728
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,960
- What do you think of Jong Kook?
- I'd love to have him.

1729
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,130
Then you should...

1730
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,340
have Jong Kook on board first.
I'll be joining you for sure.

1731
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,380
You know me.

1732
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:05,820
- Of course.
- You know I'm the loyal type.

1733
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,380
- But I...
- I'll choose you for sure.

1734
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,290
I'll choose you too.
How much will you give me?

1735
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,090
I have plenty of money.

1736
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,820
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

1737
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,020
Gosh. Then how much do you have
and how much are you giving me?

1738
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,380
Come on, Do Kwon.
I'll give you half of it.

1739
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,400
Half of it?

1740
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,500
(Ji Hyo with 375 dollars
joins Do Kwon on her own.)

1741
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,000
- Thank you so much.
- It's no problem at all.

1742
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,730
Hurry up and come to me
with Jong Kook.

1743
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:25,840
All right.

1744
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,860
(He promised Ji Hyo to meet her
with Jong Kook.)

1745
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,960
Let's get going.
I'm going to pick Jong Kook up.

1746
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,880
Please go to the back gate
of the KBS building.

1747
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,810
(He sets off to pick up Jong Kook,
his target.)

1748
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:39,610
(His plan of isolating Jong Kook
is going smoothly.)

1749
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,170
Hey, Frog.

1750
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,210
- Jae Suk!
- What?

1751
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,980
Do you know today's guests?

1752
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,360
Of course I do.

1753
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,420
Can you tell me?
I know only two of them.

1754
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,980
- Must I share this with you?
- Yes.

1755
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,920
- It's Lee Yi Kyung.
- Okay.

1756
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,420
Joo Woo Jae and Cho Sae Ho.

1757
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,900
(Lee Yi Kyung, Joo Woo Jae,
and Cho Sae Ho?)

1758
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,130
(Lying about the guest lineup)

1759
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,360
It's Sae Ho?

1760
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,630
(Giggling)

1761
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,880
I'm going home.

1762
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,270
Why?

1763
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,270
Sae Ho doesn't have feelings
for you either.

1764
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,920
Tell him to stop coming
to our show, seriously.

1765
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,270
Why does he keep joining our show?

1766
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:16,380
Why not?

1767
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,710
Does he lobby
our producers or something?

1768
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,690
What are you talking about?

1769
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:24,590
Sae Ho is also very busy,
but he fixes his schedule...

1770
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,730
to join us when we ask him.

1771
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,560
Do you know Woo Jae's number?

1772
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,230
I do.

1773
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,730
Can you tell me?

1774
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,960
Why?

1775
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,540
Just because...

1776
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,900
(Just because...)

1777
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,070
Okay. Hold on. I'll tell you.

1778
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:40,840
- Okay.
- All right.

1779
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,500
I sent it to you.

1780
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,920
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1781
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,170
She thinks...

1782
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:49,820
(Chuckling)

1783
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,090
I gave her Sae Ho's number
instead of Woo Jae's.

1784
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:54,110
(I gave her Sae Ho's number
instead of Woo Jae's.)

1785
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,460
(Lying about Woo Jae's number)

1786
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,500
I changed the name to Joo Woo Jae.

1787
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,690
(He finds it hilarious.)

1788
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,460
(A perfect crime where
he even changed the saved name)

1789
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,590
My gosh.

1790
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,900
What? This is Sae Ho's number!

1791
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,900
(Sae Ho's number was passed
to her in disguise.)

1792
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,570
Jae Suk is so mean.

1793
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:09,900
I don't want to talk with him.

1794
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:12,630
He doesn't even want me.
Why must I call him first?

1795
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,380
It's...

1796
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,900
(Calling Team Leader Cho
who doesn't even want her)

1797
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,520
Jae Suk gave me Sae Ho's number
when I asked for Woo Jae's.

1798
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,940
- So...
- Sae Ho, I'll give you 30 dollars.

1799
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,520
- What?
- I'll give you 30 dollars.

1800
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,880
- Thirty dollars?
- Yes.

1801
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,020
Why would you give me 30 dollars?

1802
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,290
I'll give you 30 dollars.

1803
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,250
- You're giving me 30 dollars?
- Yes.

1804
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,250
Why?

1805
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:33,290
(Why are you giving me 30 dollars?)

1806
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:36,400
Well, that's how we team up
for today.

1807
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:38,320
- Today?
- Yes.

1808
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:39,840
- Why are you...
- What team?

1809
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,400
Why are you acting
like you're not today's guest?

1810
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:44,770
- What are you talking about?
- You're our guest for today.

1811
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,170
A guest for which show? Running Man?

1812
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,440
Yes. You're not our guest?

1813
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,570
- Out of nowhere?
- You're not our guest?

1814
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,770
No, I'm not.

1815
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,520
No, you are today's guest.
Don't you lie to me.

1816
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,980
Then let's do a video call.

1817
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,520
(She even video calls him.)

1818
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,520
You are our guest for the day.

1819
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,880
No, I'm not!

1820
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,420
Yes, you are!

1821
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,460
No, I'm not. I'm at home.

1822
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,500
Let me see. Turn the camera.
What? You're really home.

1823
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,730
What? You're not our guest
for today?

1824
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,360
- No, I'm not.
- But...

1825
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:15,570
But he said you're our guest.

1826
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,000
- Jae Suk did?
- Yes.

1827
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:19,730
But I'm not the guest.

1828
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,270
I'm sorry. Oh, gosh.
I'm sorry for this.

1829
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,750
It's all right. So Min.

1830
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,070
Isn't the Han River beautiful?

1831
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,610
Yes, it is,
but you're even more beautiful.

1832
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,520
(Yi Kyung has arrived somewhere.)

1833
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,790
Goodness.

1834
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:33,480
- Hey, Yi Kyung!
- Jae Suk.

1835
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,980
- Gosh, Yi Kyung.
- Jae Suk.

1836
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,360
Look at this.

59:58,429 --> 01:00:00,130
- Gosh.
- Would you like to listen?

1837
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,960
(It was Se Chan
who was calling Yi Kyung.)

1838
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,820
His caller ringtone is so old.
He's supposed to be a VIP guest.

1839
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,590
- Hey, Se Chan.
- Goodness. Yi Kyung.

1840
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:47,860
What brings you to call me?

1841
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,310
Your caller ringtone is so nice.
It's so refreshing.

1842
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,880
Se Chan, let me ask you directly.

1843
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,170
How much will you give him?

1844
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:57,070
I'll give you half of what I have.

1845
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,650
- All right.
- How much is that?

1846
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:00,880
I have 10 dollars. I'll give you 5.

1847
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,880
Jae Suk! Where did he go?

1848
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:08,020
(Se Chan was rejected right away
for offering a small sum.)

1849
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,790
- Jae Suk.
- Gosh. Hey, So Min.

1850
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,290
- Jae Suk.
- What is it?

1851
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:14,250
It wasn't him!

1852
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,250
What did you say?

1853
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,070
Sae Ho isn't today's guest!
I even video called him!

1854
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,460
(Sae Ho isn't today's guest!
I even video called him!)

1855
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,540
(The victim of Jae Suk's lie)

1856
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,540
Seriously. You're so naughty.

1857
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,860
(The victim of the fake guest case)

1858
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,210
Jae Suk.

1859
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:27,710
I called him and went, "30 dollars."

1860
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,500
He was like,
"What are you talking about?"

1861
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:32,110
Give me Woo Jae's number.

1862
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:34,070
- Woo Jae?
- Yes.

1863
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,650
Why do you keep singling out
Woo Jae?

1864
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:39,150
- That's because he is...
- All right. I will send it to you.

1865
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,480
someone I can recruit
with the smallest amount of money.

1866
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,690
All right.

1867
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:44,730
(He finally sends her
Woo Jae's number.)

1868
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:45,820
Okay.

1869
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,920
I will offer 100 dollars to Woo Jae.

1870
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,960
Please take a photo of me.

1871
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:55,230
(Suddenly apologetic)

1872
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:00,810
(After sending the photo,
she tries calling Woo Jae.)

1873
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,070
The number you have dialed
is not available.

1874
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,710
Come on, Woo Jae!

1875
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,380
(Captain Joo stays on the phone
for a long time.)

1876
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:07,650
Woo Jae!

1877
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,650
- Hey.
- Hello.

1878
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,710
Do you know...

1879
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,190
how long it took you to call me?

1880
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,460
I am disappointed
that you called me so late.

1881
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,900
The number you have dialed...

1882
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,670
I guess Woo Jae
is calling everyone...

1883
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:28,590
and figuring out
who he wants on his team.

1884
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,940
I should offer a lot of money.

1885
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,380
I should be honest.
I will call Yi Kyung.

1886
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:36,110
- Captain Lee.
- Hello.

1887
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:38,210
- Captain Lee.
- Yes?

1888
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:41,540
- I raised the price a bit.
- Okay.

1889
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,590
I can give you 120 dollars.

1890
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,840
I see that you lied to me.

1891
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,920
Yes. That's how things are
on Running Man.

1892
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,090
Be honest with me.
How much can you give me?

1893
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:53,420
I have 120 dollars.
I will give you all 120 dollars.

1894
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,460
We don't have much time left.

1895
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,960
- You will give me 120 dollars?
- Yes.

1896
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,440
Raise the price a bit more.
Call me after you are done thinking.

1897
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,810
(Captain Lee isn't easy.)

1898
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:04,860
This is my final offer!

1899
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,070
Raise the price a bit more.
Call me after you are done thinking.

1900
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,940
I have a lot of people lined up.

1901
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,270
Isn't 120 dollars enough?

1902
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,170
- Did you say 120 dollars?
- Yes.

1903
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,670
Give me a bit more.

1904
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,190
I will give you 150 dollars.

1905
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:17,940
- I will give you 150 dollars.
- You know,

1906
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,190
- money keeps coming out.
- Yes.

1907
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,250
I wonder how it keeps coming out.

1908
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,190
I need some money for myself.

1909
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:27,460
Then be honest and tell me
how much you have.

1910
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,500
Do Kwon is on his way here.

1911
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:31,960
- Really?
- He is on his way here.

1912
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,000
I bet 300 dollars on Do Kwon.

1913
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:35,900
You should go to him then.

1914
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,340
(Levelheaded)

1915
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,610
Why did you call me then?

1916
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:41,000
I was wondering
if you would like to come.

1917
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,110
- Suk Jin, join my team...
- He is too far.

1918
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,570
for 290 dollars.

1919
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,210
Did you say 290 dollars? Okay.

1920
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,750
- Join my team for 290 dollars.
- Okay.

1921
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,020
We have a deal. Okay.

1922
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,290
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay. 290 dollars. We are coming.

1923
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:52,750
- Okay. Hurry up.
- Let's go.

1924
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:53,790
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1925
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:55,690
Someone came.

1926
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:56,920
Who is inside?

1927
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,920
(Suk Jin is meeting someone
for the first time today.)

1928
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,190
- Suk Jin.
- What?

1929
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,590
- Hey.
- Suk Jin.

1930
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,070
What?

1931
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,670
- Suk Jin.
- Let's go.

1932
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:07,040
Give me 290 dollars.

1933
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,190
- I am supposed to do it later.
- Really?

1934
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,500
I am supposed to do it later.
Isn't that right?

1935
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,770
- Is it true?
- It's true.

1936
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,630
- I see.
- I have the money right here.

1937
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:15,110
Hey.

1938
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:17,070
- Okay.
- It looks like...

1939
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:19,170
you are calling so many people.

1940
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:20,420
You shouldn't be that way.

1941
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,650
Woo Jae, you punk.
You didn't give me a single call.

1942
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:24,150
I met up with Suk Jin.

1943
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:25,750
He is extremely angry...

1944
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,420
because you didn't give him
a single call.

1945
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,980
Yi Kyung, it's good to see you.

1946
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,690
Your shoulders became even broader.
Look at your arms.

1947
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:35,250
- I am always the same.
- You live diligently.

1948
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,070
- Get in the van.
- Gosh, I teamed up with Yi Kyung.

1949
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:39,500
- Suk Jin.
- How much did you agree to give?

1950
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,690
Forty dollars.

1951
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:42,840
- What did you say?
- Forty dollars.

1952
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:44,710
For goodness' sake.

1953
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:46,070
You agreed to give him 40 dollars.

1954
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:47,630
Will they be the members?

1955
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,230
- Have you decided?
- No.

1956
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:50,570
- Not yet.
- What?

1957
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:51,670
No.

1958
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,480
- No?
- Don't be like that.

1959
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,420
- I will get off.
- Not yet.

1960
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:57,610
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

1961
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:58,880
- Let's get off.
- This won't do. Let's get off.

1962
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,610
- Stay in the van.
- Hey.

1963
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,920
I will get off.

1964
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,480
Hold on. I will call Woo Jae.
I can't believe you.

1965
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:07,560
- Stay in the van.
- Decide if you want us as members.

1966
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,520
- Otherwise, we will leave.
- That's right.

1967
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,690
We aren't so easy.

1968
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,270
- We aren't so easy.
- We aren't so easy.

1969
01:08:12,270 --> 01:08:14,500
Do Kwon offered a spot
for 190 dollars.

1970
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,190
You should make a decision.

1971
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,170
- He keeps texting Do Kwon.
- What are you doing?

1972
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,770
- He keeps texting him.
- Suk Jin.

1973
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:23,500
Hurry up and tell us.
Should we get off or not?

1974
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,340
- He offered a spot for 190 dollars.
- That's right.

1975
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,070
That's 100 dollars less
than what we agreed on.

1976
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,540
If you make a decision,
I will stay in the car.

1977
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:31,420
- Woo Jae.
- Take the 2 of us for 330 dollars.

1978
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:34,320
- Take the 2 of us for 330 dollars.
- Make up your mind.

1979
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,880
- They will be my teammates.
- Okay.

1980
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,060
There you go.

1981
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:39,190
(After some deliberation,
he makes up his mind.)

1982
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,900
Sir, please pull over for a second.

1983
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,070
We agreed on 40 dollars, right?

1984
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:44,690
- The total is 340 dollars.
- Give me 50 dollars.

1985
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,090
- I will give you 50 dollars.
- Okay.

1986
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:47,590
So the prices are
50 dollars and 290 dollars.

1987
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,960
Why is it so different for me? Hey.

1988
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:51,540
- I am satisfied with this team.
- Of course.

1989
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:54,170
- You got the ace members.
- You know...

1990
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,810
How could you say that?

1991
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,040
You got the ace members.

1992
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,940
- How...
- I got fathers.

1993
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:01,980
(Not ace members, but fathers)

1994
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,210
- Yi Kyung.
- Yes?

1995
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:05,650
I really am an ace member.
You know that, right?

1996
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,880
I am incredible
at races and other things.

1997
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,020
- I am good at everything.
- Really?

1998
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,190
- That's right. But...
- That's right. Hey.

1999
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,730
I am plus and Suk Jin is minus.

2000
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:15,960
So together, we are zero.

2001
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,820
- It's zero-sum.
- Yes.

2002
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,630
That's not true.
Quizzes are my specialty.

2003
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:21,940
As for Suk Jin,

2004
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,810
I can see him grow weaker each year.

2005
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,270
(I can see him grow weaker
each year.)

2006
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:27,130
- Each year.
- Each year.

2007
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,980
- You feel it too.
- Of course I do.

2008
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:31,310
It's not like we need to wear
a team uniform.

2009
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,670
Why are the two of you wearing
a vest?

2010
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,650
Did you wear a vest to be the best?

2011
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:35,770
(Laughing)

2012
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,250
- Is that it?
- We have a connection.

2013
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,790
I really missed you, Suk Jin.

2014
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:42,520
I missed you too.

2015
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,920
Jong Kook and I had a fight
in the morning.

2016
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,790
- We had a fight.
- I see.

2017
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,320
I called him "Muscle Man."

2018
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:51,090
- Muscle Man.
- Muscle Man.

2019
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,290
He doesn't suit your style.

2020
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,570
Jong Kook doesn't suit your style.

2021
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,400
- That's the thing with Jong Kook.
- You should give him a hard time.

2022
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,540
Jong Kook terrorizes
the members of the soccer club.

2023
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,900
- You play soccer with him.
- You are a member.

2024
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,070
- I quit because of Jong Kook.
- I see.

2025
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,900
I became mentally drained
whenever I play soccer with him.

2026
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,940
(He hated it.)

2027
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:10,020
- "Yi Kyung, don't play like that."
- Seriously.

2028
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,710
- He is bad at it too.
- His soccer skills are the worst.

2029
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,610
- Why is he so critical?
- He thinks...

2030
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:16,520
- he is a world-class soccer player.
- That's insane.

2031
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,520
He is a bit better than me.

2032
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,060
Is he here?

2033
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:23,270
(Jong Kook meets up with someone.)

2034
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:25,520
Hold on. Let me make a call.

2035
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,090
Come on. I am going to leave.

2036
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,570
- Hello.
- I am hanging up.

2037
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,670
See? I hung up right away.

2038
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,070
I said, "I am hanging up."

2039
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:34,730
- Let me check one last time.
- Okay.

2040
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,310
- How much do you have?
- Hey.

2041
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,310
- Is money that important?
- No, it isn't.

2042
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:39,750
- But I need to know the amount.
- I will give you 40 percent.

2043
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,380
- And how much is that?
- It's 20 dollars.

2044
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:42,710
(It's 20 dollars.)

2045
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:45,610
Why are you laughing?

2046
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,880
Is that amount laughable?

2047
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:52,320
- Get in the van then.
- Really?

2048
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:53,960
Would you be okay with 20 dollars?

2049
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,590
- You will get Ji Hyo, right?
- Yes.

2050
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:59,020
That's a bit burdensome.

2051
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,070
- Okay. I will get in the van.
- Get in the van.

2052
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,940
I am touched that you accepted me
for 20 dollars.

2053
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:11,110
(Do Kwon's dream
from the beginning of the shoot)

2054
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:14,270
(Jong Kook's fall)

2055
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:18,110
(Act like you'll accept him,
then ditch him at the end.)

2056
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:22,320
(It's Do Kwon's plan
to make him the remaining member.)

2057
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:26,860
- As far as I know, Ji Hyo is rich.
- Are you certain?

2058
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,730
- I don't know the exact amount.
- I don't know about her.

2059
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:30,860
- She is strange these days.
- She didn't give me the amount.

2060
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,420
You should ask her
to give you the exact amount.

2061
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:34,770
Whose van is that?
Isn't that Jong Kook's van?

2062
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:41,040
(She spots Jong Kook's van
and runs over.)

2063
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,000
Jong Kook.

2064
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,770
- Ji Hyo.
- There she is. What is she doing?

2065
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:48,770
- She doesn't know that we are here.
- For now...

2066
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,210
(Ji Hyo's appearance
makes them flustered.)

2067
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:55,190
Hey, why is she coming?

2068
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:56,490
- She is coming.
- Lock the door.

2069
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:58,730
Did you lock the door?

2070
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:00,950
(The door opens.)

2071
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:03,570
(Averting his eyes)

2072
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,790
What are you doing?

2073
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,490
What are you doing?

2074
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:08,330
- Why didn't you come to me?
- Ji Hyo.

2075
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:10,160
- Do Kwon, you...
- I was just about to call you.

2076
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,700
- Now...
- I was about to press the button.

2077
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:13,870
You weren't going
to let me into the van, right?

2078
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:15,500
You can't hop in yet.

2079
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,540
You have to make a deal first.

2080
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,580
- I will make a deal.
- Let's talk here.

2081
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,780
How much do you have?

2082
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,780
Should I say it
in front of Jong Kook?

2083
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,490
It's okay. We are a team.

2084
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,990
We aren't a team...

2085
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:27,910
- just yet.
- I will talk to her outside.

2086
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:30,690
- You shouldn't get off.
- I will be back.

2087
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:33,250
- Fine. Go ahead.
- I can't talk in front of you.

2088
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:36,120
- Ji Hyo.
- I will give you 100 dollars.

2089
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,770
You told me
to let Jong Kook in the van,

2090
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,920
although I didn't want to.

2091
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,740
I will give you 100 dollars.
I promise.

2092
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,370
I made a promise.
I will give you that money.

2093
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:47,910
- Get in the van.
- All right.

2094
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,410
(Ji Hyo becomes a member
for 100 dollars.)

2095
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:50,450
- Get in the van.
- All right.

2096
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:51,650
- Did you strike a deal?
- Jong Kook.

2097
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,340
Why didn't you answer the phone?

2098
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,020
What are you saying?
I will move to the back.

2099
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,020
No. I will move to the back.

2100
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,240
It's okay.

2101
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,650
- I...
- Did you strike a deal?

2102
01:12:58,710 --> 01:12:59,990
- Yes.
- Really?

2103
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:02,620
Why did the two of you try
to keep me out of the van?

2104
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,750
When did I do that?

2105
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,280
- I am disappointed.
- I did no such thing.

2106
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,950
- Why did you try to keep me out?
- I did no such thing.

2107
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,420
When does it end?

2108
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,330
It's okay to make a selection now.

2109
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:14,160
Hold on.

2110
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:15,790
Why is Se Chan calling me?

2111
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,830
- Se Chan called me too.
- Really?

2112
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,130
- I think...
- He must be anxious.

2113
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,480
he became the remaining member.

2114
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,280
Yi Kyung called me too.

2115
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,080
(He begins to have a meal
in a carefree manner.)

2116
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,620
Do Kwon is loyal.

2117
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:29,540
You know that I am loyal too, right?

2118
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,520
Of course I do.

2119
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,520
There is another one.

2120
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,860
There it is.

2121
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,230
This one is tasty.
Cranberry and chicken.

2122
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,120
- It's great.
- The team members are relaxed.

2123
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:43,120
As a captain, I have many worries
and internal struggles.

2124
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:44,960
I have so many internal struggles.

2125
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:47,570
Do Kwon, relax.

2126
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,070
I was so busy worrying
that I didn't eat anything.

2127
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:51,270
(Eating)

2128
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,910
(Staring)

2129
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:54,700
I am eating this much
even though I had breakfast.

2130
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,440
Now that I am seeing your face...

2131
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,650
- and seeing you eat well...
- Right?

2132
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:00,620
- Yes. It's nice.
- You know,

2133
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:02,280
I got everything I wanted
from this van.

2134
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,490
I got sandwiches. I got to eat.

2135
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:07,880
Do Kwon, will you finalize
the team members now?

2136
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,730
Do Kwon, will you finalize
the team members now?

2137
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:12,730
(Eating)

2138
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:15,290
- Me?
- No. Do Kwon.

2139
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:17,290
- Why...
- Do Kwon.

2140
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,490
(What will be his decision?)

2141
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,770
Yes.

2142
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:21,940
(Team Do Kwon has been decided.)

2143
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:23,270
Do Kwon is great.

2144
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:27,000
- Why did you scare us like that?
- He had to finalize his decision.

2145
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,480
- That's right.
- Do Kwon.

2146
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:33,040
You can relax.
You are on Running Man.

2147
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,820
- It's okay.
- The weather is hot,

2148
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,540
so you should eat at a cool place.

2149
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,820
You shouldn't eat sloppily outside
since you are a celebrity.

2150
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:46,060
What is he going to do?
He doesn't know...

2151
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,200
that he will get backstabbed.

2152
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,620
(He worries about another
without knowing his own fate.)

2153
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,900
(He is the only captain
with 0 team members.)

2154
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,770
Whose number is this?

2155
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:58,030
Hello?

2156
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,960
Is it you, So Min?

2157
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,370
Is it you, So Min?

2158
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:02,530
Woo Jae!

2159
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,280
I will give you 50 dollars.

2160
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,500
"I will give you 50 dollars?"

2161
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:10,150
I don't have much money,
so 50 dollars is a lot.

2162
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:12,820
Please know my sincerity.
I have 200 dollars.

2163
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,210
I will give you 50...
No, I will give you 100 dollars.

2164
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,380
- You will give me 100 dollars?
- I will do anything.

2165
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,330
Shall people who were born in 1986
team up today?

2166
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,290
Of course!

2167
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:26,590
Hey. Roar!

2168
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:29,370
I promised you the highest amount.

2169
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,870
- So Min.
- I might give you more.

2170
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:35,110
I will call you
right after I do something.

2171
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,500
Make sure you call me.
I am under Wonhyo Bridge.

2172
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:38,950
Okay.

2173
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,880
(Someone comes to Haha.)

2174
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,860
(The person inside the van is...)

2175
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,020
All right.

2176
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,530
(Woo Jae?)

2177
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:53,950
Who were you talking to
on the phone?

2178
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:57,270
If you tell me honestly
how much money you have,

2179
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,460
I will go to you
with pure intentions.

2180
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:02,960
- I will be honest since it's you.
- Okay.

2181
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:05,270
It's under 700 dollars.

2182
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:08,000
- Under 700 dollars?
- Yes.

2183
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,030
(Intrigued)

2184
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:10,500
- Woo Jae.
- Really?

2185
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,870
Just come here.

2186
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:13,200
- I am hot.
- Where are you?

2187
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,370
I am under Seogang Bridge.

2188
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,540
Haha.

2189
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:19,880
Come over here.

2190
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:20,990
What?

2191
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,580
Get off the van for a second.

2192
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:25,950
- What?
- I prepared a party for you.

2193
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:27,750
- Who is it?
- Let's go to the shade.

2194
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,490
Hey.

2195
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:30,960
- My goodness.
- Come here.

2196
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,330
It's good to see you.

2197
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:34,870
- See?
- I was on my way.

2198
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:36,870
Come on. We should be a team.

2199
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:39,810
I was on my way to you.
But I had to meet Haha first.

2200
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,110
- Haha. Okay.
- Okay.

2201
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:43,280
I can't see you much
even though you are on the show.

2202
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:45,150
You haven't gotten a sense
of the situation, have you?

2203
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,820
We should be a team.

2204
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,480
This is the best combination.

2205
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:51,740
Don't pick So Min. She has no money.

2206
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,120
So Min isn't the only one.
Jae Suk has no money either.

2207
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,210
Jae Suk has no money.

2208
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:59,380
- If you recruit us, you will win.
- You will win.

2209
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:01,090
- We will help you win.
- Do you know why?

2210
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,330
I have the most amount of money.

2211
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,090
How much will you give him?

2212
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:08,830
Yi Kyung offered me a spot
for ten dollars.

2213
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:10,460
He is on his way here.

2214
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,700
Since it's you,
I will give you 20 dollars.

2215
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:14,630
- Do you know what he said to me?
- What did he say?

2216
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,200
I asked him to tell me honestly
how much money he has...

2217
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:19,000
and he said, "Under 700 dollars."

2218
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,980
Nonsense. That's nonsense.

2219
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:22,840
- Seriously.
- I have under 600 dollars.

2220
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,490
I have under 500 dollars.

2221
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:25,840
Is that how it's going to be?

2222
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,750
- Do you know what he said?
- I have no money.

2223
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,190
He told me that he has four dollars.

2224
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,160
He told me that he has four dollars.

2225
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,230
One said 700 dollars
and the other said 4 dollars.

2226
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,270
Who am I supposed to listen to?

2227
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,960
I have no money.

2228
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:41,160
- But...
- Four dollars is a lie.

2229
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:45,570
Who am I supposed to listen to?
What's the standard?

2230
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,500
He is a liar.

2231
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,480
That was just wrong.
You need to apologize.

2232
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,200
- I will apologize.
- Apologize.

2233
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,040
I will apologize. I will pay you
the same amount as Haha.

2234
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:56,040
Let's hurry up and go.

2235
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,380
You could get messed up.

2236
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:59,280
You could get two members
with zero dollars.

2237
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:01,820
Let's go to the van.

2238
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,580
Make a decision.

2239
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:06,330
We have people coming here.
We are busy.

2240
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,490
- I am confused about the amount.
- You will have 40 dollars.

2241
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:13,090
- He mentioned the highest amount...
- This is driving me crazy.

2242
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,830
How much do you have?

2243
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,570
Don't you think
"under 700 dollars" was too much?

2244
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:19,000
It was too much. Don't you think
"four dollars" was too much?

2245
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,700
I can't believe
you offered him a dollar.

2246
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:24,240
It's no wonder
he doesn't believe me.

2247
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,710
- I don't have much money.
- Let's get in his van.

2248
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:29,320
Haha, I don't have much money.

2249
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,990
Woo Jae, what are you going to do?

2250
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,080
Woo Jae, are you leaving?

2251
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,280
- So Min.
- I will give you 200 dollars.

2252
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,230
- Woo Jae.
- So Min.

2253
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:38,660
(I will give you 200 dollars.)

2254
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,290
I will give you 200 dollars.
Did you see the photo I sent you?

2255
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:42,660
You will give me 200 dollars?

2256
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:43,700
(So Min offers 200 dollars.)

2257
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,120
It makes no sense.

2258
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,370
My feelings are so hurt.
I will give you 200 dollars.

2259
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,330
I will give you a bit more
on top of it.

2260
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,980
Do you have 200 dollars?

2261
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:57,580
Yes. I will give you 200 dollars.

2262
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,650
Okay.

2263
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,840
- Really? Please let me join.
- Give me 200 dollars.

2264
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,950
Which member did you recruit?

2265
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,450
I don't have anyone yet.

2266
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,580
The spots are empty.

2267
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:09,520
Stay there, So Min.

2268
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,620
Branch One, Yeoui Island, Han River.

2269
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,830
- That's nonsense.
- Hey.

2270
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,990
- She doesn't have that money.
- I swear she doesn't have it.

2271
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:18,420
- Seriously.
- So...

2272
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,160
how much will you give me?

2273
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:23,810
- You know...
- I am in a bad mood now.

2274
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:26,940
I supported you
from the very beginning, right?

2275
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,980
You should be compensated then.

2276
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:30,840
What should he do?

2277
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,780
Woo Jae.

2278
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,650
(Woo Jae grimaces.)

2279
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,870
Your facial expression was so funny.

2280
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:38,650
- The two of us have money.
- We have money.

2281
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:41,580
Please go to
Branch One, Yeoui Island, Han River.

2282
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:42,580
(He moves to So Min's location.)

2283
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,450
Woo Jae!

2284
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,900
Woo Jae!

2285
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,090
Woo Jae!

2286
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,330
(Running at full speed)

2287
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,700
Woo Jae!

2288
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:57,610
Joo Woo Jae!

2289
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:58,870
Hello.

2290
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:00,810
- Come here.
- I will work hard.

2291
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,580
- Why is your face so puffy today?
- It's good to see you.

2292
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,200
- It's good to see you.
- I will give you 200 dollars.

2293
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,120
- How much do you have?
- I will give you 200 dollars.

2294
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:09,480
- For real...
- You know,

2295
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,880
it's hard to believe your words.

2296
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,880
I have to give you money
for real, so I can't lie.

2297
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:17,830
I will give you 200 dollars
for real.

2298
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:20,660
If you have zero dollars,
you can lie.

2299
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:21,950
I have money.

2300
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,460
- Listen.
- No one else will give you so much.

2301
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:26,570
- Of course not.
- And Haha...

2302
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:28,630
You are offering much money
than the others.

2303
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:30,410
I must have a lot of money then.

2304
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,630
I will give you 200 dollars.

2305
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:35,830
I have to team up with you.
Otherwise, I will be alone.

2306
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:40,820
So Min has no choice but to beg.

2307
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,780
That's right.
She needs to get in the van.

2308
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:46,880
- What's going on?
- Hello.

2309
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,380
Did you pick the members?

2310
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,910
No, not yet.

2311
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:51,490
So Min, get in the van.

2312
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,590
All right.
How much will you give me?

2313
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:55,660
Say it openly.

2314
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,830
I will give you 200 dollars.

2315
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,700
Nonsense.

2316
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,770
Trust me this once.

2317
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,030
How much will you give me?

2318
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:03,700
- What I offered earlier.
- Same here.

2319
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:06,570
- Seriously, I...
- Her offer makes no sense.

2320
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,610
So Min, your offer makes no sense.

2321
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,700
- You chose the wrong amount.
- It makes no sense.

2322
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,650
- It's too much.
- I am not joking. It's true.

2323
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:25,820
(During the money distribution)

2324
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:28,410
Your amount wasn't
the highest or the lowest,

2325
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:34,230
so you will receive 470 dollars.

2326
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:35,230
(So Min acquired 470 dollars.)

2327
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:36,730
Whose amount was the highest?

2328
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:38,790
- Is it a secret?
- It's a secret.

2329
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,030
(She meant it
when she offered 200 dollars!)

2330
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:42,090
What will I do
if everyone has more money than me?

2331
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,570
Trust me this once.
I will give you 200 dollars.

2332
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:50,110
Had you offered 50 or 60 dollars,
I would have believed you.

2333
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:54,240
- It's true. Trust me this once.
- I think 200 dollars is too much.

2334
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,580
But it's true.

2335
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,870
Hurry up, Woo Jae.

2336
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:00,040
Will you choose me
as your teammate or not?

2337
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,210
- Answer that.
- I am not joking. It's true.

2338
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:03,580
I will make a realistic decision.

2339
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:04,920
It's true, Woo Jae.

2340
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,950
Then...

2341
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:07,860
- Just say it.
- Relax and say it.

2342
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:09,790
- We are professionals.
- I am leaving then.

2343
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:12,090
Know that I offered 200 dollars.

2344
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:14,570
I am leaving.
Know that I offered 200 dollars.

2345
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:15,830
- Hey.
- Hold on, So Min.

2346
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,870
- I wasn't joking about the amount.
- She is sullen.

2347
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:19,410
- I offered 200 dollars.
- Don't be sullen.

2348
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:21,130
- I am confident.
- His decision isn't final.

2349
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:24,080
I am confident.
Make up your mind however you want.

2350
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:25,910
(Slamming)

2351
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:28,120
- She is sullen.
- Why is she sullen?

2352
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,080
- Why is she sullen?
- Why is she sullen? My goodness.

2353
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,410
- Let's go.
- I will go with them.

2354
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:33,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

2355
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,120
Should we give him the money now
or at the location?

2356
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,780
- At the location.
- Okay.

2357
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:40,330
It's so stupid
that he doesn't believe me.

2358
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,700
He doesn't believe me.

2359
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,750
I have so much money.

2360
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,370
Seriously. I will be alone today.

2361
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:47,870
Let's go.

2362
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:51,030
Did no one else come?
Are we the only ones?

2363
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:52,030
(It's time for the four teams
to gather around.)

2364
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:54,870
It's cool in here.
The waiting room was hot.

2365
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:57,000
- Hello.
- There you are, So Min.

2366
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,040
You came alone.

2367
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,280
I am alone today.

2368
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,340
- Hello.
- Have you been well?

2369
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,340
- You are alone.
- So Min, you...

2370
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:04,480
I am alone today.

2371
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:06,340
I am alone today.

2372
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:08,120
So Min is sullen. That's scary.

2373
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,020
Watch how I behave today.

2374
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,580
Did people arrive already?

2375
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,400
- Okay.
- Do Kwon.

2376
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,450
All right.

2377
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,230
- So Min, you are alone.
- Are you guys a team?

2378
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:21,740
This happened because someone
who looks like a lizard rolled in.

2379
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:22,870
Hello.

2380
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:23,990
- Hey.
- Hello.

2381
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:25,740
- Hey, Woo Jae.
- Hey.

2382
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,770
- Hey, Woo Jae. Come here.
- I have a lot of money.

2383
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:30,000
You never give me a call.

2384
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,280
- I don't have your number.
- I gave you his number.

2385
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,080
- Seriously, you...
- He gave me the number,

2386
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,780
so I called it, and it was his dad.

2387
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:38,820
Why did you do such a thing?

2388
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,710
You're unbelievable. Hey, you...

2389
01:23:40,710 --> 01:23:42,560
It was just ridiculous.

2390
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,360
Why did you do that?

2391
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,780
- He's funny.
- That doesn't make sense.

2392
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,450
My dad is retired,
so he's bored now.

2393
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:48,560
- My goodness.
- You should call him.

2394
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,160
- He's such a lunatic.
- He's crazy.

2395
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,900
Why did you send him
your dad's number?

2396
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:55,740
Hey, Yi Kyung. You... Listen.

2397
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:57,990
He's a member of my soccer team,

2398
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:00,160
- but he rarely comes.
- Right.

2399
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,780
- Because I'm busy.
- He doesn't come.

2400
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:03,740
- I'm busy.
- How dare you... Hang on.

2401
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,080
- That's because of you.
- Listen to me.

2402
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:08,340
He rarely comes. And our team
recently got a new uniform.

2403
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:10,580
He wants the uniform number seven.

2404
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:14,020
- Is he out of his mind?
- Even I couldn't ask for that.

2405
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:15,490
- I just want the number.
- I mean...

2406
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:17,450
- What's wrong with that?
- Number seven...

2407
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:18,990
- I understand why you're upset.
- I know.

2408
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:20,780
- That sounds upsetting.
- By the way,

2409
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:22,090
aren't you Jong Kook's enemy?

2410
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,450
Actually, I had plans.

2411
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:25,370
- Do Kwon.
- He said he'd betray you.

2412
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:27,990
Actually, I was
going to kick him out.

2413
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:30,770
But as soon as he got in,
like a giant baby, he kept eating.

2414
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:33,530
He ate sandwiches
and kept spilling things.

2415
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:35,940
- I kept sighing, so...
- That's because...

2416
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,740
he said, "You can kick me out
if you want." But he kept on eating.

2417
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:41,110
I got my money's worth in the car.

2418
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:42,840
By eating.

2419
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,190
- I had enough.
- He kept eating.

2420
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:46,780
All right.
I will announce the amounts.

2421
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:47,880
You should tell us.

2422
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:50,990
First, I will announce the amounts
offered to the captains.

2423
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:52,080
- The money for the captains.
- Yes.

2424
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,280
This team...

2425
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,490
- Is he going to be rich?
- He got a lot.

2426
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:56,990
- Haha offered 25 dollars.
- It's 25 dollars.

2427
01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:58,570
And Se Chan also offered 25 dollars.

2428
01:24:58,570 --> 01:24:59,870
- We offered 25 dollars each.
- It's 50 dollars.

2429
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:01,370
- Hey, you said three dollars.
- Hey.

2430
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:03,530
- You offered me three dollars.
- You should've called me.

2431
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:04,810
I deceived you.

2432
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:06,200
Team Ha Do Kwon.

2433
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:09,200
Jong Kook offered 20 dollars,
and Ji Hyo offered 100 dollars.

2434
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,950
- She offered 100 dollars?
- So it's 120 dollars in total.

2435
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:13,580
(Do Kwon is offered 120 dollars.)

2436
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,580
How much is he getting?

2437
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:16,170
How much did you guys offer?

2438
01:25:16,170 --> 01:25:17,950
Jae Suk offered 50 dollars.

2439
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:19,020
- It's 50 dollars.
- He offered 50 dollars.

2440
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,910
And Suk Jin offered 290 dollars.

2441
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:22,190
- He offered 290 dollars.
- What?

2442
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,750
(50 dollars from Yoo Jae Suk,
290 dollars from Ji Suk Jin)

2443
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,380
So he's offered
340 dollars in total.

2444
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,330
And So Min is a one-member team.

2445
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:30,360
I'll announce
the amount So Min owns.

2446
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,790
- How much is it?
- Zero dollars?

2447
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,990
The money So Min got is...

2448
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:35,330
The money she owns now.

2449
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:37,660
(So Min's mission fund is...)

2450
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:38,870
It's 470 dollars.

2451
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:42,110
(470 dollars)

2452
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,170
(Shaky eyes)

2453
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:46,740
You should've
offered more money then.

2454
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:48,210
She has a lot of money.

2455
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:49,280
- She's rich.
- She has 470 dollars?

2456
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,170
- I offered 200 dollars.
- So she lost the money.

2457
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:52,710
- No.
- No, she got the money.

2458
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:53,990
She received the money.

2459
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:54,990
She didn't lose the money.

2460
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:56,910
I said I'd give you 200 dollars.

2461
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:58,450
(I'm doomed.)

2462
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,030
So Min, you have the guts.

2463
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:03,700
And I will announce the amount
Ha Do Kwon will receive.

2464
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:05,730
He will receive 120 dollars.

2465
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:06,920
(He will receive the amount
he was offered.)

2466
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,660
(Ha Do Kwon gets 120 dollars.)

2467
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:09,940
That's perfect.

2468
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:11,460
- I see.
- Look at him.

2469
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:15,200
And Lee Yi Kyung was
offered 340 dollars.

2470
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,700
- Yes.
- That's right.

2471
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,000
- And he will receive...
- How much is it?

2472
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
(And he will receive...)

2473
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
zero dollars.

2474
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:23,480
- What?
- Zero dollars.

2475
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,650
(Suk Jin and Jae Suk
got 0 dollars.)

2476
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:28,490
(Yi Kyung's team members,
Suk Jin and Jae Suk are broke.)

2477
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,080
This is great.

2478
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,360
My goodness.

2479
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:34,580
I want 732 dollars.

2480
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:35,590
(Suk Jin wrote 732 dollars.)

2481
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:36,590
(He bid the highest amount.)

2482
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:38,700
What? Yes.

2483
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:42,370
You wrote the highest amount.

2484
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:45,070
So you get zero dollars
for your mission fund.

2485
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,530
I thought I'd get the money.

2486
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,940
This is a moderate amount.

2487
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,670
Okay.

2488
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,280
All right. Jae Suk.

2489
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,690
You wrote the lowest amount.

2490
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,690
So you get zero dollars.

2491
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:04,780
(You too?)

2492
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,830
(Me too!)

2493
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:07,860
This is great.

2494
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,400
- That was so close.
- This is amazing.

2495
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,790
Hey, you should be happy.

2496
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:12,330
- This is how things go here.
- It's all right.

2497
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:14,270
- This is Running Man.
- Right. Don't cry.

2498
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:15,940
Gosh, they got me.

2499
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:18,370
I got fooled.

2500
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,910
You took him in.

2501
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,670
She has the most money.

2502
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:22,940
I offered you 150 dollars.

2503
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,830
I picked the members
with the highest and lowest amounts.

2504
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:27,650
(How much can they
give up for money?)

2505
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:28,820
(Ma'am.)

2506
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:29,980
(Step 1, power)

2507
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,580
(Step 2)

2508
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,690
(Pride)

2509
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,020
- My gosh.
- Okay.

2510
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:35,060
(Step 3)

2511
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,190
(Dignity)

2512
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,450
(Or...)

2513
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:39,950
Hey.

2514
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:41,490
(Something more...)

2515
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,790
(If you want money,)

2516
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:46,160
(don't miss out on a chance.)

2517
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,960
(Growl)

2518
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,490
- No mercy.
- Do Kwon.

2519
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,830
(The three captains who are here
to upset the established order.)

2520
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:52,960
(You should pick Jae Suk.)

2521
