1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,640
Before we start,

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,650
we'll give you...

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,980
- a mission fund as you want. - Really?

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,650
We'll give you what you wrote.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,190
But if you wrote the most or the least amount, you won't get it.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,950
You should think about what others would've written.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,420
- This means something. April 7. - I wrote 375 dollars.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,360
I wrote 205 dollars.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,630
- I wrote 100 dollars. - I wrote 93 dollars.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,330
I want 732 dollars.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,800
This is a moderate amount. I think 80 dollars is enough.

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,110
- Okay. - You wrote the highest amount.

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,810
Jae Suk. You wrote the lowest amount.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,810
So you get zero dollars.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,310
- You will start with zero amount. - I knew it.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,780
- It's Yi Kyung. - Woo Jae is coming.

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,150
Sorry! I pressed the wrong number!

18
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,550
If you don't choose us, we will get off now.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,620
- I choose them. - Okay.

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,260
I just want to see Jong Kook's fall.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,260
Do Kwon, will you finalize the team members now?

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,230
Yes.

23
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,170
- It's okay. - The weather is hot,

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,840
so you should eat at a cool place.

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,170
- Say it openly. - I will give you 200 dollars.

26
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,640
- Nonsense. - I'm leaving then.

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,150
Know that I offered 200 dollars.

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,020
I am leaving. Know that I offered 200 dollars.

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,350
I'm not kidding. It really is 200 dollars.

30
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,050
I'll announce
the amount So Min owns.

31
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,490
- How much is it?
- Zero dollars?"

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
It's 470 dollars.

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,160
(As much as 470 dollars)

34
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
It's 470 dollars.

35
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
(Her huge offer was true.)

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
You should've
offered more money then.

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,260
She has 470 dollars?

38
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,460
And Lee Yi Kyung was
offered 340 dollars.

39
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,590
- Yes.
- That's right.

40
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,100
- And he will receive...
- How much is it?

41
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,870
Zero dollars.

42
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,910
Zero dollars.

43
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,730
- It's these two.
- This is great.

44
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,410
- That was so close.
- This is amazing.

45
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,140
Hey, you should be happy.

46
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,610
- This is how things go here.
- It's all right.

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,020
- Gosh, they got me.
- It's just like that.

48
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,490
I got fooled.

49
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,580
You took him in.

50
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,430
She has the most money.

51
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,890
I offered you 150 dollars.

52
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,460
- So Min is the richest.
- Yes. She has the most money.

53
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,600
- So Min is the winner.
- But I...

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,070
- So Min, you're the winner.
- The weak link is the winner.

55
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,500
- So Min.
- The sole winner.

56
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,670
So Min is the winner.

57
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,960
Get lost.

58
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,240
She's the winner.

59
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,640
- Joo Woo Jae.
- Joo Woo Jae.

60
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Do you have 270 dollars?

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,780
- Hey, you...
- She's the winner.

62
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,400
Why did you say that?

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,950
- She has 270 dollars?
- No.

64
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,470
You should thank me.

65
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,080
- I have zero dollars.
- Hang on.

66
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,640
No one on my team has money.

67
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,050
- We are...
- We can start saving money now.

68
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,660
All right. I will explain the rules.

69
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,250
Today, we're doing something
Se Chan loves.

70
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,330
- Me?
- What is it?

71
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,520
It's Race of Groups where you will
complete missions in groups.

72
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,860
- Race of Groups.
- Race of Groups.

73
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,270
Se Chan went
to Jeju Island as a group.

74
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,270
(The truth behind the group activity
that Se Chan likes.)

75
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,160
(One month ago)

76
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,160
(I went there
with Jae Joon and Jin Ho.)

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,610
(And there were a few more
in the group.)

78
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,140
(The word "group"
flew out of his month.)

79
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,410
(Apparently, there were
three more people.)

80
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,190
(His trip to Jeju Island
remains unsolved like that.)

81
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,780
- In groups.
- I heard Se Chan is seeing someone.

82
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,750
- Who?
- I heard Se Chan is seeing someone.

83
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,630
- No, I'm not.
- People say that.

84
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,600
Will you just let him see someone?
Why would you bring that up?

85
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,890
Just let him date.

86
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,390
So Min, let him see someone.

87
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,860
- Look at his face.
- She made things awkward.

88
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,890
I barely know the trot singer,

89
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,330
but things got awkward
between me and her.

90
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,330
Why?

91
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,770
Her stylist suddenly said...

92
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,970
(What about Mirani?)

93
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,580
- What about Mirani?
- No.

94
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,680
Mirani, I'm Se Chan.

95
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,450
Things are awkward
between Mirani and me too.

96
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,140
- Hey, today...
- Everyone I see...

97
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,390
"How is So Min?"
"What do you think of Mirani?"

98
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,790
"What do you think
of the trot singer?"

99
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,960
This is So Min's big picture.

100
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,020
This is driving me crazy.

101
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,860
She's trying to isolate you
in the show business.

102
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,800
They say you become pretty
when you're in love.

103
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,230
- This is a good thing.
- But his face is a mess.

104
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,060
- I can't date anyone.
- He's too ugly to date someone.

105
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,200
- To date someone...
- I can't date anyone.

106
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,800
All right.
So this is the Race of Groups.

107
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,830
The three members with the most
mission funds will get prizes.

108
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,480
And the two with the lowest money
will get penalties.

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,240
- There will be a penalty.
- Okay.

110
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,800
Just like the name,
the first half will be a race...

111
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,340
between the teams of 3, 3, 3, and 1.

112
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,680
And in the second half,
you'll be divided into two teams.

113
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
So it will be a 5-on-5 race.

114
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,790
When the first race is over,
the two teams with...

115
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,360
the least money will be absorbed...

116
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,550
into the other teams
in the second half.

117
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,360
Before we start,
I will exchange your money...

118
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
for R money.

119
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,670
The exchange rate is 10 to 1.

120
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,040
So you get 1 dollar of R money
with 10 dollars of cash.

121
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,010
Now you may get changed
before the first mission.

122
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,680
(Team So Min: 47 dollars,
Team Do Kwon: 12, 8, 27.5 dollars)

123
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,340
(Team Woo Jae: 5, 18, 6.8 dollars)
(Team Yi Kyung: 0 dollars)

124
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,450
All right. What should we do today?

125
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,450
Okay.

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,420
So Min looks so lonely.

127
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,990
- Why am I lonely when I'm with you?
- She has a lot of money.

128
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,360
- She's rich.
- She's the winner.

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,680
- I'm with you guys.
- So Min.

130
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,490
That's a fake smile.

131
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,120
Why? I'm feeling good.

132
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,760
(Only her eyes are smiling.)

133
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,170
- That's a lot better.
- I'm very happy now.

134
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,430
- You are?
- That's fake.

135
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,300
I'm in a good mood.

136
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,040
That's not true. You're not happy.

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,830
Jeon So Min's fake life.

138
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,330
Your life is just as fake as mine.

139
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,800
All right. I'll explain the rules.

140
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,050
This mission is
Storytelling Strawberry.

141
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,210
- Strawberry?
- Strawberry?

142
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,710
You know the strawberry game.

143
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,490
- It's four beats.
- This one?

144
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,740
- It's too hard for me.
- It's tricky.

145
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,020
This is Jae Suk's thing.

146
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,460
But this game isn't
about the rhythm.

147
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,830
I'm good at this game.

148
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,180
- Do you see the letters here?
- Yes.

149
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,520
- It says ji, go, sa, and so on.
- Yes.

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,170
The first player says something
that starts with "ji."

151
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,360
Like how?

152
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,060
Something like,
"Ji Suk Jin is the best."

153
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,240
And the second player says
something that starts with "go."

154
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,280
But you're supposed to say something
that fits a certain situation.

155
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
(They can only say things
that fit the suggested situation.)

156
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,150
- For example...
- We have to make something up.

157
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,720
- Let's say the keyword is diet.
- Diet.

158
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,870
And the letter you're given
is "un." Then...

159
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,290
you say, "I need to work out."

160
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,160
And you call
the next player like "Haha."

161
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,050
Then Haha should say something
about diet with the next letter.

162
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,050
- "I should eat sweet potatoes."
- Something like that.

163
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,100
- I call the next player.
- Something related to it.

164
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,430
Call the next player.

165
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,530
(They should make something up
with the given letter.)

166
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,930
Since this is a difficult game,

167
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,990
you are allowed
to attack in three turns.

168
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,490
- Okay.
- Okay.

169
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,410
Isn't this easier than numbers?

170
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,800
- This is easy.
- It sounds easier.

171
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,110
But you have to say something that's
appropriate for the situation.

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,480
Jae Suk, it's easy, isn't it?

173
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,500
This is so easy. I can do this.

174
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,980
- But your lips are parched already.
- Don't worry. I can do this.

175
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,150
Let's start.

176
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,010
- The first word.
- What is it?

177
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,680
- New employee.
- Okay.

178
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,590
You should say something
a new employee would say.

179
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,180
- Suk Jin, will you go first?
- Let's start with Seok Sam.

180
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,900
- Start with the letter "ji?"
- Yes. And you call the next player.

181
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,450
- Hang on.
- Okay. It starts with "ji."

182
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,760
- New employee?
- New employee.

183
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,860
Start.

184
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,100
- Start already?
- Sure.

185
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,670
- Just do it.
- Okay.

186
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,930
(Role: New employee)

187
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,130
It's not Ji Suk Jin, right?

188
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,130
- What does that mean?
- That's true.

189
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,130
It's not Ji Suk Jin, right?

190
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,980
- What does that mean?
- That's true.

191
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,180
I'm not a new employee.

192
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,280
- You can't do that.
- Ji Suk Jin isn't a new employee.

193
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,240
You should say something
that a new employee would say.

194
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,050
- If you were a new employee...
- What are you doing?

195
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,090
- Let's say you're a new employee.
- What was that?

196
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,610
- Say something as a new employee.
- Hey.

197
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
- I don't have any experience.
- "I just got here now."

198
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,050
- Something like this.
- "Make some coffee now."

199
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,490
- You're good at this.
- Sure.

200
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,090
- "I'm late."
- After I say something,

201
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,320
it goes this way?

202
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,620
No, you should call someone.

203
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,820
You should call someone.

204
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,230
I'm so sick of this.

205
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,860
- He still doesn't know the rules.
- We can't play this game.

206
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,990
What's wrong with him?

207
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,040
- Just give up.
- Okay.

208
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,630
Okay. I got it.

209
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,610
- We need to win money.
- Yes. Do it right.

210
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,070
Let's start again.

211
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,300
Start.

212
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,850
I'm going to work.

213
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,370
Haha.

214
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,280
Thank you, Assistant Manager.

215
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,850
Suk Jin.

216
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,090
(Role: New employee, Sa)

217
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,220
Fraud.

218
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,990
- What?
- My gosh.

219
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,590
(The new employee raises his voice
all of a sudden.)

220
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,300
- What was that?
- You sound like the boss.

221
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,530
You're a mean boss.

222
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,690
You should call someone else.

223
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,400
- Why did you come back to me?
- We're a team.

224
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,670
- But...
- This is funny.

225
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,400
- You don't understand the rules.
- It's not like that.

226
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
This isn't a word chain game.

227
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,860
- He can't do this.
- Hey.

228
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,200
What are you doing?

229
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,180
There should be rules.
Why did you come right back to me?

230
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,000
You should say something like
"Hello, boss."

231
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You should try it.

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,700
- All right.
- Let's do this.

233
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,480
Woo Jae!

234
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,510
Let's win.

235
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,940
- Why are you so bad at this?
- You should do it right.

236
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,310
Let's do it right.

237
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,550
Jong Kook goes first this time.

238
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,660
- Me?
- Yes.

239
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,680
- Where?
- It's "ra."

240
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,880
- It's "ra."
- Ra.

241
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,250
(Role: New employee, Ra)

242
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,450
I have no time to eat ramyeon.

243
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,490
Woo Jae, Woo Jae. Like this?

244
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,600
(Woo Jae, Woo Jae. Like this?)

245
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,170
- "Woo Jae, Woo Jae?" What was that?
- "Woo Jae."

246
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,340
- "Woo Jae." Like this?
- "Woo Jae."

247
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,490
It feels like I'm playing...

248
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,930
- a game with old men.
- What are you doing?

249
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,280
- We can't move forward.
- What was that?

250
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,630
- I was just...
- Just say it once.

251
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,500
It's fine
as long as I call out a name.

252
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,420
- I just need to call out a name.
- Why are you so bad at this game?

253
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
- Say it gently.
- I said that to the beat.

254
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,570
"Woo Jae, Woo Jae." What was that?

255
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,220
Woo Jae, Woo Jae. What about it?

256
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,940
- Woo Jae, Woo Jae. It's fine.
- Woo Jae.

257
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,050
- What are you talking about?
- Doesn't it sound nice?

258
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,510
Woo Jae, Woo Jae. Can't I do that?

259
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,030
Say it just once?

260
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,120
- You can't do that.
- "Ha Do Kwon." You can say this.

261
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,430
You guys are so bad at this.

262
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,660
Do Kwon goes first. And it's "ra."

263
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,800
Start.

264
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,190
(Do Kwon goes first
with the letter "ra.")

265
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,190
Can I listen to the radio?

266
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,760
Suk Jin.

267
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,540
It's time for the meeting.

268
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,130
Woo Jae.

269
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,110
Oh, no. I'm late for the meeting.

270
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,610
Suk Jin.

271
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,200
Move your car.

272
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,070
(Laughing)

273
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,240
The new employee sounds rude.

274
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,990
(He yells all of a sudden.)

275
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,790
The new employee sounds rude.

276
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,380
- I can understand though.
- Suk Jin.

277
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,430
- It was okay though.
- It's fine.

278
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,050
He has no idea
what a new employee is like.

279
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,160
Call Jae Suk instead.

280
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,300
- He's like a treasure house.
- Suk Jin.

281
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,320
- He's your teammate.
- We're on the same team.

282
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,970
You two are on the same team.

283
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,490
Do you have to see my shirt?

284
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,670
Okay.

285
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,200
- Let's do this.
- This is fun.

286
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,540
- It's not fun.
- So Min.

287
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,050
So Min is alone.
You should call her.

288
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,300
- This is very confusing.
- All right.

289
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,070
The keyword is mom.

290
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,420
- Mom?
- Mom.

291
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,070
Something your mom would say.

292
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,680
- Let's start with Yi Kyung.
- Yi Kyung goes first.

293
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,350
- What letter?
- Woo.

294
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,550
- Woo?
- Woo.

295
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,750
Start.

296
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,310
(Role: Mom, Woo)

297
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,730
I love my son.

298
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,820
(I love my son.)

299
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,900
Suk Jin.

300
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,260
- He's our team.
- Bring me a toothpick.

301
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,400
Suk Jin.

302
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,900
(Startled)

303
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,040
(Bring me a toothpick?)

304
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,430
- Seriously.
- I'm not doing this.

305
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,870
- Hey.
- Why me?

306
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,540
What are you three doing?

307
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,470
- I'm not doing this.
- This is not fun.

308
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,600
- I don't want to play this game.
- What's this?

309
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,070
Let's not do this. There must be
another game, right?

310
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,840
- What are you three doing?
- Why...

311
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,480
- Why did you call him?
- I just...

312
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,840
- Everyone called Suk Jin, so...
- This is ridiculous.

313
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,420
- We're on the same team.
- I mean, why...

314
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,890
Everyone calls Suk Jin,
and I just did the same.

315
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,030
I was so surprised.

316
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,480
Why did you attack our teammate?

317
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,190
You should look far ahead.

318
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,590
- He attacked his own team.
- Yi Kyung.

319
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,720
Don't attack your teammates.

320
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,060
Why did you attack your teammate?

321
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,770
I just said that because
everyone kept calling Suk Jin.

322
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,040
Why are they so bad at this?

323
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,640
- Jae Suk, you go first.
- Me?

324
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,540
Let's call Jae Suk no matter what.

325
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,300
- Something a mom would say.
- Mom.

326
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,600
- Who goes first?
- Jae Suk.

327
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,700
- Jae Suk goes first.
- Okay.

328
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,470
Start.

329
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,620
(Role: Mom, Cha)

330
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,050
Hey, Mr. Cha Seung Won.

331
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,050
- What?
- No, that's not right.

332
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,790
(Hey, Mr. Cha Seung Won.)

333
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,890
(Wrong)

334
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,890
What are you doing?

335
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,660
It should start with "cha."

336
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,450
- It was just an exclamation.
- Why do you use an exclamation?

337
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,430
- It's just an exclamation.
- You lose one point.

338
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,770
It's an exclamation.

339
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,430
Why would you say Cha Seung Won?

340
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,560
"Hey" is an exclamation.

341
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,690
- Are you a fool?
- What about Cha Seung Won?

342
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,270
- Seriously...
- I mean...

343
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,540
Why would a mom call Cha Seung Won?

344
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,730
"Hey" is an exclamation.

345
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,800
Why did you say "hey?"
It should start with "cha."

346
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,040
Is that a silent syllable?

347
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,340
This is like poetic license.

348
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,280
- Poetic license?
- Why would he say "hey?"

349
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,680
Gosh. Seriously...

350
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,940
We can't continue the game.

351
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,580
So Min goes first with "jeo."

352
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,920
- Me?
- My goodness.

353
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
- It's about mom, right?
- Yes.

354
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,310
Start.

355
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,680
Honey, come and eat.

356
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,890
Jae Suk.

357
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,950
I don't know what you are doing now.

358
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,060
I don't want to do this.

359
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,630
(A letter from Mom)

360
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,770
I don't want to do this.

361
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,800
- What's this?
- What was that?

362
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,040
- Why is it so long?
- "I don't know..."

363
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,510
"I don't know..."

364
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,970
"I don't know
what you are doing now."

365
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,930
Why does it have to be so long?

366
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,970
You have to make it short.

367
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,180
- Is that what your wife says?
- Leave him be.

368
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,210
I mean...

369
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,380
- Why is it so hard?
- Why is he sending a message?

370
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,680
Hey. It can get long sometimes.

371
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,550
"Check your blood sugar level."

372
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,720
You just never stopped talking.

373
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,660
"I love you, honey."

374
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,850
- "Let's eat, honey."
- This is unbelievable.

375
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,430
- "What are you doing, honey?"
- Or...

376
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,900
"Go buy some glass noodles."

377
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,330
- Mind your own business.
- Mind your own business.

378
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,870
Mind your own business.

379
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,560
- Stop sending out messages.
- This is a mess.

380
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,670
Why did you send a message?

381
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,410
- Can't I say things like that?
- No.

382
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,970
- Don't send a message.
- All right.

383
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,340
I'll wait and see how good you are.

384
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,940
- Bring it on.
- Let's see how good you are.

385
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,100
- Let me try.
- What's the letter?

386
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,680
- Is it mom again?
- Haha goes first.

387
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,790
- The keyword is announcer.
- All right.

388
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,250
It's about an announcer.

389
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,620
- Start with the given letter.
- Which one?

390
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,050
It's "dang."

391
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,550
Start.

392
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,980
(Role: Announcer, Dang)

393
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,630
This is it for the news
from Dangjin.

394
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,160
- What did you say?
- Suk Jin.

395
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,500
The intersection is clogged
with traffic now.

396
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,400
(The intersection is clogged
with traffic now.)

397
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,560
Woo Jae.

398
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,930
High school students are preparing
for the college entrance exam.

399
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,410
(High school students are preparing
for the college entrance exam.)

400
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,510
Jong Kook.

401
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,230
There was an accident.

402
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,380
Ji... What?

403
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,880
- What kind of announcer is that?
- What's wrong?

404
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,750
- "There was an accident."
- What kind of announcer...

405
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,680
- It's the North Korean news show.
- I mean...

406
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,920
An announcer...

407
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,790
- That's not an announcer.
- I said it like that on purpose.

408
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,850
Let's say you succeeded.

409
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,390
I'll resume right away.

410
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,080
I'll start right away.

411
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,320
(Role: Announcer, Ga)

412
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,400
So Min.

413
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,400
Waiting without moving.

414
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,670
- What?
- What was that?

415
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,170
- Woo Jae.
- What was that?

416
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,900
- What?
- What was that?

417
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,730
- What does that mean?
- "Waiting without moving?"

418
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,430
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That sounds strange.

419
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,830
That's just what announcers say.

420
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,050
What does that mean?

421
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,510
I'm just doing an impression.

422
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,150
- Like how?
- It's not just about the tone.

423
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,680
What is the news about?

424
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,810
- This?
- What accident?

425
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,810
The culprit is waiting
without moving...

426
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,760
- in front of the bank.
- What?

427
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,790
- A culprit?
- Hey.

428
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,130
- What culprit?
- What?

429
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,760
Why is the culprit waiting?

430
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,590
Why is the culprit waiting?
He should run away.

431
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,160
Why is the culprit waiting?

432
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,800
The culprit is waiting
without moving in front of the bank.

433
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,370
- Who is he waiting for?
- The police?

434
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,770
- That doesn't make sense.
- The police...

435
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,830
- This is just...
- This is ridiculous.

436
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,410
- That doesn't make sense.
- No.

437
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,600
"Waiting without moving."

438
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,470
- Shall we change?
- Yes. We will change.

439
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,640
Who goes first this time?

440
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,010
Something Kim Jong Kook would say.

441
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,010
(The new keyword, Kim Jong Kook)

442
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,070
- Me?
- My gosh. This is a problem.

443
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,570
- What Jong Kook would say?
- Yes. Jae Suk goes first.

444
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,750
Can I continue?

445
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,810
- I will just...
- With "ji?"

446
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,120
- Start with "sa."
- "Sa?"

447
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,920
Start.

448
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,810
I love you, Ji Hyo.

449
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,620
Jong Kook.

450
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,390
Go away, you punk!

451
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,130
Jae Suk.

452
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,160
Turn on the radio.

453
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,950
What?

454
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,130
(Kim Jong Kook and radio?)

455
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,040
- What was that?
- This is...

456
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,400
He keeps saying radio.

457
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,870
- That's all he says.
- Radio?

458
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,670
Is radio all you know?

459
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,330
Go as in Go Doo Shim.

460
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,800
Ra as in radio.

461
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,550
Cha as in Cha Seung Won.

462
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,280
You can say things like
"Don't eat ramyeon."

463
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
"I'll kill you if you eat ramyeon."

464
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,210
- "Who was it?" Something like that.
- Doesn't he say to his manager,

465
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,150
- "Turn on the radio?"
- I don't listen to the radio.

466
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,160
Let's eliminate one team.

467
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,420
- I've never been this upset here.
- Why is it so hard?

468
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,760
- Seriously.
- I'm so upset.

469
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,980
I'll go first. Let's begin.

470
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,190
Let's begin.

471
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,930
- Think of Jong Kook's personality.
- Why is it so hard?

472
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,030
- "Don't eat ramyeon!" Like this.
- Ramyeon.

473
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,640
- That's a good example.
- Why can't my answer count?

474
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,410
This time, we'll start with So Min.

475
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,140
- It's "woo," right?
- Yes.

476
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,830
- Okay.
- Ready, go.

477
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,010
Woo Jae, you jerk!

478
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,880
Woo Jae.

479
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,570
Do you want to lose all your teeth?

480
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,310
Suk Jin.

481
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,340
Go to your car, you punk!

482
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,620
Hold on. Do I have
a personality disorder or what?

483
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,450
- Do I have a personality disorder?
- Se Chan.

484
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,630
Why won't that jerk
come to play soccer with us?

485
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,680
(Role: Kim Jong Kook, jeo)

486
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,130
Jae Suk.

487
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,930
Get lost this instant, you jerk!

488
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,530
Se Chan.

489
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,530
How dare that jerk?

490
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,140
Suk Jin.

491
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,800
(Role: Kim Jong Kook, go)

492
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,200
(Taken aback)

493
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,430
(Role: Kim Jong Kook, go)

494
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,430
- It's "go."
- What are you doing?

495
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,750
(The skit ended helplessly.)

496
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,280
- It was going well.
- What was that?

497
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,020
- We were doing well.
- It felt like it was never-ending.

498
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,180
This is how we should continue
the game.

499
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,310
- It was never-ending. Everyone...
- It was fun.

500
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,050
- Everyone...
- I apologize on his behalf.

501
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,680
- I just came up with an idea.
- It was fun.

502
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,680
- Right. It was really fun.
- Everyone is good at this game.

503
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,630
- It wasn't that bad, right?
- He's so bad at improvising.

504
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,820
- What's your problem?
- It's understandable, isn't it?

505
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,060
- Let's play another round.
- It was good.

506
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,170
- We just have to get upset.
- Let's do it again.

507
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,230
- All we have to do is get upset.
- How come you're all so good at it?

508
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,170
- We just have to say "you punk..."
- Or "you jerk."

509
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,730
or "you jerk"
at the end of the sentence.

510
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,800
That's true.

511
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
(Everyone except for Seok Sam is
good at acting like Jong Kook.)

512
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,930
- This is fun.
- Everyone except for him did well.

513
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,380
Let's keep playing the game
with the same role.

514
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,700
That was so funny.

515
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,340
- The next role is...
- A new role?

516
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,020
- So Min, do you want to go first?
- Let's start with So Min.

517
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,020
- It's a tour guide.
- A tour guide?

518
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,180
Where do you begin?

519
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,150
- Let's start at "ji."
- "Ji?"

520
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,520
- "Ji."
- A tour guide?

521
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,660
- A tour guide. It's easy.
- Ready, go.

522
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,930
Mediterranean food is good.

523
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,400
Jong Kook.

524
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,530
Tilt your head up and look at it.

525
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,300
Ji Hyo.

526
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,190
(He stuttered.)

527
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,040
- What?
- Gosh, you.

528
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,090
(It was a team kill.)

529
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,540
- Hey.
- Why did you do that?

530
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,880
- How did it happen?
- I meant to say his name.

531
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,330
- But I said Ji Hyo's name instead.
- "Ji Hyo."

532
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,440
- I guess...
- I'm sorry.

533
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,800
- Hey.
- it came out wrong.

534
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,010
Why did you say my name?

535
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,620
- I hadn't thought of the target.
- "Ji Hyo."

536
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,620
(Team Do Kwon lost a point
because of Jong Kook's team kill.)

537
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,340
- "Ji Hyo."
- That was cute.

538
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,310
- You should've pulled it off.
- He sounded cute.

539
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,550
- I didn't expect to be called.
- It's easy.

540
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,890
We'll start with Se Chan this time.

541
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,980
- A comment for product placement?
- What should we start with?

542
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,630
- What is that?
- It's difficult.

543
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,630
Something you'd say...

544
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,720
- when you do product placement.
- Okay.

545
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,760
- To please the advertiser.
- Okay. Let's go.

546
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,800
Ready, go.

547
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,400
- It's very delicious.
- Good.

548
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,640
Ji Hyo.

549
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,510
What is that?

550
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,270
Se Chan.

551
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,540
It's so high in sugar.

552
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,910
Jae Suk.

553
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,470
At this moment, I'll eat this,
and I'll really...

554
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,810
(The letter to the advertiser)

555
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,810
- Listen. Let me explain.
- Hey!

556
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,420
- Assume the push-up position!
- Hold on.

557
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,890
- Assume the push-up position!
- Why?

558
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,390
- Stop writing a letter!
- What's wrong with it?

559
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,630
- What's the problem?
- What's wrong with you?

560
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,030
- Why would you write a letter?
- It's for product placement,

561
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,030
- so we should be wholehearted.
- It's a game.

562
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,720
- You should follow the rules.
- Gosh, seriously.

563
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,460
- Please keep time.
- He's unbelievable.

564
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,830
- That's not fair.
- He keeps making a video message.

565
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,910
You guys won't let me express
my creativity.

566
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,200
I can't believe this.

567
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,570
We're not telling a folktale story.

568
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,780
- What was that?
- Gosh.

569
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,440
- That was...
- Woo Jae will go first this time.

570
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,510
Woo Jae will go first.

571
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,780
Say what a customer at a restaurant
would say.

572
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,070
- What?
- A customer at a restaurant?

573
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,710
- That's not bad.
- It's too easy.

574
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,150
- Let's do this.
- Ready, go. It's "woo."

575
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,340
(Role: a customer
at a restaurant, woo)

576
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,450
Please take out the burdock.

577
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,290
Jong Kook.

578
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,980
I almost broke my tooth.

579
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,580
Jae Suk.

580
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,630
Can we have two servings of brisket?

581
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,260
Se Chan.

582
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,000
Excuse me.
Can I get more radish kimchi?

583
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,670
Suk Jin.

584
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,500
You ordered this!

585
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,140
- Ji Hyo.
- What did you say?

586
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,140
"You ordered this?"

587
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,910
(A customer at a restaurant would
say, "You ordered this?")

588
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,610
- "You ordered this?"
- What did you say?

589
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,910
Why did you get upset?
What did you say?

590
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,500
- Why would you get upset?
- I'll explain the situation.

591
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,420
- Why did you talk in an angry tone?
- Let me explain.

592
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,650
- What did you say?
- It happened not long ago.

593
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,390
- Why did you get upset?
- My wife and I...

594
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,920
were eating together.

595
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,120
- And she didn't like the food.
- I'm so dumbfounded.

596
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,820
- She asked why I ordered the dish.
- That's irrelevant.

597
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,360
- I said, "You ordered this."
- That's not acceptable.

598
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,630
- It happened at a restaurant.
- "You ordered this."

599
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,060
Why? It's true.

600
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,660
- I was eating with my wife.
- No, that's weird.

601
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,690
- It didn't suit her palate.
- It's weird.

602
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,260
It's weird. Why would you get upset?

603
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,960
- That's just your story.
- It's weird.

604
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,410
That's not a usual situation.

605
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,110
- Why would you get upset?
- That happens.

606
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,270
- Haha, do you want to go first?
- Yes.

607
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,880
- Is the situation the same?
- Yes. It's "i." Ready, go.

608
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,850
This is good.

609
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,540
Jeon So Min.

610
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,270
Give us the tea first, please.

611
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,920
Jong Kook.

612
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,710
I won't eat this.

613
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,420
Jae Suk.

614
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,250
Who are you to refuse to eat it?

615
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,020
(Role: a customer
at a restaurant, dang)

616
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,330
(The conversation with "you")

617
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,630
- Gosh.
- Why?

618
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,460
Couldn't you think of any other word
but "you?"

619
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
Gosh!

620
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,100
Don't ruin the game.

621
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,260
- But... What's the problem?
- Don't ruin the game!

622
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,310
- We're enjoying playing the game.
- Hey...

623
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,380
- He's a fun spoiler.
- Don't ruin it again.

624
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,410
- "I don't like glass noodles."
- Don't ruin the game.

625
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,650
"I'd like to have
extra glass noodles."

626
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,080
- An owner can get upset sometimes.
- Jae Suk, that wasn't relevant.

627
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,240
You could've said,
"I have high blood sugar."

628
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,680
I mean, that's... Gosh.

629
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,620
Everybody seems to be upset
with "you."

630
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,150
Glass noodles.

631
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,010
- I didn't think of "glass noodles."
- Oh, right.

632
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,680
- Say what Jong Kook would say.
- Good.

633
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
- What Jong Kook would say?
- That's great.

634
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,720
- All we have to do is get upset.
- But it'll go on for too long.

635
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,750
- We'll start with Se Chan at "ji."
- We just have to get upset.

636
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,930
- "Ji?"
- Ready, go.

637
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,830
How dare he?

638
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,490
Jae Suk.

639
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,400
Keep going on like that
and see what happens.

640
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,960
Haha.

641
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,810
You're such a troublemaker,
you jerk.

642
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,370
Jae Suk.

643
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,080
Go, you jerk!

644
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,810
Se Chan.

645
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,440
Eat ramyeon, you jerk!

646
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,150
Suk Jin.

647
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,850
(Role: Kim Jong Kook, woo)

648
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,090
Do well while I'm spoiling you,
you punk.

649
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,440
Gosh. What was that?

650
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,740
What...

651
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,710
(Do well while I'm spoiling you,
you punk.)

652
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,520
(The skit is over.)

653
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,930
- What was that?
- What did you say?

654
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,490
- I said, "Do well..."
- We could've made it to the end.

655
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,630
- What are you doing?
- "Come to my gym."

656
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,400
- Something like that.
- I mean...

657
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,290
- "Do well while I'm spoiling you."
- What were you thinking?

658
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,370
That's just ridiculous.

659
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,790
- What's that?
- Take his team out of the game.

660
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,760
- What are you saying?
- Take Team Orange out of the game.

661
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,070
- We were doing great.
- You understand, right?

662
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,370
- Nonsense.
- It's understandable, right?

663
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,610
- I mean, why...
- It's the easiest role.

664
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,110
I'm sorry,
but exactly what did you say?

665
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,270
- Spoiling someone?
- Stop it while I'm spoiling you,

666
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,580
- you punk.
- "Do well while I'm spoiling you."

667
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,240
Why doesn't it count?

668
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,040
- It's what he would say.
- Why are you so bad at this game?

669
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,660
That's not what Jong Kook would say.

670
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,280
- Me? Okay.
- Jong Kook will go first.

671
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,590
Ready, go.

672
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,930
(Role: Kim Jong Kook, woo)

673
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,250
Come to my gym.

674
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,060
So Min.

675
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,130
I'll go play soccer now.

676
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,370
Woo Jae.

677
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,190
Come to play soccer with us.

678
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,990
Jong Kook.

679
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,760
Are you talking to me?

680
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,770
(He suddenly spoke cutely.)

681
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,970
(He failed.)

682
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,430
- "Are you talking to me?"
- He can't act like himself.

683
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,770
- That was cute.
- He failed to speak as he does.

684
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,970
- "Are you talking to me?"
- That was cute.

685
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,710
- Are you talking to us?
- "Are you talking to me?"

686
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,710
Hey, you called my name too late.

687
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,010
- That was cute.
- Don't you think so?

688
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,820
- "Are you talking to me?"
- "Are you talking to me?"

689
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,250
- I said what my friend would say...
- Jong Kook.

690
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,180
- What's wrong with that?
- in response to the question.

691
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,480
- But that was...
- Look.

692
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,160
- Jong Kook. This is...
- "Are you talking to me?"

693
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,630
- acceptable.
- Why can't you stay on the beat?

694
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,790
- "Are you talking to me?"
- "Are you talking to me?"

695
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,140
- What was that?
- Right?

696
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,290
- It's over.
- All right.

697
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,110
- The game is over.
- Yes.

698
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,270
The team in the first place is...

699
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,570
(Result of
the Storytelling Strawberry)

700
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,630
Team So Min.

701
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,630
- Really?
- It's good to be a one-person team.

702
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,810
She doesn't have to worry about...

703
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,010
- the other members.
- That's true.

704
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,840
- Right. She has no such worries.
- I only worry about myself.

705
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,700
- The team in second place is...
- I'm jealous.

706
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,580
- Team Woo Jae.
- Yes, Team Woo Jae.

707
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,200
Team Do Kwon placed third.

708
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,580
Team Yi Kyung placed fourth place
by a large margin.

709
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,990
- They'll likely be absorbed.
- It must be really nice.

710
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,410
- But they have no money.
- We have no money.

711
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,590
- You have your money, right?
- Yes.

712
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,590
Gosh, I have no money. How...

713
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,530
The maximum amount of money
you can receive varies...

714
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,950
depending on the team's ranking.

715
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,660
Write down the amount you want
within the limit.

716
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,120
The member who wrote the highest
amount won't receive any money.

717
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,470
- I see.
- My gosh. Really?

718
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,970
Only the one who wrote
the highest amount can't get money?

719
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,200
- The team in the first place...
- So Min will get all the money.

720
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,280
- gets 50 dollars. You get it all.
- I see.

721
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,240
- Thank you.
- The next team gets 40 dollars.

722
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,340
We'll begin right now.

723
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,410
Write the amount you want to receive
that's no more than 40 dollars.

724
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,320
The member with the highest amount
won't receive any money.

725
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,590
The member with the lowest amount
can receive it, right?

726
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,910
Yes, the other two members will
receive money.

727
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,650
We don't need to get
a lot of money now, right?

728
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,880
- Then...
- Haha is trying to trick them...

729
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,330
- as always.
- Haha is trying to trick them.

730
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,000
Haha, let's let him have it all.

731
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,330
We'll write 40 dollars.
You should write 39 dollars.

732
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,800
- You can get it all.
- Right.

733
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,420
- With an innocent look on his face.
- Okay.

734
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,300
- Write 39 dollars.
- Okay.

735
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,740
- Right?
- With an innocent look on his face.

736
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,370
What if the three members write
the same amount?

737
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,580
None of them would receive money.

738
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,580
Oh, my. You can't get any money
if you write the same amount.

739
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,580
All right. Show us your boards
on the count of three.

740
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,910
One.

741
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,110
Two.

742
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,640
Three.

743
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,140
Three.

744
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,020
He wrote 20 dollars,
and he wrote 8 dollars.

745
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,680
- Okay. I got 8 dollars.
- Right. He can't get 20 dollars.

746
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,150
Haha won't get any money. The others
will get 8 dollars and 18 dollars.

747
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,590
- I got at least eight dollars.
- Haha,

748
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,830
- why did you write 20 dollars?
- It's a shame though.

749
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,830
(All of them got timid
and wrote small amounts of money.)

750
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,120
My gosh. I thought hard. It was hard
for me to make the decision.

751
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,190
Gosh. They're so petty.

752
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,970
- I thought of writing 22 dollars.
- You have a lot of money.

753
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,660
- Right.
- The maximum amount is 30 dollars.

754
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,780
- Thirty dollars?
- Yes.

755
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,930
Okay. I shouldn't be greedy.
I won't be greedy.

756
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,980
You should write an amount
under ten dollars to get the money.

757
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,820
(Their current sums: Jong Kook, 8,
Ji Hyo, 27.50, Do Kwon, 12 dollars)

758
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,140
The minimum amount is one dollar.

759
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,110
- It's better to get one dollar...
- Exactly.

760
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,520
in this situation.

761
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,490
Okay. One, two, three. Show us.

762
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,490
I wrote ten dollars.

763
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,390
- Show us.
- I wrote ten dollars.

764
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,500
- Jong Kook got the money.
- Right?

765
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,830
- Great. I got it.
- He got the money.

766
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,430
- So did Do Kwon.
- Jong Kook and Do Kwon got it.

767
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,000
- They're quite gutsy.
- She was considerate of them.

768
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,360
Right. She has a lot of money.

769
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,540
The maximum amount for you is
20 dollars.

770
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,600
- It'll be intense.
- We won't be considerate...

771
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,980
- We all need money.
- But...

772
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,840
If Yi Kyung writes 20 dollars...
Is it 20 dollars and under?

773
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,870
Yes.

774
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,280
(Peeking)

775
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,480
It'd be funny
if they all wrote 20 dollars.

776
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,020
My gosh. Jae Suk.

777
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,380
I should write at least this much.
We don't go small.

778
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,610
Right. That's true.

779
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,790
- Are you all done?
- Yes.

780
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,190
One, two. Show us.

781
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,060
Show us.

782
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,270
Show us.

783
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,630
Eighteen dollars?
You wrote a large amount.

784
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,690
I thought they'd write
a higher amount.

785
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,360
- As a result, Suk Jin...
- Okay!

786
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,740
- got the money.
- Well played.

787
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,010
- Right. That went well.
- Exactly.

788
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,600
As a result, the two teams
with the least money will be...

789
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,750
- merged with the other teams.
- Really?

790
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,170
The team in the last place is...

791
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,020
- Team Yi Kyung.
- Yes.

792
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,080
We all knew it.

793
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,520
The team in the third place is...

794
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,750
- Team Woo Jae.
- What?

795
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,020
(Team Woo Jae placed third.)

796
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,350
- They placed 3rd?
- We placed 3rd?

797
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,330
- Why?
- But they have a lot of money.

798
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,500
- It's good. If we join So Min...
- No, it's not.

799
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,830
The members of the two teams will
join the other teams.

800
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,590
We'll get hit during the game.

801
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,970
I wonder what game they'll play.

802
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,930
I bet
they're going to slap each other.

803
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,430
The last two teams should sit
on this side.

804
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,860
- On this side?
- He said we should sit here.

805
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,160
Jeonsobari

806
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,010
Four of them will join Team So Min.

807
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,340
- Okay!
- Wait for me.

808
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,020
- Who do you want on your team?
- I want no penniless members.

809
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,110
- I'm warning you.
- I'm penniless.

810
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,480
Don't join my team
if you're penniless.

811
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,520
- So Min, I'll join your team.
- Me too.

812
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,880
I've saved up enough money
to join your team.

813
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,260
- I'll join your team.
- Those leeches.

814
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,830
- I'll explain the rules now.
- Okay.

815
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,350
If you win first,
you get to choose your team first...

816
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,060
and lose less money.

817
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,860
You suffer less damage
if you win your match.

818
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,890
I see.

819
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,740
As you can see,
you'll play Cham, Cham, Cham.

820
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,430
You'll have one-on-one matches.
Two players stand on the beam.

821
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,740
When your attack succeeds,
you hit your opponent.

822
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,900
If your opponent falls off,
he's out.

823
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,400
Oh, dear. That sounds intense.

824
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,870
Also, you will draw a number...

825
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,670
to make the list of matches.

826
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,750
Three pairs will have matches
in the order of numbers from 1 to 6.

827
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,760
Got it.

828
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
- Numbers 1 and 2 have a match.
- Yes.

829
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,060
And the winner gets to choose
their team.

830
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,880
Right away.

831
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,260
Then numbers 3 and 4 have a match,
and the winner chooses his team.

832
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,390
And then numbers 5 and 6
have a match.

833
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,860
The losers have another match
to choose their teams.

834
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,090
Oh, that's how the losers move up.

835
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,660
- We'll be at a disadvantage...
- You'll be at an advantage...

836
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,740
if you pick a small number
and win your match.

837
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,810
- Okay!
- Okay.

838
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,900
Let's draw a number.

839
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,310
Pick one.

840
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,900
- I got number two!
- Come out.

841
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,910
- You picked number one?
- Yes.

842
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,980
- Okay.
- I'm number four.

843
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,320
- I'm number three.
- My gosh.

844
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,140
- Number 3.
- I picked number 5.

845
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,180
I should win this match...

846
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,260
You'll get to choose your team
and lose no money.

847
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,260
Okay. Good.

848
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,230
I want to see
how well Woo Jae can do.

849
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,590
- Woo Jae moves slowly.
- Woo Jae is so skinny.

850
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,730
- Woo Jae could be blown away.
- I won't. I have a strong core.

851
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,070
- Okay.
- He has a strong core?

852
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,300
He says he has a strong core.

853
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,270
The balance beam is
wider than I thought.

854
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,400
- Wait.
- It's a wide beam.

855
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,980
He's not just skinny.

856
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,980
(The anchovy with a strong core
has never played this game before.)

857
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,280
It won't be easy to hold out
on the beam.

858
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
Here we go.

859
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
(Jae Suk will go first.)

860
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,900
Ready. Cham, cham, cham.

861
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,110
- Okay. Now, he can attack.
- He defended successfully.

862
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,520
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Oh, gosh.

863
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
Cham, cham, cham.

864
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,410
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Okay.

865
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,820
(Jae Suk failed to defend.)

866
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,790
- I can hit him now, right?
- Here we go.

867
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,290
- Go ahead.
- Here we go.

868
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,350
Here we go.

869
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,120
(This is a chance for him to end
the match between the anchovies.)

870
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,000
(He's determined to win.)

871
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,830
He's preparing to fall.

872
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,690
- What was that?
- Oh, great.

873
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,160
(His attack was too weak.)

874
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,470
- Gosh. Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae, that was too weak.

875
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,340
- He's so weak.
- My gosh.

876
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,930
- Let's move on.
- Why?

877
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,670
Let's go.

878
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,840
Gosh. Woo Jae.

879
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,910
Cham, cham, cham.

880
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,320
Cham, cham, cham.

881
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,910
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Darn.

882
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,490
Since they jeered at me,

883
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,260
- Okay. Sure.
- please understand me.

884
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,520
- You've done enough to be funny.
- Right.

885
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,330
Finish him now.

886
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,490
There he goes.

887
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,920
(He got another chance
while everyone was laughing at him.)

888
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,800
(Will Anchovy Joo's attack succeed
this time?)

889
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,800
(Jae Suk stumbles.)

890
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,100
- I survived.
- Gosh.

891
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,810
(After an attack with no damage,)

892
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,240
(he fell off the beam.)

893
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,440
He's so weak.

894
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,810
- He's so weak.
- Jae Suk wins.

895
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,080
- Okay!
- What was that?

896
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,110
He's just useless.

897
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,870
Did you do that intentionally
to win him over?

898
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,320
Jae Suk, please choose your team.

899
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,520
But if I choose Team Do Kwon,
the others will join the other team.

900
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,880
If more people choose a team
than they can accept,

901
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,380
the team captain will pick
the members to accept.

902
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,760
- Okay.
- That's a good idea.

903
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,500
- That sounds great.
- We'd be in an awkward position.

904
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,300
- That'd be better.
- Good.

905
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,270
Then Captain Jeon, I'll join
your team if you give me 50 dollars.

906
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,630
- Fifty dollars?
- You have a lot of money.

907
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,100
- If you give me 50 dollars...
- They'll all demand money.

908
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,480
(Contemplating)

909
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,400
- So Min, do you have no pride?
- That's too much. Ten dollars.

910
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,910
- Okay. Give me just ten dollars.
- So Min.

911
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,550
- So Min.
- So Min, wait. We all might...

912
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,750
- join your team.
- Okay.

913
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,490
- Are you buying him?
- Just give me ten dollars.

914
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,110
Is Jae Suk worth the money?

915
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,990
- I bought him.
- I'm on Team So Min.

916
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,180
- Okay.
- Yes.

917
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,490
- Next up are numbers 3 and 4.
- I need him.

918
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,730
I had to recruit a good member.

919
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,150
(Round 2, Se Chan versus Haha)

920
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,190
I'll join that team.

921
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,970
Ten dollars was reasonable.

922
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,470
- Or else, it would hurt.
- Like this.

923
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,690
How painful could it be?

924
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,810
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- It doesn't hurt.

925
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,740
- Right. It doesn't hurt.
- Rock-paper-scissors

926
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,740
- Cham, cham, cham.
- They're having a match after all.

927
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
Cham, cham, cham.

928
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,250
Cham, cham, cham.

929
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,910
Ouch.

930
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,520
(Ouch.)

931
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,380
- He hit my ear.
- It's okay.

932
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,990
- Hey, Se Chan. You can hit him too.
- Does it hurt?

933
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,350
I'm hearing buzzing in my ear.
Is this okay?

934
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,230
- Are you all right?
- Se Chan.

935
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,120
- Hit me with the tip, not the palm.
- Se Chan.

936
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,890
- It's okay.
- Okay.

937
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,890
- You should hit with the palm.
- Oh, okay.

938
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,530
- Are you okay? All right.
- It's bearable.

939
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,890
It's not so bad.

940
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,300
Cham, cham, cham.

941
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

942
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,400
Cham, cham, cham.

943
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,900
(Haha got caught!)

944
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,400
(Se Chan fell off the beam.)

945
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,720
(While trying to hit Haha hard,
he fell on the wrong body part.)

946
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,820
Oh, no. It must hurt.

947
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,490
Hey. My gosh.

948
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,350
- Hey.
- It must hurt.

949
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,110
Hey, why... What just happened?

950
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,120
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

951
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

952
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,230
- Hey, Se Chan.
- Are you okay?

953
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,850
- It must be so painful.
- He fell on it between the legs.

954
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,390
- How did that happen?
- My gosh.

955
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,620
He hasn't gotten married yet.
I feel bad for him.

956
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,800
- Are you okay?
- My gosh.

957
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,130
- What was that?
- Check if you're okay.

958
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,240
- Does it seem okay?
- I'm fine.

959
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,200
- It's okay. He seems fine.
- Are you okay?

960
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,480
- My gosh.
- Check if it's intact.

961
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,170
- I tried to hit him hard.
- Is that allowed?

962
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,900
What a shame.

963
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,820
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

964
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
Hey, Woo Jae, did you see it?

965
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,440
That's how you should've done it.

966
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,550
(He suddenly lectures Woo Jae
on being funny on a variety show.)

967
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,610
- You stood out too much earlier.
- I admit it.

968
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,260
- Right.
- I should choose my team.

969
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,260
Haha, you lost one dollar.
You can choose your team now.

970
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,030
- Give me just ten dollars...
- Sorry?

971
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,120
- Give me ten dollars, and I'll...
- No.

972
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,070
- Haha hasn't chosen his team yet.
- I won't accept you.

973
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,660
- Are you upset with me?
- No. I don't have enough money.

974
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,630
- If you give me three dollars...
- Haha is choosing his team?

975
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Two dollars.

976
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,970
- Two dollars?
- Yes.

977
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,870
- I want to win and join her team...
- Can't you give me ten dollars?

978
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,310
so that I can get ten dollars.

979
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,600
- I chose Team So Min.
- You don't have to give me money.

980
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,840
- Okay. Haha is on Team So Min.
- Yes.

981
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,610
Come here.

982
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,320
Which side is better?

983
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,610
- I won't go easy on you.
- Hey.

984
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,110
Of course, you shouldn't.

985
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,380
- I won't go easy on you either.
- Do you mean that?

986
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,260
You know, right? The world of
variety shows is cold-blooded.

987
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,650
Is it okay for me not to
go easy on you as a senior man?

988
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,120
- You punk.
- Ouch.

989
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,300
(How dare you?)

990
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Why is he hitting Yi Kyung?

991
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,300
When he was eating tteokbokki...

992
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,070
Show him the spicy taste
of tteokbokki.

993
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,340
It's spicy.

994
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,740
- Cham, cham, cham.
- He's good at it.

995
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,400
Cham, cham, cham. What's that?

996
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,540
Suk Jin, come on.

997
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,810
Yi Kyung, you won. Hit him.

998
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,810
- No.
- Come here.

999
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,370
- You can hit him.
- Hit him.

1000
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,550
- Wait.
- Hold your nose, Suk Jin.

1001
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,480
- Wait.
- You'll hear buzzing in your ear.

1002
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,640
- Look at him. Yi Kyung.
- That's not fair.

1003
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,380
- Why? What's wrong?
- Why did he hit Yi Kyung?

1004
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,820
What's going on? Did he win?

1005
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,290
- What's going on?
- Why did he hit Yi Kyung?

1006
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,380
- He hit Yi Kyung...
- Take this!

1007
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,790
- Why did he hit Yi Kyung?
- Take this!

1008
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,590
He's falling off.

1009
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,950
- He hit Yi Kyung...
- Take this!

1010
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,230
(He lost at one blow.)

1011
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
He said...

1012
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
Good job.

1013
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,010
Yi Kyung wins.

1014
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,310
(Seok Sam got knocked down
by Yi Kyung in the end.)

1015
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,430
Good job.

1016
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,700
- You did well.
- That was good.

1017
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,010
- Oh, gosh.
- Are you okay?

1018
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,170
- I joined Team So Min.
- Give me just one dollar.

1019
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,010
- Haha hit me like this earlier.
- Here we go.

1020
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,980
- He hit me in the neck too.
- Oh, we met again.

1021
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,750
- "Love Me Actually."
- "Love Me Actually."

1022
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,820
("Love Me Actually")

1023
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,640
- Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors

1024
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,850
Okay.

1025
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,450
- Cham, cham, cham.
- It's too long.

1026
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,120
- I fell because I moved like this.
- It's over.

1027
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,350
Oh, no. It's over.

1028
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,590
- Woo Jae will fall off. Oh, no.
- I fell because I moved like this.

1029
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,090
- Se Chan, make him fall off.
- Go for it.

1030
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,500
Hit him.

1031
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,240
(He's wide awake.)

1032
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,700
He's taken aback.

1033
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,600
- That was loud.
- It's okay, Woo Jae.

1034
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,810
- That was good.
- Woo Jae.

1035
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,810
- It's good.
- Can you see?

1036
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,100
- He just provoked Woo Jae.
- It was good.

1037
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,510
- Are your eyes okay?
- He just provoked Woo Jae.

1038
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,550
Woo Jae, you're okay, right?

1039
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,640
- That's normal.
- I'm fine. My gosh.

1040
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,820
- I'm ready.
- Cham, cham, cham.

1041
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,090
- Okay. It's my turn.
- Finally.

1042
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,110
Cham, cham, cham.

1043
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,520
- Cham, cham, cham.
- Okay.

1044
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,530
- That's good.
- He got a chance.

1045
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,450
(Core Joo finally got a chance
to attack.)

1046
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,120
- Hit him with the palm.
- Se Chan rarely falls off.

1047
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,190
- Go ahead.
- Hit him with the palm.

1048
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,590
- He won't fall if you use the tip.
- Hit him hard.

1049
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,810
(Will he show
how strong his core is this time?)

1050
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,810
- Okay. Good.
- He missed.

1051
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,200
My goodness.

1052
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,870
Okay. That's good.

1053
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,010
Keep going.

1054
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,820
That's a good strategy.

1055
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,990
Okay.

1056
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,490
- Keep going.
- You're doing great.

1057
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,110
- That's his strategy.
- Hold out.

1058
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,220
- That's his strategy.
- Okay.

1059
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,620
- That was funny.
- That's his strategy.

1060
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,880
I will never fall down.

1061
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

1062
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,190
- It's my turn.
- They're so strong.

1063
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,620
I see that "Love Me Actually"
made them like sworn enemies.

1064
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,270
- Indeed.
- It's my turn to attack.

1065
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,500
- Cham, cham, cham.
- My gosh.

1066
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,690
- He's going to get hit again.
- Wait. Okay. I'm ready.

1067
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,970
- Hit him right now!
- Shake it, Se Chan.

1068
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,840
In the opposite direction.

1069
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,970
Like this?
I should hit him like this.

1070
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,340
- Where?
- A chop in the neck.

1071
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,640
- I don't think that'll work.
- Go for it.

1072
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,010
(Will Woo Jae be able
to ride it out again?)

1073
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,780
You're getting smacked around today.

1074
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,550
The one that is loved is me!

1075
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,990
You won.

1076
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,050
Se Chan won.

1077
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,260
You lost three dollars.

1078
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,760
I'll join Team Do Kwon.

1079
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,730
(After losing 3 dollars,
Se Chan joins Team Do Kwon.)

1080
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,850
My chances are better here.

1081
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,230
You're being smacked around.

1082
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,920
- For the final round...
- Yes?

1083
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,500
It'll be a free-for-all match.

1084
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,270
Knock him down with jabs.

1085
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,840
His legs will easily give in.

1086
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,360
The old man's legs
will easily give in.

1087
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
(After non-threatening jabs)

1088
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,660
(Suk Jin loses due to
his weaker core strength.)

1089
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,200
- Woo Jae wins.
- This...

1090
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,430
It's easier on that side.
I want a rematch.

1091
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,080
- It's easier on your side.
- A rematch?

1092
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,840
Woo Jae wins.

1093
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,980
He will choose a team...

1094
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,670
which will send Suk Jin
to the opposite team.

1095
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,680
- Either one of them...
- I'm pretty sure...

1096
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,550
that no one will offer me any money.

1097
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,520
- Of course.
- Try placing a deal though.

1098
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,680
- So Min might be willing to pay.
- Offer her a deal.

1099
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,060
Woo Jae, she might
give you five dollars.

1100
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,150
I'll offer you two dollars.

1101
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,890
- Get lost.
- How about ten dollars?

1102
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,030
- Here.
- What?

1103
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Okay!

1104
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,890
- Two dollars?
- I'm glad you're here.

1105
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:33,920
- Do you know how much I have?
- We're good.

1106
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,390
Two dollars wasn't enough.

1107
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,240
Two dollars after
all the beating I took?

1108
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
Tell me about it.

1109
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,100
You should at least get ten dollars.

1110
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,240
This is spacious.

1111
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,510
- I knew things would get physical.
- Nice.

1112
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,840
Our team is well-balanced.

1113
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,020
Things would've been bad
if Yi Kyung was on that team.

1114
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,110
Come this way.

1115
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,320
We would've had a hard time
even with Woo Jae on our team.

1116
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,340
Woo Jae thinks
he's the strongest on our team.

1117
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,820
- Who?
- Look at Woo Jae.

1118
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,230
- He's shadowboxing.
- Let him have his fun.

1119
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,760
Think of him as
a taller version of Hwang Kwang Hee.

1120
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,300
- Hwang Kwang Hee?
- Right.

1121
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,450
A paper doll.

1122
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,830
This next game is called...

1123
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,000
Arithmetic One-legged Fight Rumble.

1124
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,160
We're supposed to do math?

1125
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,090
- I'm bad at that though.
- All right.

1126
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,600
You will decide an order
for the players.

1127
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:18,600
The first players will face off
in a one-legged fight.

1128
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,340
The next player...

1129
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,940
will sit on both sides
and solve a simple math question...

1130
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,750
- in their heads.
- In our heads?

1131
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,350
- In our heads?
- In our heads?

1132
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,720
How difficult are the equations?

1133
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,390
- In our heads?
- Yes, in your heads.

1134
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,990
I'm really bad at that.

1135
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,450
(None of them are good
at arithmetic.)

1136
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,760
I'm bad at arithmetic.

1137
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,220
But I didn't major in
math or science.

1138
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,760
- Does it include factorial?
- I bet it's long.

1139
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,300
- Just because you studied math.
- Don't get cheeky.

1140
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,930
- He studied math and science.
- Please include factorial.

1141
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,800
- Factorial?
- Try including some muscles...

1142
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,570
in your buttocks instead.

1143
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,300
They're flat.

1144
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,950
- Don't leave your buttocks at home.
- Him...

1145
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,570
Quickly solving the questions...

1146
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,140
- is how we can enter the ring.
- That's the way to do it.

1147
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,990
First of all, please decide on
an order for your players.

1148
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,950
The first one in the ring
has to stay there.

1149
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,050
- Yes.
- Right?

1150
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,160
Isn't it better
for you to go last...

1151
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,820
- and wipe everyone out?
- Yes, it is.

1152
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,160
- Do Kwon will go first.
- Right.

1153
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,390
- Se Chan and you will go last.
- He'll be third.

1154
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,890
We won't be able to enter the ring.

1155
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,100
We need to answer it correctly
to enter the ring.

1156
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,430
What's our best option
if we are to win?

1157
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,470
This...

1158
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,660
We don't have a chance.

1159
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,070
Guys, allow me
to lift up your spirits.

1160
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,640
My gosh. Really?

1161
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
(She gives them money.)

1162
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,280
- Ms. So Min.
- Please do a good job.

1163
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
Thank you.

1164
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,180
- Please do your best.
- This is great.

1165
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,510
Thank you.

1166
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,090
I don't have any change,
so I'll get back to you.

1167
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,280
- Ms. So Min...
- She...

1168
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,620
Ms. So Min can be quite impulsive.

1169
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,890
- I'll get back to you.
- She's a big spender.

1170
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,320
- Don't forget me later on.
- I won't.

1171
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,530
Let me ask you this. Multiplying...

1172
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,200
Multiplying comes first, right?

1173
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,890
He said arithmetic.

1174
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,030
Let me tell you how it'll be.

1175
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,430
- How will it be?
- Plus, minus, multiply, or divide.

1176
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,160
That's all you need to do.

1177
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,780
- Do you know what this is?
- Multiplying comes first.

1178
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,840
Yes, multiplying.

1179
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,780
Is this the number three?

1180
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,950
- What is it?
- Fleming's Left Hand Rule.

1181
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,820
- Fleming. Like this.
- Who?

1182
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,910
Fleming's Left Hand Rule.

1183
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,140
- But this...
- You should know this.

1184
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,320
What does this mean?

1185
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,450
Plus, minus, and multiply.

1186
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,550
(Directions of force
in a magnetic field)

1187
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,180
Se Chan, you might
be sitting there forever.

1188
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,780
Plus, minus, and multiply.

1189
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,930
Do you know the Plank's Rule?

1190
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,180
(Do you know the Plank's Rule?)

1191
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,390
- The Plank's Rule.
- That's not it.

1192
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,390
- The plank is an exercise.
- Fleming's Left Hand Rule.

1193
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,490
Yes, Fleming's Left Hand Rule.

1194
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,660
It's Fleming, not Plank.

1195
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,740
The Plank's Rule?

1196
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,660
We should be glad
he knows anything at all.

1197
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,010
- Fleming...
- You're right.

1198
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,680
- Here is the list of matches.
- Sure thing.

1199
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,470
First up...

1200
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,350
are Do Kwon and Yi Kyung.

1201
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,550
- Yi Kyung, can you do this?
- This is bad.

1202
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,640
- He seems athletic.
- It's fine.

1203
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,890
Just lay him out.

1204
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,680
Yi Kyung, take your time
and let me join you.

1205
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,120
- Yi Kyung, good luck.
- Got it.

1206
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,280
I'll take my time.

1207
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,890
The first players
will take their positions.

1208
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,530
Ji Hyo and Jae Suk,
please take your seats.

1209
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,220
Let's do this.

1210
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,720
- So Min, you...
- Get ready.

1211
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,160
(Go!)

1212
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,700
I'm doomed.

1213
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,470
All right. That's 52.

1214
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,800
That's 52...

1215
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,180
Let's ride it out
until the others join us.

1216
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,180
- Shall we?
- Isn't that better?

1217
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,200
Sure, let's do that.

1218
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,570
Why bother, right?

1219
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:13,910
(Her brain is at full power.)

1220
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,950
That's 52. With 2, that is 4.

1221
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,120
Multiplied, it's 1,000.

1222
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,260
Can't I write it down somewhere?

1223
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,550
It's hard to stand on one leg,

1224
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,370
- so I'll approach you for now.
- Please don't.

1225
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,390
(Charging forward)

1226
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,390
I'll approach you for now.

1227
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,640
I'm finding it hard
to keep my balance.

1228
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,100
(Sprinting)

1229
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,410
(Yi Kyung swiftly runs away.)

1230
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,180
You're quite fast.

1231
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,140
Do Kwon, don't chase after him.

1232
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,640
- I can't catch him on my own.
- Right, you need help.

1233
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,850
(The game won't end
if it's 1 against 1.)

1234
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,950
Is it 1,072?

1235
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,950
Is it 1,072?

1236
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,220
(Incorrect)

1237
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,430
Is it 306?

1238
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,470
- Is it 306?
- That is incorrect.

1239
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,030
Is it 320?

1240
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,470
- Is it 320?
- You can't lean on that!

1241
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,430
(Incorrect)

1242
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,780
Roar.

1243
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,910
(Do Kwon tries to take him on.)

1244
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,970
- Hop away from him.
- Don't chase him, Do Kwon.

1245
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,510
Seriously?

1246
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,350
- Hop away from him.
- Don't chase him, Do Kwon.

1247
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,510
Seriously?

1248
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,820
Are you kidding me?

1249
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,680
- Hop away from him.
- Don't chase him, Do Kwon.

1250
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,720
Seriously? Are you kidding me?

1251
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,930
- What's with you?
- What did I tell you?

1252
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,300
- What happened?
- I told you not to chase him.

1253
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,490
Guys, hurry up.

1254
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,660
(They trusted Do Kwon,
but he got eliminated.)

1255
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,990
Someone has to get in here.

1256
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,070
(The correct answer)

1257
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,370
Is it 233?

1258
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,070
(Incorrect)

1259
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,300
- What now?
- Who knows?

1260
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,430
- Hurry.
- Just a second.

1261
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,800
- That's 52...
- Lean on that.

1262
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,640
- I'm dying over here.
- Is it 1,092?

1263
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,350
- Is it 1,092?
- That is correct.

1264
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,720
Okay, get in here.

1265
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,820
Come on, Jae Suk.
Let's stand in front of her.

1266
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,450
Yi Kyung, over here.

1267
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,010
- Suk Jin.
- Am I next?

1268
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,760
(Seok Sam's next.)

1269
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,780
So 23...

1270
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,530
Is it 323?

1271
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,820
- Is that right?
- Woo Jae, you're next.

1272
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,100
- Woo Jae, you're next.
- Hurry.

1273
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,720
- What the...
- Get in here.

1274
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Hold on.

1275
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,820
- Hurry.
- Okay, fine.

1276
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,800
- Stand in the middle.
- At least be in the middle.

1277
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,260
- Come on.
- Get them from the inside.

1278
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,370
Target them from the inside.

1279
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,030
(The science major
receives his math problem.)

1280
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,600
- Go ahead.
- Hurry.

1281
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,840
Jae Suk, be merciless.

1282
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,470
- Be careful.
- Don't lose this match.

1283
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,180
That's 78...

1284
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,470
Jae Suk, be merciless.

1285
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,220
- Be careful.
- Don't lose this match.

1286
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,680
- Why you...
- Next!

1287
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,740
Next! Bring it on.

1288
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,390
(Ji Hyo is eliminated.)

1289
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,550
(They are dominating
the playground.)

1290
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,160
Lean on each other.

1291
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,600
Let's take a break.

1292
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,660
Let's wait.

1293
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,160
So with 180 and 16...

1294
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,840
Se Chan, don't help...
No, nevermind.

1295
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,340
"Nevermind?"

1296
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,840
What do you mean by that?

1297
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,010
Is it 288?

1298
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,100
- Okay, come on.
- Bring it on.

1299
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,140
(The science major is in the ring.)

1300
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,950
Lay him out flat.

1301
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,370
(Meanwhile, the business major...)

1302
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,140
No, that's not it. 700...

1303
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,240
That's 780.

1304
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,320
Lay him out flat.

1305
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,050
(It's currently 2 against 1.)

1306
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,590
Okay, I have 340.

1307
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,160
And then 12...

1308
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:12,050
(Se Chan needs to join them
to level out the playing field.)

1309
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,240
(Jae Suk attacks,
but Woo Jae holds his ground.)

1310
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,470
Woo Jae, nice!

1311
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,530
(Jae Suk attacks,
but Woo Jae holds his ground.)

1312
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,370
(The paper doll
is sturdier than expected.)

1313
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,010
Is it 897?

1314
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,640
(Correct)

1315
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,510
Suk Jin, eliminate him.

1316
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,780
(Suk Jin joins the fight!)

1317
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,910
Keep going for now.
I'll join you soon.

1318
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,510
- Come on.
- Bring it on!

1319
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,680
- Don't pressure yourself.
- What's happening?

1320
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,220
Se Chan, this is an easy one.

1321
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,680
Keep going.

1322
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,850
Don't pressure yourself.

1323
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,070
Bring it on.

1324
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,570
(It's as if Se Chan spotted
a major mathematical flaw.)

1325
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,240
Se Chan, hurry!

1326
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,140
Is it 740?

1327
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,800
Is it 840?

1328
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,800
(Wrong and wrong again)

1329
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:01,350
(Whimpering)

1330
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,870
(Will it help if he looks at it
from a distance?)

1331
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,140
Can't I get a pen?

1332
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,320
That's 8 and 64.

1333
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,550
Bring it on.

1334
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,680
(Woo Jae is now surrounded.)

1335
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,010
Se Chan, this is an easy one.

1336
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,450
(Woo Jae is now surrounded.)

1337
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,820
We forced him off the ring.

1338
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,100
See?

1339
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,300
We forced him off the ring.

1340
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,390
(Woo Jae has been eliminated.)

1341
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,530
Okay.

1342
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,930
What on earth is this?

1343
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,160
- He stepped on this.
- What is this?

1344
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,910
We've got this.

1345
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,410
- Guys, huddle up.
- What on earth is this?

1346
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,950
Huddle up and lean on each other.

1347
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,800
Lean on each other.

1348
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,050
Lean on one another.

1349
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,220
(They come together
to save their energy.)

1350
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,590
Unbelievable.

1351
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,850
What's taking you so long?

1352
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,910
(They're exhausting their energy.)

1353
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,120
Is it 188?

1354
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,890
Is it 188?

1355
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,200
- Hurry.
- Hurry up, darn it!

1356
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,620
That's 2 and 7. And that's 3.

1357
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,200
- So 40...
- That's 2.

1358
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,530
- And 7.
- Then 4...

1359
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,660
You're confusing me.

1360
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,840
(This is confusing!)

1361
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,470
Se Chan still hasn't been able
to solve his.

1362
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,240
I know the answer.

1363
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,740
Is it 407?

1364
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,840
- Is it 408?
- Hurry out here.

1365
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,800
- He's here.
- Is he?

1366
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,680
- Okay, here we go.
- He's here.

1367
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,120
He's coming at us, isn't he?

1368
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,050
(Se Chan decides to take them on.)

1369
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,180
- Is it my turn?
- Get him!

1370
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,910
(Jong Kook's the last player
for Team Do Kwon.)

1371
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,660
- You've got this.
- You can take your time.

1372
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,120
This is an easy one.

1373
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,200
Okay, I'll take it slow.

1374
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,300
(They might turn things around
if Jong Kook manages to join them.)

1375
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,100
But...

1376
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,300
(It wasn't easy,
but he got his moment in the ring.)

1377
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,470
Run him over, guys.

1378
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,870
(They come at Se Chan all at once.)

1379
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,510
Suk Jin lost his strength.

1380
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,200
Suk Jin lost his strength.

1381
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,470
(Falling)

1382
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,680
What's with him?

1383
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,050
You need to hurry.

1384
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,050
(Seok Sam's legs give out,
making him fall.)

1385
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,990
(What's with him?)

1386
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,450
Guys! We can take our time.

1387
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,990
It's hard to stand on one leg
for a long time.

1388
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,550
What's the answer? Hold on.

1389
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,570
- Oh, gosh.
- What was that?

1390
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,200
What was that?

1391
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,530
We need to get rid of him fast.

1392
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,800
You'll fall if you stay like that
for too long.

1393
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,160
What was that?

1394
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,470
(His foot got stuck
between the mats.)

1395
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,970
- Goodness.
- What was that?

1396
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,070
- Se Chan!
- My foot got stuck!

1397
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,140
(Everyone
got eliminated in an instant.)

1398
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,950
- We won.
- He beat everyone.

1399
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,950
(They won without doing anything.)

1400
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,320
- My foot got stuck.
- Someone pushed me!

1401
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:27,160
Someone pushed me!

1402
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,530
- What was that?
- Hey!

1403
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,320
My foot got stuck!

1404
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,990
Darn it!

1405
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,720
We're done for!

1406
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,300
(Lost all his will to fight)

1407
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,370
- I'm sorry. My foot got stuck.
- We were so close!

1408
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,160
- Is it 1,435?
- Good.

1409
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,140
Is it correct? All right.

1410
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,510
We got it. You can set off now.

1411
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,070
- It's so annoying!
- We're doomed.

1412
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,740
- We could've won.
- How could you...

1413
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,050
Is it 432?

1414
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,680
- Sorry?
- Is it 432?

1415
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,180
All right. Come here, So Min.

1416
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,390
(All right. Come here, So Min.)

1417
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,910
It's okay. Haha can join her.

1418
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,120
So Min has to face him.

1419
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,780
- Help me.
- Okay.

1420
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,660
- Because of this...
- The mat is the hard part.

1421
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,930
- The mat is the hard part.
- It is.

1422
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:04,930
That's right.

1423
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,120
- Hold on.
- Hold on. Gosh.

1424
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:07,660
What do I do?

1425
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,300
Hold on. Here we go.

1426
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,370
All right.

1427
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,990
Come on in, So Min.

1428
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,600
- So it's 2 times 9... It's 218.
- It's 211.

1429
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,370
It's 211.

1430
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,600
Haha should solve it.

1431
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,140
- It's hard.
- Go for 211.

1432
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,970
- She's done for.
- You can just fall.

1433
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,450
- So Min is done for.
- Just sit there, So Min.

1434
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,350
- It's 2 times 9...
- So it's 240...

1435
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,390
- Hurry up! I'm exhausted!
- Is it 198?

1436
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,260
- Hurry up!
- It's 228.

1437
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,850
- It's 228.
- So Min is done for.

1438
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,260
Darn it!

1439
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,530
- It's 228.
- I'm exhausted.

1440
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,200
So Min is done for.

1441
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,800
(Falling)

1442
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,840
- Hey!
- What am I supposed to do?

1443
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,200
What was that?

1444
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,700
So Bal!

1445
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,740
(He has to face Jong Kook
and Ssaeb Ssaeb.)

1446
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,370
Hey, just go for it. You can do it.

1447
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,010
- Go for it.
- You're So Wool's father.

1448
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,800
- I'll throw myself at them.
- They will get tired too.

1449
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,220
I'll give you two dollars this time.

1450
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,570
Crush them.

1451
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,120
I'll give you two dollars this time.

1452
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,780
(Stepping on to the mat
with a weird shout)

1453
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,950
- Bring it on.
- Gosh, that guy.

1454
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,050
- Great. Don't go to them.
- Bring it on!

1455
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,820
No, just go.
You need to make them fall.

1456
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,430
(Screaming)

1457
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,760
- Oh, gosh.
- Don't go to them!

1458
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,990
(He steps back, all scared.)

1459
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:15,430
- Make them come.
- Let's wait.

1460
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:16,740
Can they stand with shoulders
around each other?

1461
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,240
(It's a match between two hyenas
and Haha.)

1462
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,840
- We lost.
- You'll fall at that rate.

1463
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,370
The moment you go to them,
you'll get a taste of the fiery pit.

1464
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,240
Gosh. Let me stand with you guys.

1465
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,910
Hold me.

1466
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,470
- Rest for now.
- Rest for now?

1467
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,410
- Let's finish it at once.
- Go away first.

1468
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:31,910
- Let me rest for a bit more.
- Let go of me.

1469
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,740
- Let me rest for a bit more.
- Leave him be.

1470
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,620
Just for a while.

1471
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,050
Go!

1472
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,490
Come at me!

1473
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,180
Darn it.

1474
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,100
Please come at me!

1475
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,320
- While smiling.
- We'll watch you fall alone.

1476
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,820
Come at us!

1477
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,300
Come at us!

1478
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,660
What is he doing all by himself?

1479
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,530
(Complaining about the pain
in his thigh)

1480
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,870
What is he doing all by himself?

1481
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,970
(The game ends
with Haha destroying himself.)

1482
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,200
What was that?

1483
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,280
- All right!
- Why did he fall by himself?

1484
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,510
Why did you...

1485
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,180
What were you doing?

1486
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,320
- Help me.
- He's so weak.

1487
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,590
- That was hilarious.
- How embarrassing!

1488
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:12,450
I mean, what were you doing there
all alone?

1489
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,260
Hey, you couldn't even put up...

1490
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,050
- What was that?
- a good fight.

1491
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,450
Give me back the dollar I gave you.

1492
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:18,760
- Haha.
- Give back the dollar I gave you.

1493
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,970
- My foot got stuck here.
- But it was so hard for me.

1494
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,220
My foot got stuck here.

1495
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,260
- So that's what happened.
- My foot got stuck.

1496
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,340
I knew we wouldn't be a match,
but we couldn't even win once.

1497
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,800
Gosh, the game was disadvantageous
for us.

1498
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,300
Everyone, the winning team can win
as much as 50 dollars.

1499
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,640
The losing team can win
as much as 30 dollars.

1500
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,870
- Us?
- Since there are five people,

1501
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,780
the top two
won't get the prize money.

1502
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,220
The top two won't get it?

1503
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,720
Let's reveal
the winning team's first. One, two,

1504
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,950
- three, open!
- Let's see.

1505
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:45,950
(50 dollars)

1506
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,280
Open!

1507
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,550
I told you to lower it.

1508
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,050
- All right.
- I wrote 23 dollars.

1509
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:54,070
(Woo Jae wrote 21 dollars.)

1510
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:56,340
Those who wrote 50 and 48 dollars
are eliminated.

1511
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,390
What about us?

1512
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:00,160
(Do Kwon, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo
were all eliminated.)

1513
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,370
Woo Jae won 21 dollars.

1514
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:02,430
The "Love Me Actually" team.

1515
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,030
- "Love Me Actually!"
- "Love Me Actually!"

1516
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
- All right! Us?
- It's your turn.

1517
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,680
In 1, 2, 3. Open!

1518
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,910
I wrote 23 dollars.

1519
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,470
- You wrote 19 dollars?
- Yes.

1520
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:13,740
I wrote 12 dollars.

1521
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,280
(So Min wrote 14 dollars.)

1522
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,850
- You wrote 19 dollars?
- Yes.

1523
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,760
Those who wrote 23 and 20 dollars
are eliminated.

1524
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,390
(Jae Suk and Suk Jin get nothing.)

1525
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,390
You failed!

1526
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,700
- You wrote 12 dollars?
- Wait a minute.

1527
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,720
- You wrote 14 dollars?
- So Min, how much did you write?

1528
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,140
- I wrote 14 dollars.
- She's one funny woman.

1529
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,140
- She's so bad.
- It's not that.

1530
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,640
Give us the money first.

1531
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,760
(Only So Min, Haha, and Yi Kyung
won the money.)

1532
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,010
I wanted to give you a dollar each.

1533
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,780
- Is that so?
- I meant to give you a dollar each.

1534
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,740
You want to keep us
under your influence, don't you?

1535
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,120
- That's right, Jae Suk.
- Right?

1536
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,240
It seems like So Min wants to
keep us under her influence.

1537
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,120
- Give me some money.
- How much do you have?

1538
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,260
- You spent 30 dollars?
- I only have 2.5 dollars.

1539
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,180
- You have 2.5 dollars?
- I wanted to increase it.

1540
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,030
- You should've lowered the number.
- Please give me a dollar.

1541
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:57,990
- Why?
- Aren't they counting it?

1542
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:00,220
I earned two dollars
because they pitied me.

1543
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,820
Is it okay to give it out?

1544
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,570
- You should donate some to me too.
- You got an allowance?

1545
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,490
- All right?
- I don't have much either, but...

1546
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:06,530
You do have a lot.

1547
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,010
- An allowance?
- I'm in the upper rank.

1548
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,910
- No, still...
- You can take four dollars.

1549
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,410
- How much do you have?
- I have only three dollars.

1550
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,550
I should have won.

1551
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,010
Use this for your taxi fare.

1552
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,620
What? That's money too!

1553
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,120
Use this for your taxi fare.

1554
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,450
(Suk Jin, who is too proud,
refuses to take 10 cents.)

1555
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,090
Ten cents are considered money too.

1556
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,530
- How could he give me ten cents?
- Ten cents.

1557
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,780
It's considered money too.

1558
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,390
- You're the reason...
- I'll collect them one by one.

1559
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,930
they look down on me.

1560
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,220
Then you should give me some too.

1561
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,800
Ji Hyo. Oh, you're not Ji Hyo.

1562
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,700
- Jae Suk.
- Ji Hyo.

1563
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,890
(Fluttering)

1564
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,700
(The members of Running Man world
cry and laugh because of R money.)

1565
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,910
Ten cents is too little.

1566
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,140
You're too annoying.

1567
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,450
It's nice to have ten cents,
at least.

1568
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,820
- I wouldn't accept it.
- Tables could be turned...

1569
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,140
because of ten cents.

1570
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,090
The three of us never...

1571
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,720
We didn't even win once.

1572
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,550
- The three of us...
- Why am I so exhausted?

1573
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,430
- We started with no money.
- We never won once.

1574
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:03,700
I'm so exhausted too.

1575
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,030
You guys did your best, though.

1576
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,470
I'm seriously doing my best.

1577
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:10,030
All right. The last mission
is foot volleyball.

1578
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,390
It's Option Foot Volleyball
we're proud of.

1579
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,410
Option Foot Volleyball?

1580
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,910
It's our style of foot volleyball...

1581
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,410
- with different options.
- We're aware of that.

1582
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,280
It'll be a 4-on-4 game,

1583
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,700
and the remaining players
will be a substitute.

1584
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,280
You can substitute players
all you want.

1585
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:24,010
The opponent team can decide
two players...

1586
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,390
who'll constantly be playing.

1587
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,010
- Really?
- Two members from each team...

1588
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,220
will be fixed players.

1589
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,850
- We'll choose for each other?
- And the three remaining players...

1590
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,450
can be substituted among themselves.

1591
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:33,990
So Min and I will be fixed players
for sure.

1592
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:37,260
There will be different options
for each round.

1593
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,700
If you don't follow the option,
the opponent wins a point.

1594
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,700
Your point won't get deducted.
They'll win a point instead.

1595
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,070
Here's the option for Round One.

1596
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:48,370
Making the sound the opponent set
every time you touch the ball.

1597
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,200
- What?
- Let's say this team decided...

1598
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,600
on a certain sound.

1599
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,600
Each time you touch the ball,
you need to make that sound.

1600
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,050
That sounds fun. If they decided...

1601
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,280
on this sound,

1602
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,510
then we have to make the same sound?

1603
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,450
- "Aya!"
- I still haven't gotten over...

1604
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,050
the sound Bo Mi made.

1605
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,700
(The sound Bo Mi made is
still ringing in Jae Suk's head.)

1606
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,990
- Then we'll pick "Nah."
- "Nah."

1607
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,220
The moaning sound.

1608
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,760
- It's allowed.
- Is it? All right.

1609
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,890
- The moaning sound.
- It could be worse too.

1610
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:19,740
That's the option for Round One.

1611
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,930
It'll be a game to win 36 points
in total.

1612
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,010
While playing the game,
if one team earns 12 points first,

1613
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,370
we'll move on to Round Two,
and the option will be changed.

1614
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,010
If one team earns 24 points,

1615
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,090
we'll move on to Round Three,
and the option will be changed.

1616
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,140
The team that reaches
36 points first will win.

1617
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,320
Got it.

1618
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,050
The option for Round Two
is informal talk.

1619
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,490
- Informal talk?
- If you talk formally,

1620
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:42,820
- the opponent wins a point.
- All right. Sounds good.

1621
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,620
The option for Round Two
is not getting upset.

1622
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,370
- It's been a while.
- We're good at that.

1623
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:49,890
- That's what we're good at.
- Staying positive.

1624
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:50,990
No cursing or getting mad.

1625
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,240
I've never gotten mad at someone
in my life.

1626
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,300
- Of course.
- Suk Jin is at risk.

1627
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,370
First, choose two fixed players
for this team.

1628
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,070
And do the same for the other team.

1629
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:00,910
- It'll be Ji Hyo and Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae.

1630
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,870
It'll be So Min and Suk Jin.

1631
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,510
- We knew it.
- We knew it too.

1632
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,320
- They knew it themselves.
- We knew it too.

1633
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,320
I knew it'd be you and me.

1634
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,260
Please decide the sound
for Round One.

1635
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,390
(They'll decide the sound
the opponent team will make.)

1636
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,820
- What could it be?
- You can change it in the middle.

1637
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,890
- You can change it in the middle.
- We can?

1638
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,800
How about this?
The one that Yeong Goo made.

1639
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,820
"Hello."

1640
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,930
Sounds good. "Hello."

1641
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,300
- "Hello." We'll go with this.
- We'll go with this.

1642
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,530
- "Hello."
- Every time you touch the ball,

1643
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:29,780
say, "Hello."

1644
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,300
- "Hello."
- "Hello."

1645
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,300
- "Hello."
- It's easy.

1646
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,740
- "Hello."
- "Yeong Goo is not here."

1647
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,070
- "Hello."
- What about this one?

1648
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,510
The one Yeong Goo said.

1649
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,240
We'll just go with the one
we came up with earlier.

1650
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,680
- The moaning sound.
- "Nah."

1651
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,260
- "Nah."
- Try it.

1652
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,390
- "Nah."
- "Nah."

1653
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,010
"Nah." Like this?

1654
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,350
- That's right.
- He's good at it.

1655
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,930
You try saying "hello."

1656
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,550
"Hello." Does it go like this?

1657
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,070
(He has surpassed his teachers.)

1658
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,070
- "Hello."
- How come you're so good at it?

1659
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,340
- Ji Hyo, you try it.
- It suits him.

1660
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,970
- "Hello." Of course I'm good.
- You're good.

1661
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,240
Strangely, as you say it,

1662
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,930
- you kick clumsily too.
- I know.

1663
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,740
- "Hello."
- You try saying "Nah."

1664
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,450
- "Nah."
- We don't need to do the gesture?

1665
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,950
"Nah."

1666
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,010
- That's it.
- No.

1667
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,820
- That's exactly it.
- Right?

1668
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,950
- Do Kwon, you try it.
- Say "Hello."

1669
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,640
- Say "Hello."
- "Hello."

1670
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,990
He's good because he's an actor.

1671
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,990
- He's good.
- My real name is Yong Gu.

1672
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,890
- Oh, right. He's Yong Gu.
- I see.

1673
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,820
Please stand in position
including the fixed players.

1674
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,930
(It's time to play foot volleyball.)

1675
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,200
There you go, Suk Jin.

1676
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,340
Kick it higher.

1677
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,800
(Jae Suk is only good
during practice.)

1678
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,260
You need to keep making the sound.

1679
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,340
"Nah." This one?

1680
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,640
Nah.

1681
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,370
(Knee kick)

1682
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:44,470
(Suk Jin is in good condition.)

1683
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,050
Aren't you supposed to say "Hello?"

1684
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,620
Where did the ball go?

1685
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,550
Are you all ready?

1686
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,720
Serve the ball outside the court.

1687
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,030
- Okay.
- Shall we begin?

1688
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,800
Please say "Hello" with passion.

1689
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,550
- Hello.
- Don't say it half-heartedly.

1690
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:00,100
- Say "Nah."
- Hello.

1691
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,720
- Hello.
- Serve the ball. Nice.

1692
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,740
Hello. Here I go.

1693
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,570
Hello.

1694
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:08,160
- It's out.
- Okay.

1695
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,370
(It's immediately out.)

1696
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,370
- Let's go.
- Oh, my gosh.

1697
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,010
- Okay.
- It's 1 to 0.

1698
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,070
(Team So Min that scored first
will serve.)

1699
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:16,970
- That's right.
- Hello.

1700
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,370
- Good.
- Hello.

1701
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:19,450
- Say nah.
- It's my ball.

1702
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,850
- Nah.
- Come on.

1703
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:22,910
Nah.

1704
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,390
Come on.

1705
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,990
(He showed the 1st slapstick
of the season.)

1706
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:28,550
But we can't take him out.

1707
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:29,890
- Serve the ball.
- We can't take Suk Jin out.

1708
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,800
- I'm sorry.
- Just think you're not playing.

1709
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,260
I'm sorry.

1710
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,370
Give me just one more chance.

1711
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,100
Just one more chance.

1712
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,470
- Let Se Chan serve the ball.
- Give me one more chance.

1713
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,970
- Try it. Okay.
- Okay.

1714
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,660
When will I play volleyball
anywhere else?

1715
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,660
All right.

1716
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,020
Hello.

1717
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,520
- Hello.
- I'll take it.

1718
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,160
- Nah.
- Okay.

1719
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,290
Kick it over the net.

1720
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,000
- Nah. Oh, gosh. It was too strong.
- It's out.

1721
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
- Okay.
- It's out.

1722
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,210
It was too strong.

1723
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,830
- Good.
- I'll kick it over the net...

1724
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:58,910
- if you kick it high.
- I know.

1725
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:00,270
- Woo Jae, that was nice.
- Jae Suk.

1726
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,440
You should say nah.

1727
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,940
- Did I not do it?
- You stopped...

1728
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,350
- in the middle.
- Nah.

1729
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:05,980
- Nah.
- We made a good choice.

1730
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,790
- Nah.
- It's funny.

1731
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,690
- Hello.
- Nah.

1732
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,390
- What?
- Nah.

1733
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,390
- What?
- It's out.

1734
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,830
It's out.

1735
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,190
- It's safe.
- Didn't it touch the line?

1736
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,330
- It's safe.
- It went out.

1737
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:18,790
- It's out.
- It's out.

1738
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,060
- Isn't it safe?
- It's out.

1739
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,660
It touched the line a little.

1740
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,330
- It totally went out.
- It touched a little.

1741
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,160
- Misters.
- It touched a little.

1742
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,540
Why did you slap my face?

1743
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,060
- It touched a little.
- It completely went out.

1744
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,160
What are you talking about?

1745
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,730
It touched a little.

1746
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,180
It touched a little.

1747
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,500
- It touched a little.
- It touched a little.

1748
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,180
Did you just touch him?

1749
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,640
(It touched the line a little.)

1750
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,980
(They realized the situation
belatedly.)

1751
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,790
- Is it allowed?
- Why?

1752
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,580
- I'm sorry if I misunderstood.
- Why?

1753
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,580
I'm a little pissed off.

1754
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,060
- I'm sorry if I misunderstood.
- Why did you touch his bang?

1755
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,350
- I'll apologize. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry if I misunderstood.

1756
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:49,350
- You wait.
- Okay.

1757
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,350
I'm sorry if I misunderstood.

1758
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,350
Did it go out?

1759
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,460
- It went out.
- It went out.

1760
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,770
Did it go out? They said yes.

1761
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,370
- This is driving me crazy.
- I should pass it to Ji Hyo.

1762
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:56,390
Hello.

1763
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,460
- Okay.
- Head the ball.

1764
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,460
- Nah.
- Nah.

1765
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,000
- Will you do it right away?
- Nah.

1766
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,040
That's it.

1767
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,060
- Hello.
- Hello.

1768
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,910
- Hello.
- So Min.

1769
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:06,980
- Did you see it?
- Nah.

1770
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,100
- Kick it over the net.
- Nah.

1771
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,480
- Hello.
- That's nice.

1772
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,750
(Woo Jae received the ball nicely.)

1773
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,020
- Go.
- I'll kick it.

1774
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,440
- Hello.
- That's right. Take it.

1775
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,790
- Nah.
- Nah.

1776
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,020
- I'll do it.
- Nah.

1777
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,060
- You do it.
- Nah.

1778
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,350
- Okay.
- Yes.

1779
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:20,460
(Jae Suk scored a point.)

1780
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,830
(Nah!)

1781
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:23,850
- What was that "nah?"
- Good job.

1782
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:25,750
- But...
- What was that "nah?"

1783
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,890
All right.

1784
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,790
He didn't follow the extra rule.
I'll give the other team a point.

1785
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,160
That's right.

1786
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,790
- Why? It's...
- You should say nah.

1787
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,440
- You should've said "nah."
- You should say "nah."

1788
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,940
But while I was doing the move...

1789
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,770
- It doesn't go like that.
- It's fine.

1790
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:40,270
Here I go.
So Min, get ready to take it.

1791
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:41,500
So Min, don't do it.

1792
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,210
- Hello.
- I'll take it.

1793
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:44,810
Nah.

1794
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,080
- That's right. Slow it down.
- Who will take it?

1795
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,080
Nah.

1796
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,520
- Just kick it over.
- Nah.

1797
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,390
Hello.

1798
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,020
Hello.

1799
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,060
Nah.

1800
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,560
- Nah. Oh, my.
- Nah.

1801
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,330
Nah.

1802
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,620
(He made a mistake again.)

1803
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,350
(Nah!)

1804
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,790
Oh, my goodness.

1805
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,690
- I'm sorry.
- Use your head.

1806
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:04,660
- Nah.
- Nah.

1807
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,960
Good job.

1808
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,060
- He didn't do it.
- Now...

1809
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,210
Jae Suk didn't follow the rule
again.

1810
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,370
- They get one more point.
- No.

1811
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,270
- Okay.
- Just kick it over.

1812
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,480
(Nah!)

1813
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,000
(Jae Suk is busy kicking the ball
over the net as he's nervous.)

1814
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,180
He didn't do it. Okay.

1815
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,480
- Hey, go back.
- Why didn't you do it?

1816
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,710
- Get out.
- Come in.

1817
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:18,750
- Haha.
- Come in.

1818
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,410
- He can't say it.
- I can't do it.

1819
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,790
- Say it properly.
- You should shout when you kick it.

1820
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:23,080
Let's make it clear one more time.

1821
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,750
This is how you should say it, guys.

1822
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:25,890
"Nah." Like this.

1823
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,160
Nah.

1824
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,790
- You should emphasize the end.
- This is driving me nuts.

1825
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:30,250
We'll change it too then.

1826
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,620
- You can change it.
- "Oh, my."

1827
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,930
Do this.

1828
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:36,060
(What's that?)

1829
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,060
Why would you change it?

1830
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,640
- No, Suk Jin. Make them do this.
- What?

1831
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,460
(Screaming)

1832
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,560
- Do this.
- That's easy.

1833
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,440
- Make it higher at the end.
- Make it higher.

1834
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,730
- For three seconds.
- That's hard.

1835
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,850
- It's not funny.
- How is it possible?

1836
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:50,940
It's so hard to judge
whether it's done properly or not.

1837
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,480
Then how about this?

1838
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,980
(Jajakjakjak, ahjajakjajak.)

1839
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:54,980
Like this. Jajakjakjak.

1840
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,540
(Jajakjakjak, ahjajakjajak.)

1841
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,790
- No.
- Ahjajakjajak.

1842
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,350
It can't be over 5 or 6 syllables.

1843
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:01,460
- That's good.
- It's hard.

1844
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,790
- That's good.
- Jajakjakjak, ahjajakjajak.

1845
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:05,330
- It's too long.
- It's too long.

1846
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:06,560
- Make it shorter.
- Just do "ahjajakjakjak."

1847
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,160
(Ahjajakjakjak.)

1848
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,560
- Yes. You can do that.
- Ahjajakjakjak.

1849
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,560
- Like this.
- Is it okay?

1850
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,730
Ahjajakjakjak.

1851
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:13,100
How about this?
"Jong Kook, you punk."

1852
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,540
(The sound Team Do Kwon should make)

1853
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,370
- That's...
- What?

1854
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,310
I'm just asking.

1855
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22,580
- I'm just asking.
- No matter how much...

1856
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,750
If it's not okay, forget it.

1857
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,870
- Of course, you can't do it.
- I'm sorry. We won't do it.

1858
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,350
- Okay. You shouldn't do it.
- Yes.

1859
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:28,980
What should we say then?

1860
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,810
- Screaming?
- Yes.

1861
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,160
Make it real high.

1862
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,980
Do you know the sound
water deers make?

1863
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,080
You should make it high.

1864
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,560
Like this?

1865
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,560
- Some people can't do it.
- They should do "ahjajakjakjak."

1866
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,330
- Ahjajakjakjak.
- Ahjajakjakjak.

1867
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,890
- Try it.
- Ahjajakjakjak.

1868
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,790
- You should scream like that.
- Ahjajakjakjak.

1869
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,460
- You should do it like this.
- Ahjajakjakjak.

1870
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,460
Like this.

1871
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,560
No.

1872
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,910
No. It's this.

1873
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,540
(Screaming)

1874
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,910
- Hey.
- Why are you doing this?

1875
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,440
- I'm sorry, but you should do it.
- Why are you doing this suddenly?

1876
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,020
We have just decided.

1877
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,810
- Do it.
- This is not right.

1878
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:01,850
- You should do it.
- Just pick one.

1879
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:04,480
- How can we do it?
- We can do it. In 1, 2.

1880
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,160
(The sound Team Do Kwon should make)

1881
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,730
You said
we should do "ahjajakjakjak."

1882
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:09,750
- Go.
- But...

1883
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,000
- Ahjajakjakjak.
- Ahjajakjakjak.

1884
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,160
Their voices will be gone.

1885
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,370
- You can't do your concert.
- Wait.

1886
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,330
So Min, Ji Hyo,
you can use your hands.

1887
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,100
- Okay.
- We can use our hands?

1888
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,640
- You must receive it.
- Okay.

1889
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,660
And you come here.

1890
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,460
- Ahjajakjakjak.
- Okay.

1891
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,940
Good.

1892
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,870
- Nice.
- Ahjajakjakjak.

1893
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,180
- Oh, my.
- Okay.

1894
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,370
- Don't try to...
- Ahjajakjakjak. Oh, my.

1895
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:30,370
(Little One's header mistake)

1896
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,270
- Don't try to do it by yourself.
- Okay.

1897
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,480
- Doing "ahjajakjakjak" is...
- I'll do it.

1898
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,390
- "Ahjajkjakjak" is too long.
- I'll do it.

1899
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,390
He said he would receive everything.

1900
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:39,390
- What should we do?
- Hey.

1901
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:41,560
It's 10 to 7.
They got 2 points left.

1902
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,930
- We should win now.
- Here I go.

1903
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,100
I won't go easy now.

1904
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,350
Here I go.

1905
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,560
- Ahjajakjakjak.
- There you go.

1906
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,560
- Nice.
- Let So Min do it.

1907
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,960
- Ahjajakjakjak.
- Yes.

1908
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,060
(A frog spike with her hand)

1909
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,870
It was nice, So Min.

1910
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,370
- Okay.
- Okay.

1911
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,270
- Oh, right. "Ahjajakjakjak."
- They earned a point,

1912
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,540
but So Min didn't say the chant.
We'll give both teams a point.

1913
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,910
- He said she hadn't done it.
- Okay. Right. She didn't do it.

1914
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,080
Ahjajakjakjak.

1915
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,940
- Focus.
- Ji Hyo didn't do it either.

1916
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,690
You didn't do it.

1917
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,410
- I didn't do it?
- You didn't.

1918
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,620
- She didn't have to do it.
- I didn't kick the ball.

1919
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,660
- You didn't kick the ball?
- I...

1920
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,160
- I didn't kick the ball.
- She didn't touch the ball.

1921
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,460
Why do you see hallucinations?

1922
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,790
I'm sorry,
but why are you not doing anything?

1923
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:22,270
- I'm doing it.
- You should do something.

1924
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:23,620
- Suk Jin, she needs a ball.
- The ball didn't come to me.

1925
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,830
- Then...
- I mean...

1926
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,330
Hey, you should follow the ball.

1927
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,770
She didn't even touch the ball.
Why would you say that?

1928
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:30,270
- I mean... Hey, you.
- She didn't have the ball.

1929
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:31,440
- "Hey, you?"
- Hey, you.

1930
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,480
- How dare you call me like that?
- Did you see hallucinations?

1931
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,850
Who are you?

1932
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:35,370
- We're on the same team.
- Are you her relative or something?

1933
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,370
- He's her boyfriend.
- What did you say?

1934
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:38,080
- He's her boyfriend.
- Her boyfriend?

1935
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,250
Let's do it.

1936
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,620
Don't forget.

1937
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,020
- Don't forget.
- Think...

1938
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,290
- that you lost your mind.
- You should increase the energy.

1939
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:45,020
Think that you lost your mind.

1940
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,190
- Just put it in your head.
- Okay.

1941
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,930
It should be this loud.

1942
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:52,430
- Mine.
- Ahjajakjakjak.

1943
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:54,100
- Okay.
- Come on.

1944
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,830
- It's 12.
- I'll do it.

1945
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:57,890
(Ahjajakjakjak.)

1946
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,690
(Oh, my gosh.)

1947
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,040
It's 12.

1948
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,540
- It's 12 points.
- Okay.

1949
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,770
They scored 12 points.

1950
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:06,770
- What's wrong with him today?
- What's wrong?

1951
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:07,850
Do we have a spy today?

1952
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:10,940
It's 12 to 8.

1953
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,710
Now, you should speak informally
to each other.

1954
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,310
- Speaking informally. It's nice.
- Speaking informally.

1955
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:16,210
Suk Jin. Listen up.

1956
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,690
- They told us to speak informally.
- Suk Jin.

1957
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:19,250
- Speak informally.
- It has started.

1958
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,460
Don't speak formally.

1959
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,460
- Of course.
- Drop the honorifics.

1960
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,250
- Don't speak formally.
- It's the worst for Suk Jin.

1961
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,620
- Don't speak formally.
- This is a disadvantage for me.

1962
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,690
- Listen up, Jong Kook.
- Yes. I got it.

59:59,769 --> 01:00:00,840
Do Kwon.

1963
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:28,960
- You should look at my side too.
- I contributed...

1964
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,520
about 70 percent to our scores.

1965
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,640
- Hey.
- Suk Jin.

1966
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,460
- Hey.
- He spoke formally.

1967
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,560
Deduct one point.

1968
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,100
- Yes.
- Come on.

1969
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,580
He spoke formally. Deduct one point.

1970
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:39,980
- Yes.
- Come on.

1971
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,640
You can't speak formally
at a moment like this.

1972
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,980
- Speak informally to them.
- You know it, right?

1973
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,870
- Don't do that, Suk Jin.
- Okay.

1974
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,140
Speak informally, okay?

1975
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,940
- Jong Kook, kick it over.
- All right.

1976
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,120
(Jong Kook, kick it over.)

1977
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:53,560
(Glaring)

1978
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,750
Why are you glaring at him?

1979
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:57,750
I mean he didn't have to say that.

1980
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:59,930
- Woo Jae.
- I should let you know.

1981
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:01,430
- Okay.
- Jong Kook, laugh it off.

1982
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,460
- Jong Kook, hurry up.
- Hurry up, Jong Kook.

1983
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,790
Hey, Lump.

1984
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,440
- Muscles, give us the ball quickly.
- I got it.

1985
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,060
- Okay. It's our turn, right?
- Muscles.

1986
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,560
- Yes, it's you.
- It's you, isn't it?

1987
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,810
- Hurry up and give it to me.
- It's your turn.

1988
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,830
Isn't it your turn?

1989
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,580
- It's you.
- It's me?

1990
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,100
- It's you.
- We lost a point.

1991
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,710
- No, they're right.
- It's because of the extra rule.

1992
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:18,540
- Does it not matter?
- You lost a point due to the rule.

1993
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,850
We just gave them one extra point.

1994
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,540
Why are you speaking formally to me?

1995
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,190
Then try deducting my score.

1996
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:25,160
(Shocked)

1997
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:27,350
Why are you speaking formally to me?

1998
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:29,690
(Then try deducting my score.)

1999
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,350
(Very childish response)

2000
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,060
- He's the scariest.
- He's...

2001
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,290
(The producer fears nothing
since he is quitting next week.)

2002
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,440
Thank you.

2003
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,290
- Thank you. Seriously.
- Hey.

2004
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:42,770
Give us a point
since you spoke formally.

2005
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,540
- It was so nice.
- Right?

2006
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,270
Give us a point.

2007
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,310
Okay, let's go. Get ready.

2008
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,540
- Throw it, you punk.
- All right.

2009
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,710
You punk.

2010
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:57,980
- He didn't make any sounds.
- What?

2011
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,020
That's not what we are doing.

2012
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,480
- That option is over.
- We are speaking casually now.

2013
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,980
- What's wrong with him?
- What are you doing?

2014
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:02,980
- Is that option over?
- He doesn't understand.

2015
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,230
- Isn't that what we are doing?
- Hey.

2016
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,730
- It's over.
- Is he a fool?

2017
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:07,890
- What's wrong with you?
- I am sorry.

2018
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:09,600
- I am sorry.
- Is he stupid?

2019
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,960
- I am sorry.
- Hey.

2020
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,140
- Hey.
- I am going to take a break.

2021
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,500
Didn't you call Jeju Island
a metropolis last week?

2022
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:15,330
- Didn't you do that?
- No!

2023
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,770
- Welcome to Jeju Island!
- Was that him?

2024
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,810
- Metropolis?
- He called it a metropolis.

2025
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:21,270
- He called it a metropolis.
- What's up with him?

2026
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,750
- I am going to take a break.
- Metropolis.

2027
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,520
- Suk Jin.
- He became a fool.

2028
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,980
- Suk Jin, give me the ball.
- Let's go.

2029
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,140
- Suk Jin, give me the ball.
- What?

2030
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,350
- Hey, Lump.
- Hurry up.

2031
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,460
Lump, why do you keep playing?

2032
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:33,410
- You can't even play soccer well.
- Give other people a chance.

2033
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,230
- What?
- You can't even play soccer well.

2034
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:37,120
- Why do you care if I serve?
- Hey.

2035
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,190
Stop being cocky.

2036
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,730
- Hey.
- Give other people a chance.

2037
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:41,500
Instead of this ball,
I will use your head.

2038
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,430
I will use your head.

2039
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,440
- Come here.
- Will you rip my head off?

2040
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:47,640
Why won't you guys help me?

2041
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,140
(Standing afar)

2042
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,310
Why won't you help me?

2043
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:51,680
Give me your head.

2044
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,500
- That's scary.
- Hurry up.

2045
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,310
- Do Kwon, you should go.
- Ha Lump.

2046
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:56,540
- Do Kwon.
- Ha Lump.

2047
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:59,540
- Do it right.
- I like that look in your eyes.

2048
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,810
Don't glare at me, you punk.

2049
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:04,290
You lost a sense of it.

2050
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,580
Here you go. It's yours.

2051
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,810
- Is it mine?
- Mine.

2052
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,020
Hurry up.

2053
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:09,620
- Hey, Suk Jin!
- I was behind you.

2054
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,230
(Suk Jin failed
to receive the ball.)

2055
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,730
- Suk Jin!
- I was behind you.

2056
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,060
- I was behind you.
- Suk Jin!

2057
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,370
It went out.

2058
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:16,730
- Give me the ball again.
- It went out.

2059
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:17,770
- Hey.
- It went out.

2060
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,100
Sit here.

2061
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,040
- Sit here.
- What are we going to do with him?

2062
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,100
Stay here.

2063
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,600
- What are we going to do with him?
- You should have moved.

2064
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,710
Stay here.

2065
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:26,940
Let's go, Suk Jin. Get ready.

2066
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,440
- Yi Kyung, we need to do this.
- We need to do this.

2067
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,850
Suk Jin, are you going
to stand there?

2068
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:31,910
- Okay.
- All right.

2069
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,640
Jong Kook, move up a little.

2070
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,790
- Okay.
- Is it me again?

2071
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,460
Is it me again?

2072
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,850
(Passing through)

2073
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:40,060
- Okay.
- Is it me again?

2074
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,330
(He received the ball
with the back of his neck.)

2075
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,850
(Suk Jin messes up
even when he is at a corner.)

2076
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:47,060
- Again.
- You are good.

2077
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:48,100
- Again.
- Do Kwon.

2078
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,000
- Guys.
- You are good.

2079
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,060
Let's go.

2080
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,500
- Are you going to play like that?
- I gave you the ball.

2081
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,560
- Are you going to play like that?
- What?

2082
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,710
- Hey.
- Are you going to play like that?

2083
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:56,100
- Listen.
- Are you going to play like that?

2084
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,680
- Hey. For goodness' sake.
- You can't win a single point.

2085
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,770
- Are you going to play like that?
- What's up with this toothpick?

2086
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:02,180
- Hey.
- Who are you?

2087
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,940
- Hey, who are you?
- What's wrong with you?

2088
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,980
They are about to jump me.

2089
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:09,850
What's up with that pose?
What are you going to do?

2090
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:11,750
- What are you doing?
- What are you going to do?

2091
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:13,350
- Just go.
- Suk Jin,

2092
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,520
- I will move to the back.
- Okay.

2093
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:16,890
- Receive it.
- He dodged.

2094
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,060
- That's good.
- Send it over the net, Suk Jin.

2095
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,190
- Okay. That's good.
- Kick.

2096
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,330
Move out of the way!

2097
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:23,430
Okay.

2098
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,230
Move out of the way!

2099
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:27,290
(He belatedly ran over to the net.)

2100
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,730
(Team So Min scored thanks
to Yong Gu's slapstick comedy.)

2101
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:30,410
- One at a time.
- What?

2102
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:31,710
- One at a time.
- Give us the ball.

2103
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,370
- Do you want the ball?
- Webfoot octopus, bring it here.

2104
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:35,040
- I will stay at the front.
- Flatfish, what did you say?

2105
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,680
Hey, webfoot octopus.
Hey, gamjatang.

2106
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:37,940
- Gamjatang?
- Hey, bag of bones.

2107
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:38,940
Hey, dried cabbage.

2108
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,580
- What are you doing?
- You little...

2109
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,810
Get lost, paramecium.

2110
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,460
- Hey.
- Paramecium.

2111
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,390
- Paramecium.
- Get lost, paramecium.

2112
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:49,230
- Get lost, paramecium.
- Mosquito larva.

2113
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:50,290
What are you doing?

2114
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:52,000
- Cocoon.
- Pouty Mouth, bring it here.

2115
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,120
Hey, what's the score?

2116
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:55,690
It's 19 to 15.

2117
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:57,370
We are four points apart.

2118
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,600
Let's win this set.

2119
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,230
- You are cool.
- Let's win this set.

2120
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:02,440
- Let's go.
- Wake up, Jong Kook.

2121
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,960
Let's win this set.

2122
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:06,980
All right.

2123
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,940
- Good.
- Let's win this set.

2124
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,410
- Let's win this set.
- Kick it.

2125
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:11,520
- Good job.
- Okay. Nice.

2126
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,910
- All right.
- Good job.

2127
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,520
- Kick it. Good job.
- Okay. Nice.

2128
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,390
- All right.
- Okay.

2129
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:19,620
(Jong Kook showed slapstick comedy.)

2130
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,620
Good.

2131
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,560
- He looked like a fool.
- Good.

2132
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,290
- It's okay, Jong Kook.
- All right.

2133
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,930
Muscular Pig looked like a fool.

2134
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,290
- Muscular Pig.
- This isn't hard.

2135
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:29,770
- Hey.
- This is good.

2136
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:31,040
Aren't you going to play?

2137
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,190
- Give us the ball.
- I am playing.

2138
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,790
- Aren't you going to play?
- I am playing.

2139
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,230
- That isn't the issue here.
- Give them the ball.

2140
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,980
- What are you doing?
- Give us the ball.

2141
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,410
You can do that later.

2142
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,910
- Hey, euglena.
- You can do that later.

2143
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:43,100
Hey, Do Kwon,
do you want to have a go at me?

2144
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,440
- Receive the ball.
- Here I go.

2145
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,180
- You are doing well.
- Baldy, here I go.

2146
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:48,540
- Come on.
- Are you ready?

2147
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,480
Good.

2148
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,520
There you go.

2149
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:55,230
- Okay.
- Throw it.

2150
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,750
There you go.

2151
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,000
- Okay.
- Throw it.

2152
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,430
- Nice catch.
- Throw it.

2153
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,160
- There you go.
- What was that?

2154
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:03,330
- That was just wrong.
- Nice catch.

2155
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:04,460
- That was just wrong.
- Seriously.

2156
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:06,560
- You can't grab the ball.
- That was just wrong.

2157
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,870
- You can't grab the ball.
- Nice catch.

2158
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:09,160
You caught the ball well, Miss.

2159
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,940
They are hopeless.

2160
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,500
Suk Jin said,
"You caught the ball well, Miss."

2161
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,210
- One point to the other team.
- Okay.

2162
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:16,940
- Hey.
- You spoke formally.

2163
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,180
- Really?
- Hold on.

2164
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,910
I didn't speak formally.
I was being sarcastic.

2165
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,710
- "You caught the ball well, Miss."
- "You caught the ball well, Miss."

2166
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:23,620
- Is that casual?
- It's formal.

2167
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:25,520
Is it formal?

2168
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,410
- He spoke formally.
- Let's go.

2169
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,890
- Let's go.
- Everyone is...

2170
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,060
- nice.
- Let's go.

2171
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:31,560
- Mine.
- Everyone is nice.

2172
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,120
It's because everyone is nice.

2173
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,270
- Like this?
- Se Chan.

2174
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:37,890
- There you go.
- Don't touch it.

2175
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,640
- All right.
- Why didn't you kick it?

2176
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,960
- For goodness' sake.
- You should have kicked it.

2177
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:42,460
You should have kicked it.

2178
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,730
I gave you the ball.

2179
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:45,080
Suk Jin should have received it.

2180
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,770
Bang!

2181
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,080
Good job.

2182
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,710
- Suk Jin.
- It's 23 to 21.

2183
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,680
- Two more points.
- Two more points.

2184
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,410
- It's our turn.
- Let's win two more points.

2185
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:55,250
- We can come from behind.
- Two points.

2186
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,890
- Let's win.
- We haven't turned the tables once.

2187
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,080
That startled me.

2188
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,080
- You got this.
- Okay.

2189
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,120
- Head it.
- Knees.

2190
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,190
- Jae Suk.
- All right.

2191
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:03,390
- Good.
- Okay.

2192
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,100
- All right.
- Do Kwon.

2193
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,390
- Don't forget to speak casually.
- Good job.

2194
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:08,730
- Good.
- All right.

2195
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:09,960
- Good.
- Yi Kyung.

2196
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:11,440
- Good.
- There you go.

2197
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,890
(It's an impressive rally.)

2198
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:14,060
- Here it comes.
- Go slow.

2199
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,710
- You are good.
- There you go.

2200
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,910
- You are good.
- There you go.

2201
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,440
- You are good.
- There you go.

2202
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,870
(He tried to receive the ball
with the top of his head.)

2203
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:25,640
Hey, Woo Jae is good at this.

2204
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:28,910
- Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae is good at this.

2205
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:31,250
- Who knew? Woo Jae.
- Woo Jae is good at this.

2206
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:32,980
You are good.

2207
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,750
- You are good.
- All right.

2208
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,230
Suk Jin.

2209
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:38,520
You are good.

2210
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,750
The rally was going well.

2211
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:42,370
Now, the score is 24 to 21.

2212
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:43,390
How are you so good at it?

2213
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,060
You have to maintain a smile
and continue speaking casually.

2214
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,600
(Maintain a smile
and continue speaking casually.)

2215
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,960
(Laughing)

2216
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,540
Smiling isn't hard.

2217
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,500
Members of our team
have smiley faces.

2218
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,370
- Continue speaking casually?
- Smile.

2219
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:59,140
- Smile and keep speaking causally.
- Smile.

2220
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:00,620
A blank face...

2221
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,750
- will cost you a point.
- Of course.

2222
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,520
- We can't get angry.
- Just smile...

2223
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,520
no matter which team scores.

2224
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,730
- Okay?
- You need to smile.

2225
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:09,730
- Hey.
- I am smiling.

2226
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,390
Smile even if you lose a point.

2227
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:13,520
- You need to smile.
- All right. Let's go.

2228
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,770
Let's go, guys.

2229
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:16,120
(They begin with a cheerful serve.)

2230
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,390
- Haha, receive it.
- Let's go.

2231
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:18,560
Good.

2232
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,230
- Come on.
- Yi Kyung.

2233
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:23,140
We are doing great.

2234
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,310
- Do Kwon.
- Smile.

2235
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:27,410
Do Kwon.

2236
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,750
- Hey.
- Out.

2237
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,140
Hey.

2238
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,250
Do Kwon.

2239
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:32,480
- Out.
- Out.

2240
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,310
- Out.
- Out.

2241
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,080
(He headed the ball
that was already out.)

2242
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,190
(Laughing)

2243
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:38,580
It was out.

2244
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:39,890
It was out.

2245
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,160
- It was out.
- I am sorry.

2246
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:43,320
Out.

2247
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:46,530
Do Kwon, you did so well.

2248
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:47,930
We don't need to be greedy.

2249
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:50,030
It was out.

2250
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:51,570
- Suk Jin.
- Why did you do that?

2251
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,160
- Why did you do that?
- You fool.

2252
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,960
- It was out.
- Why did you do that?

2253
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,400
- It was out.
- Really?

2254
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:00,700
- Suk Jin, it was out.
- Why did you do that?

2255
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,150
I got confused.

2256
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:05,180
- Suk Jin, I don't understand you.
- It's not like that.

2257
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,410
- It was out.
- I...

2258
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:09,650
- You are really bad at this.
- Why did you head it?

2259
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:11,490
- I had to think for a second.
- Really?

2260
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:12,650
Still,

2261
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:14,690
- it's nice that no one is angry.
- Suk Jin.

2262
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:17,560
Suk Jin, give us the ball.

2263
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,400
- We have to smile.
- Why did Suk Jin do that?

2264
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,200
- Give us the ball.
- It was unbelievable.

2265
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,990
- Let's smile.
- Here it comes. One, two, three.

2266
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:25,030
- Here it comes.
- Se Chan, smile.

2267
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:26,330
- Maintain a smile.
- Okay.

2268
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:27,530
What a beautiful smile.

2269
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:28,700
- So Min.
- He looks angry.

2270
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,900
- Okay. Good job.
- Good job.

2271
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,000
What a beautiful smile.

2272
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,870
- Good job.
- Good.

2273
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:33,980
- Go.
- Suk Jin.

2274
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,350
- Okay.
- It's okay.

2275
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,570
- It's okay.
- Big sister...

2276
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,020
could have received it
with her hands...

2277
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,110
Big sister could have received it
with her hands...

2278
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:46,780
Did you just say "Big sister?"

2279
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,250
- He said "Big sister."
- Big sister.

2280
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,360
One point to the other team.

2281
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,030
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2282
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:53,700
Woo Jae.

2283
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:55,770
There is no big sister.

2284
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,570
I think Woo Jae gave us ten points.

2285
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:58,900
- Let's speak less.
- Woo Jae.

2286
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,100
- You are cool.
- Woo Jae,

2287
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,000
- you are giving them many points.
- Let's speak less.

2288
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,660
- Speak casually.
- Let's go.

2289
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:04,940
- Okay.
- All right.

2290
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:06,400
- Hurry up.
- Here we go.

2291
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,000
- Let's win.
- Let's go.

2292
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:09,780
- Let's go.
- Let's win.

2293
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:12,110
- I think we can win.
- Good job.

2294
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:13,910
Good job.

2295
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,580
I can't believe he succeeded.

2296
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,390
- Okay.
- Send it over the net.

2297
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:18,950
- Okay.
- It didn't go over the net.

2298
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:20,150
- It didn't go over the net.
- Yes, it did.

2299
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,560
- Send it over the net.
- Okay.

2300
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:23,150
- It didn't go over the net.
- It didn't go over the net.

2301
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:24,320
Yes, it did.

2302
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,360
(Did it go over the net or not?)

2303
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,400
- His foot went over the net.
- His foot went over the net.

2304
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,660
- Sir, it went over the net.
- Is that a blank face?

2305
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,960
- It went over the net.
- Look.

2306
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,440
It went over the net.

2307
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:33,770
- No, it didn't.
- My foot stopped right here.

2308
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:34,960
It shouldn't have gone over the net.

2309
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:36,400
It didn't go over the net.

2310
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,330
Since Yi Kyung spoke formally,
the other team got two points.

2311
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:39,830
My goodness.

2312
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,180
(They got 2 points at once.)

2313
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,310
- Did you speak formally?
- To the producer...

2314
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:47,110
- To that punk producer...
- Don't speak to him formally.

2315
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,210
Seriously.

2316
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,080
We even speak casually
to the director.

2317
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,520
- He is younger than you.
- Since when were you so polite?

2318
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,560
But...

2319
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,750
Here comes a serve.

2320
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,360
All right.

2321
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:00,030
Se Chan's face is too blank,
so they will receive a point.

2322
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

2323
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,620
Se Chan's face is too blank,
so they will receive a point.

2324
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,290
- Okay.
- Okay.

2325
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,330
- Se Chan, you need to smile.
- I...

2326
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:09,460
- You need to smile.
- Here I go.

2327
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:10,940
- You need to smile.
- Would you give me the score?

2328
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,440
It's six to four.

2329
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,780
- Okay, we have a chance.
- Just now,

2330
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,900
- he spoke formally.
- Let's go.

2331
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,480
Since Jae Suk spoke formally,
they will receive a point.

2332
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:22,190
- A point.
- Why did you do that?

2333
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,690
- All right.
- Why did you do that?

2334
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:25,910
It's hard to win a point, Jae Suk.

2335
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,820
It's hard to win a point.

2336
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:30,030
- Seriously.
- Why did you do that?

2337
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,820
Why did you do that?

2338
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,060
- Jae Suk, thank you.
- It's hard to win a point.

2339
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,790
- Maintain a bright smile.
- Let's go.

2340
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:38,070
- Go ahead.
- Here we go.

2341
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,240
That was sharp.

2342
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:41,810
It's over. Out.

2343
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,570
- My goodness.
- Good job.

2344
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,940
Thank you, sir.

2345
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,870
You are a fool.

2346
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:49,980
Yi Kyung said, "Thank you, sir."
The other team gets a point.

2347
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,000
(Yi Kyung spoke formally.)

2348
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,180
It's okay.

2349
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,650
- It's okay.
- That's great.

2350
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:54,820
Hey, get out.

2351
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,020
- Get out.
- Get out.

2352
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,320
Get out.

2353
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,750
I spoke to the sky.

2354
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,610
- What should we do?
- Get out.

2355
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:01,750
What's the current score?

2356
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,080
It's 29 to 27.

2357
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:05,030
You are playing until 36.

2358
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,990
- What's the current score?
- It's 29 to 27.

2359
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,570
- Let's turn the tables.
- Okay.

2360
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:10,700
Let's go.

2361
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,770
- How many points do we have?
- You have 27 points.

2362
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:14,740
- We have a long way to go.
- I said it so many times.

2363
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:17,070
- You could tell me once more.
- Are your ears stuffed?

2364
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,810
- No.
- I said it so many times.

2365
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,040
Your pronunciation is lousy, okay?

2366
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,110
Let's go.

2367
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:25,350
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2368
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:27,740
- Let's turn the tables this time.
- Ji Hyo, you can use your hands.

2369
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,110
- Let's go.
- I can use my hands.

2370
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,820
- Let's go.
- Smile.

2371
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:33,060
- You need to smile.
- There you go. Good job, Woo Jae.

2372
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,990
- Okay. There you go.
- Can you get it over the net?

2373
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,390
- Okay.
- Mine.

2374
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,860
- Okay.
- Yes.

2375
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:45,290
(Paramecium made
a careless mistake.)

2376
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:46,400
(Forced happiness)

2377
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,000
Foot volleyball is so much fun.

2378
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,270
- You fool.
- Woo Jae, what was that?

2379
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:52,110
What was that?

2380
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:53,400
Look at Ji Hyo.

2381
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:56,110
Sir, Ji Hyo pulled his hair
with an angry look on her face.

2382
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:57,570
- I felt so loved.
- I did it with a smile.

2383
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:58,570
It wasn't like that.

2384
01:13:58,570 --> 01:13:59,570
You spoke formally.

2385
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:00,910
- They get a point.
- That's right.

2386
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,240
They get a point.

2387
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,850
Hey.

2388
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,910
- He fell for his own trick.
- Get lost if you want to be formal.

2389
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:07,950
- That's right.
- Maintain a smile.

2390
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:09,730
- Let's go.
- Why did you do that?

2391
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,430
- We can turn the tables.
- I did it with a smile.

2392
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:13,150
How about Ji Hyo?

2393
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,400
- I didn't see it.
- I did it with a smile.

2394
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,290
- You didn't see it?
- I did it with a smile.

2395
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:20,100
- Give me the ball.
- Let's go.

2396
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,640
- What will we do with Woo Jae?
- Let's smile. Here I go.

2397
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,360
- Let's go.
- Move out of the way.

2398
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:27,810
What are you doing?

2399
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:29,240
This is fun.

2400
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,740
- Out.
- Let's go.

2401
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,190
- Out.
- Let's go.

2402
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:36,950
(He slapped the ball angrily.)

2403
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:38,020
He expressed anger.

2404
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,490
He expressed anger.

2405
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,320
- He expressed anger.
- He expressed anger.

2406
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,560
(He acted out in anger.)

2407
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,530
- He expressed anger.
- Let it slide.

2408
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,960
Wouldn't you say
it was an expression of anger?

2409
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,430
Wouldn't you say that?

2410
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,530
All right. Se Chan spoke formally
and Suk Jin expressed anger,

2411
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:54,860
so both teams will gain a point.

2412
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,240
- What's wrong with you?
- Keep quiet.

2413
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,500
Calm down.

2414
01:14:58,780 --> 01:14:59,900
Speak less.

2415
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,570
Se Chan, keep quiet.

2416
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:02,950
I am sorry.

2417
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:04,310
- Speak less.
- Let's do this seriously.

2418
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:06,020
- Okay.
- It's okay.

2419
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,410
I am happy.

2420
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:08,990
- Why?
- I am so happy.

2421
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:11,210
- I am happy too.
- Stop speaking nonsense and begin.

2422
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,110
Stop being an eyesore
and send the ball over.

2423
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:14,820
- Here I go. Move out of the way.
- Okay.

2424
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,950
Focus.

2425
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,030
Smile.

2426
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:19,150
- It must be mine.
- What a beautiful serve.

2427
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:20,230
Good.

2428
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:21,570
- Good.
- There you go.

2429
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:22,860
Nice save.

2430
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:23,930
Good.

2431
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,070
- Good.
- There you go.

2432
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:27,400
(Jong Kook received the smash well.)

2433
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,530
- Good.
- That was cool.

2434
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:31,570
- Nice save.
- I got this.

2435
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,900
- I got this.
- You are doing well.

2436
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,280
- You are doing well.
- Kick it.

2437
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,950
- Mine.
- Send it over the net.

2438
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,040
Okay.

2439
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,320
(He smashes the ball
for the 2nd time.)

2440
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,740
- Okay.
- Okay.

2441
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:43,850
- Out.
- All right.

2442
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:44,860
(He failed to return the ball.)

2443
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:45,910
- Good.
- Okay.

2444
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:47,950
(They scored a point
after a nice rally.)

2445
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:50,190
- Good.
- It was great.

2446
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:52,060
- Good job.
- You did so well.

2447
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,230
You did so well.

2448
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,900
(Disappointed)

2449
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,770
It was an easy one.

2450
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,570
It was so close.

2451
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:03,160
- It was too deep.
- You did so well.

2452
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,000
- It's okay. It was a great rally.
- It was so nice.

2453
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,570
- All right.
- Smile.

2454
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:10,870
- Smile. A few people didn't smile.
- Of course.

2455
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,910
- We are happy.
- Let's make it a tie.

2456
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:14,570
Let's make it a tie. Let's go.

2457
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,190
- We are doing so well.
- Let's go.

2458
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:17,350
One more point.

2459
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,820
- One more point.
- Good job.

2460
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,780
- Don't be polite.
- Okay.

2461
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:21,820
Smile.

2462
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,490
(Team So Min serves
on the verge of a tie.)

2463
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:24,820
- Smile.
- Smile.

2464
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,490
- Don't give them a point.
- There you go.

2465
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:27,730
You are good, Woo Jae.

2466
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,600
- There you go.
- Mine.

2467
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,960
- Good.
- All right.

2468
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,770
- Jae Suk, send it over the net.
- Let's go.

2469
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:34,140
- Let's go.
- Move out of the way. Good.

2470
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,440
- All right.
- Go slow. Okay.

2471
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,110
- Mine.
- Move out of the way.

2472
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:39,030
- Okay. Good.
- Go slow.

2473
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:40,810
(Se Chan sends the ball
to a corner.)

2474
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:42,040
- Go slow.
- There you go.

2475
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,180
There you go.

2476
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:44,540
There you go.

2477
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:45,740
Suk Jin.

2478
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,350
- Go slow.
- Suk Jin.

2479
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,150
- Send it over the net.
- Send it over the net.

2480
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:50,650
Receive it.

2481
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:52,250
- Good job.
- Let's smile.

2482
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,190

- Smile.

2483
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:58,230
- We are happy.
- Send it over the net.

2484
01:16:58,230 --> 01:16:59,250
There you go.

2485
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,600
Come on. Go slow.

2486
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,960
- Yes. Move out of the way.
- Send it over the net.

2487
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:03,400
- Okay.
- Good.

2488
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,990
- Good.
- This is a nice rally.

2489
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:07,360
- Go slow.
- Jae Suk isn't smiling.

2490
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,640
- Smile.
- Jae Suk isn't smiling.

2491
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:13,940
- All right.
- Jae Suk isn't smiling.

2492
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,200
(Jae Suk's smash)

2493
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,900
- Smile.
- Jae Suk isn't smiling.

2494
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,900
(He received it.)

2495
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,040
- All right.
- The net.

2496
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,320
Go slow.

2497
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,740
- Suk Jin, go slow.
- Hey.

2498
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:22,820
Send it over the net.

2499
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:23,820
Good.

2500
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,860
(Gosh.)

2501
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,650
- It was close.
- Good job.

2502
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:30,750
Good job, Woo Jae.

2503
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,030
(Woo Jae ended the longest rally
in the history of the show.)

2504
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:34,750
(They succeeded to score after
a tight rally.)

2505
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,990
- Good.
- We got this.

2506
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:37,990
We can win.

2507
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:39,030
Good.

2508
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:40,770
- You guys are so cool.
- Suk Jin.

2509
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:41,960
- Suk Jin, smile.
- Smile.

2510
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,360
Suk Jin.

2511
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,610
- It's 34 to 34.
- It's 34 to 34. It's a tie.

2512
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:46,810
- Two points remain.
- It's a tie.

2513
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:48,850
- There won't be a deuce.
- Let's score two points.

2514
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:50,310
- Two points.
- Smile.

2515
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:51,980
- Two points.
- Okay.

2516
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:53,850
Let's go, Woo Jae.

2517
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:55,040
- Smile.
- Maintain a smile.

2518
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,250
- Smile. Don't be polite.
- Let's score two points.

2519
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,780
- Good.
- That was perfect.

2520
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:02,150
Good job.

2521
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:03,620
- All right.
- Woo Jae, go slow.

2522
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,230
- There you go.
- Use your hands.

2523
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:07,120
- There you go.
- Go slow.

2524
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,160
- What should I do?
- Send it over the net.

2525
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,160
- No way.
- Good job.

2526
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,640
- Good job, Suk Jin.
- Good.

2527
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:14,640
- There you go.
- Good.

2528
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:18,000
- There you go. Nice header.
- Use your hands.

2529
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,370
- All right. I will pass the ball.
- Suk Jin.

2530
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:23,980
All right. It's a bit difficult.

2531
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:25,320
- But you got it.
- Good.

2532
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:26,950
- It's a bit difficult.
- Go slow.

2533
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:28,110
- But you got it.
- Good.

2534
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,450
Nice. Send it over right away.

2535
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:32,910
- Nice.
- There you go. Good job.

2536
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:34,020
- Nice.
- Good.

2537
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,730
- Nice.
- There you go. Good job.

2538
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:37,360
(He cleverly tipped the ball
over the net.)

2539
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,360
There you go. Good job.

2540
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,360
- Nice.
- Good.

2541
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,490
- Nice.
- There you go. Good job.

2542
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,000
There you go. Good job.

2543
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:51,310
(My goodness.)

2544
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:54,500
- Nice.
- Good.

2545
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,370
(He fell down.)

2546
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:00,950
I am okay.

2547
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:03,390
- I am okay.
- Are you in pain?

2548
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,990
(They laugh more loudly.)

2549
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:08,110
Are you okay?

2550
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,230
(They come together
whenever Jong Kook makes a mistake.)

2551
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:10,320
Are you in pain?

2552
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,930
- It looks like you are hurt.
- I am okay.

2553
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:13,060
Are you okay?

2554
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,600
- Are you okay?
- I am okay.

2555
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,860
I am okay.

2556
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,600
- What was that?
- I am okay.

2557
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:21,200
- I am okay.
- I feel dizzy.

2558
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:23,700
I felt like I could save it.

2559
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,500
What was that?

2560
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:27,330
I fell to the floor.

2561
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:29,200
- My stomach hurts.
- I fell to the floor.

2562
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:31,450
I fell to the floor.

2563
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,780
- One more point.
- That was so funny.

2564
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,240
- One more point.
- One last point.

2565
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,020
- I felt like I could save it.
- All right.

2566
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:39,520
- Let's go.
- They will win...

2567
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,990
if they score
two consecutive points.

2568
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:43,530
- Okay. I could have saved it.
- Let's make it a tie.

2569
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:45,650
- One more point.
- Let's make it a tie.

2570
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:47,750
- Yi Kyung, one point.
- One point.

2571
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:50,200
- Smile.
- Speak casually.

2572
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,360
One point.

2573
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:52,940
- Smile.
- It was close.

2574
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:55,070
- Focus.
- Okay. I am okay.

2575
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,610
- One point.
- Speak casually.

2576
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,680
- Smile.
- Smile.

2577
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,940
- You did well.
- Good.

2578
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,310
- Smile.
- Smile.

2579
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,870
- Mine.
- Okay.

2580
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:04,310
- You did well.
- Go slow.

2581
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:05,710
- Smile.
- I could have saved it.

2582
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:07,020
- Good.
- Go slow.

2583
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,410
- You got this.
- Good.

2584
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,320
- It's over.
- Out.

2585
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,390
- Out.
- It's over.

2586
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:14,250
- Out.
- Out.

2587
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,560
(The ball went out.)

2588
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,890
- It went out.
- Out.

2589
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:18,080
Look at Suk Jin's face.

2590
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,250
- Why did you do that?
- Look at Suk Jin's face.

2591
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,600
It was close.

2592
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,930
- It was so close.
- All right.

2593
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,240
This point will decide the winner.

2594
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,530
We tried to be too serious.

2595
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,140
- This point will decide the winner.
- Let's go.

2596
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:29,310
Let's go.

2597
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,530
One point.

2598
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:32,480
- This is the last point.
- One point.

2599
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,500
One point.

2600
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:35,650
- This is fun.
- We can do it.

2601
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,650
- Seriously.
- This is a neck-and-neck match.

2602
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:40,070
- Smile.
- My cheekbones hurt.

2603
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:41,710
- Be careful.
- This has never happened before.

2604
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:43,190
- I am so happy.
- Be careful.

2605
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,490
This is nerve-racking.

2606
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:46,560
- Just don't speak.
- Right.

2607
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:49,750
- Mine.
- Will you receive it?

2608
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:52,750
- Mine.
- Will you receive it?

2609
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:56,700
- Go slow.
- Send it over the net.

2610
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,070
(My goodness!)

2611
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:07,180
(The whistle marks
the end of the game.)

2612
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:09,000
- Yes!
- We won!

2613
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,280
Let's turn.

2614
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:12,520
We won!

2615
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,320
(Team Do Kwon won.)

2616
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,820
- Let's turn.
- We won.

2617
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:17,950
We won.

2618
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:25,120
I mean...

2619
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:28,250
You were doing so well.
What was that?

2620
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,320
Are you kidding me?

2621
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:31,790
- You were doing so well.
- Seriously.

2622
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:33,400
Why did you mess up
at a crucial time?

2623
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,270
- I was under so much pressure.
- We haven't won once.

2624
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:37,810
- Jae Suk.
- We need to win once.

2625
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,400
- Jae Suk, what was that?
- We were so close.

2626
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,480
- We need to win once.
- We can't let it slide like this.

2627
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,370
- Why did you do that?
- Isn't the game over?

2628
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:47,180
- What? We lost because of you.
- I am so angry.

2629
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,520
- Why did you do that?
- We played so diligently.

2630
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,710
Our effort went to waste
because of you.

2631
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:53,780
Why didn't you focus?

2632
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:54,780
What did you say?

2633
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:56,230
- We were so close to winning.
- I don't know.

2634
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:59,400
While you drink water,
we will distribute the prize money.

2635
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,400
We were so close.

2636
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,860
- We were so close.
- Woo Jae received the ball...

2637
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,600
even when it was a difficult shot.

2638
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,030
I see that I am good with balls.

2639
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:08,810
- I want to play another game.
- Right? It was fun.

2640
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:09,960
- It was fun.
- All right.

2641
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:13,870
For the winning team,
the maximum amount is 70 dollars.

2642
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:16,180
For the losing team,
the maximum amount is 40 dollars.

2643
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:18,870
- We didn't win once.
- Not once.

2644
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:21,650
- Suk Jin, Yi Kyung, and I...
- We didn't win once.

2645
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:22,850
- Seriously.
- We didn't win once.

2646
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,710
Can you tell me how much money
the first place has?

2647
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:29,080
The first place has a lot of money.
As for the rest, it's similar.

2648
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,250
- Really?
- Yes.

2649
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:31,650
I shouldn't be greedy.

2650
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:33,700
I am a candidate for the penalty.

2651
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:36,320
- It's about the three.
- I have to win the prize.

2652
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,460
- Jae Suk is...
- I can't be sure yet.

2653
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:39,990
The difference isn't so big.

2654
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:42,500
- Let's just say it openly.
- One, two,

2655
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,610
three. Open.

2656
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:46,000
- It's 32 dollars.
- My gosh.

2657
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,610
(32 dollars, 51 dollars, 51 dollars,
69 dollars, 20 dollars)

2658
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:51,650
The 3 members with 51 dollars
and 69 dollars are out.

2659
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:53,680
You get 32 dollars and 20 dollars.

2660
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:54,910
What happened to you?

2661
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:56,210
Hey, how could you...

2662
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,650
- You're a pushover.
- You got it.

2663
01:22:57,650 --> 01:22:59,210
- We have the same amount.
- This is...

2664
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,990
All right. You're up next.

2665
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:02,490
- Okay.
- One.

2666
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:03,730
(How much did they write
within 40 dollars?)

2667
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:06,360
- Two. Three.
- Open.

2668
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:08,360
(20 dollars, 40 dollars)

2669
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,100
I got it.

2670
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:11,570
- This is so tight.
- All right.

2671
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,100
The members with 40 dollars
and 24 dollars are out.

2672
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,200
- My gosh.
- You get 22 dollars.

2673
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,960
- I wrote 20 dollars.
- You did well.

2674
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,070
- It's not bad.
- Well done.

2675
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:21,110
- We never know how it will end.
- Right.

2676
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:22,610
We don't know it yet.

2677
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:25,320
Count your money now.

2678
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,520
Hang on. How much do I have?

2679
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,520
Now you can't exchange money.

2680
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,350
I have only 29 dollars.

2681
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,020
That's a lot.

2682
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:33,210
- It's not much.
- Do you have 29 dollars?

2683
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:34,250
I should've won at least one.

2684
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,890
I have 33.6 dollars.

2685
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,780
- I have 49 dollars.
- You have 39 dollars?

2686
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:39,600
No, it's 49 dollars. Yes.

2687
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:42,200
Hey, there's not much
of a difference.

2688
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,900
I wish I made more money
at the last moment.

2689
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:46,740
All right. The results are in.

2690
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,810
This is bad. It must be
either you or me.

2691
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:52,480
All right. We will show you
the prize for the winners first.

2692
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,700
- What's that? My gosh.
- My gosh.

2693
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,280
- What's that?
- That's amazing.

2694
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,280
I want it.

2695
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,980
- Seriously?
- The first place prize is...

2696
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:01,450
something useful in summer.

2697
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,580
It's an electric fan of D company
and a watermelon.

2698
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,210
- My gosh.
- It's good for a family with kids.

2699
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:09,390
The second place gets beef,
and the third place gets pork.

2700
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:10,690
(Beef for the 2nd place,
pork for the 3rd place)

2701
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,450
- Who is the winner?
- All right.

2702
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:14,700
I'll announce first place.

2703
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:17,600
(Who is the winner
of the Race of Groups?)

2704
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:19,900
It's Jeon So Min with 64 dollars.

2705
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:20,900
(1st place: Jeon So Min
with 64 dollars)

2706
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,270
She's our team.

2707
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:24,000
(1st place: Jeon So Min
with 64 dollars)

2708
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,280
(So Min is the sole winner.)

2709
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,500
- You did it.
- It's her first time winning.

2710
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:29,810
- No, it's her second time.
- It's been a long time.

2711
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:31,450
- That was Jeon So Bal.
- I see.

2712
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:33,020
This is my first time.

2713
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:34,540
- Is she the winner?
- Thank you.

2714
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:35,650
You're so lucky, So Min.

2715
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,280
- This is great.
- My gosh.

2716
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:39,750
Well done.

2717
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,750
- Good.
- Congratulations.

2718
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,450
- She takes it right away.
- Today...

2719
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:44,530
- That looks great.
- I'll announce the second place.

2720
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:47,530
It's Lee Yi Kyung with 49.1 dollars.

2721
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:48,820
- I can't believe this.
- Is he second place?

2722
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,990
(2nd place: Lee Yi Kyung
with 49.1 dollars)

2723
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,700
(Me?)

2724
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,160
I turned the game around!

2725
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:55,830
- It's unbelievable.
- Hey.

2726
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:57,270
You won second place with ten cents.

2727
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:58,460
- Really?
- Is that true?

2728
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,440
The ten cents. It's from you.

2729
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,640
Third place is Kim Jong Kook
with 49 dollars.

2730
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,610
- I told you before.
- My goodness.

2731
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:05,980
I said you could win
with the ten cents.

2732
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:08,070
Se Chan threw away the ten cents.

2733
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,190
- I...
- Really?

2734
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:11,710
The money you gave him earlier?

2735
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:17,890
(Se Chan gave Suk Jin
ten cents for a taxi earlier.)

2736
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:19,990
Why? It's still money.

2737
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,700
(The ten cents was
dumped on the floor.)

2738
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:26,460
(And Yi Kyung took it
with gratitude.)

2739
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:29,200
(He won 2nd place
with the ten cents.)

2740
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:30,330
- I...
- Really?

2741
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:31,330
The money you gave him earlier?

2742
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:33,740
I begged for money.

2743
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:35,480
And I collected money
I found on the floor.

2744
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:37,350
You get beef.

2745
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:38,350
- Take this.
- It's all thanks to you.

2746
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:40,910
- Congratulations.
- Kim Jong Kook gets pork.

2747
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:42,780
- Thank you.
- Pork belly.

2748
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,410
Now I will announce
the members who get the penalty.

2749
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:47,250
This is driving me crazy.

2750
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:48,250
- Here.
- We started with no money.

2751
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,060
It was neck and neck.

2752
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,740
First, the member
with the least money.

2753
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,000
(The last is announced first.)

2754
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,740
It's Ji Suk Jin with 27 dollars.

2755
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,020
It's settled then. It must be me.

2756
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:05,710
(It's settled then. It must be me.)

2757
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:06,820
- And Ha Do Kwon.
- What?

2758
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:08,020
(Ha Do Kwon with 27.1 dollars)

2759
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:09,190
- Isn't it me?
- Why?

2760
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,650
(Ha Do Kwon with 27.1 dollars)

2761
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:12,120
(Ha Do Kwon?)

2762
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,620
- He fooled us.
- Why?

2763
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,530
(Did Jae Suk survive?)

2764
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:17,860
- It's not me.
- You survived. What happened?

2765
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:20,240
- How much do you have?
- I'm not right for Running Man.

2766
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,640
- How much is the difference?
- I have 27.1 dollars.

2767
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:22,990
- I have 29 dollars.
- It's about 1 dollar.

2768
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:24,140
It's two dollars.

2769
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:25,440
- That's a lot.
- At the last moment,

2770
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,940
Ms. So Min gave us a dollar each.

2771
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,980
Ms. So Min gave me a dollar.

2772
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,110
I thought I was rich.

2773
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:33,910
That's funny.

2774
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:35,520
Let's start the penalty then.

2775
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:37,110
- Do Kwon.
- This is the worst.

2776
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:38,320
Today, Do Kwon is...

2777
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,890
(Today's penalty:
Human Webfoot Octopus)

2778
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:41,320
Do Kwon, are you ready?

2779
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,490
- Yes, I'm ready.
- All right.

2780
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:44,250
- Do Kwon will go first.
- Okay.

2781
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:46,250
One, two...

2782
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,120
Two...

2783
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:54,770
(Swelling up)

2784
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,240
- My gosh.
- That went well.

2785
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,500
That was fun, Do Kwon.

2786
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,700
Next up is Seok Sam.

2787
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,110
Can you do this, Yi Kyung?

2788
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:04,110
- Of course.
- Throw it hard like this.

2789
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:06,240
- Can you do this with a smile?
- Sure.

2790
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,820
I will do it as you sing.

2791
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:12,850
- That sounds good.
- I’m looking and looking at you

2792
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:14,610
- My goodness.
- What was that?

2793
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:17,190
- Hey.
- Gosh.

2794
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,990
Hey, come on.

2795
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:21,930
(His aim is off.)

2796
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:24,030
- It's not fun.
- Yi Kyung...

2797
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:25,030
Yi Kyung doesn't know how to do it.

2798
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:26,030
I'll do it.

2799
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:27,900
- Why did you let him do it?
- He wanted to try.

2800
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:31,140
- Let me try it again.
- I'll do it. My goodness.

2801
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:32,940
- Do it again.
- He doesn't know how to do it.

2802
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,810
Why are you doing it again?

2803
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:37,040
- Did you get my consent?
- No.

2804
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:38,980
Do it again.

2805
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:41,740
- This is...
- We didn't see anything.

2806
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:44,320
- I should throw it hard.
- Okay.

2807
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:48,520
- As if it rains.
- I'm looking and looking at you

2808
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:52,930
(That was neat.)

2809
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:55,530
He's a pro.

2810
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:57,120
That was perfect.

2811
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,990
- He's professional.
- Thank you for today.

2812
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:00,570
This is what you should do.

2813
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:01,940
Good work today.

2818

I don't like this one.

2819
