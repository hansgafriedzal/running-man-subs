from Running Real Estate.)

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,980
(Welcome to Running World.)

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,220
- Oh, my.
- Why?

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,550
- What's going on?
- What's this?

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,830
(They're surprised
by the grand studio.)

17
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,260
- What is it?
- It's Busan.

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,920
Is it Busan-themed today?

19
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,120
- No, there's Seoul too.
- Busan?

20
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,770
There's no Jeju Metropolis?

21
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,470
- Busan.
- There's Jeju Metropolis too.

22
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,090
- Haha.
- Ulsan.

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
- What's with today's setting?
- Suk Jin will like this.

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Haha.

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,410
- What's this?
- Haha.

26
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,730
- Real estate.
- You need to find Jeju Metropolis.

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,980
Hurry and find it.

28
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,650
Find Jeju Metropolitan City.

29
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,340
- Hurry and find it.
- As soon as I entered...

30
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,150
- Try finding it.
- There are many cities.

31
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,240
- Suk Jin.
- What's going on today?

32
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,350
I'm not sure what it is,
but it looks exciting.

33
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,240
- It's what you like. Real estate.
- Why?

34
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,290
For me...

35
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,210
- Oh!
- Is it a competition?

36
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,430
This is my life.

37
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,790
I've never succeeded in it though.

38
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,490
- This theme today...
- You know, right?

39
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,820
Se Chan, Jong Kook, and I did
a similar show.

40
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,820
Right.

41
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,070
- We know this. But...
- Real estate?

42
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,760
- Whenever we get the information...
- Oh, gosh.

43
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,760
- Right.
- Woljeong-ri in Jeju Island?

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,540
If you invested,
how would it turn out?

45
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,800
- At Jeju Island?
- Yes.

46
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,480
- I won't be here.
- Seriously?

47
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,570
- I won't be here.
- If you invested?

48
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,410
- It's now over thousands of times.
- Isn't it like twentyfold?

49
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,620
- That doesn't make sense.
- Jong Kook.

50
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,770
It's now 86 times higher.

51
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,880
- That's right.
- Was it 86 times?

52
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,350
- Woljeong-ri rose 86 times higher.
- Eighty-six times.

53
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,450
(Anyway, they're here as a result
of not buying property back then.)

54
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,820
- Woljeong-ri?
- It's only cash for me.

55
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,820
Cash.

56
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,380
- He makes me frustrated.
- Only cash for me.

57
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,290
- He never invests.
- Yes.

58
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,760
I don't know about these.

59
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,370
Near Jong Kook's apartment,

60
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,020
there's a rumor that
a jangdokdae is buried underground.

61
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,960
- There's cash in it.
- A bunch of cash is in it.

62
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,200
- Yes.
- Under the floor.

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
He goes there every month...

64
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
- It's your mission.
- and digs up.

65
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,180
Try digging.

66
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,100
So I'm carefully
looking around that area.

67
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,150
- Yes.
- He's so sure of keeping cash.

68
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,910
I have no assets.

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,690
If Suk Jin listened to me,

70
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,950
- He won't be here?
- You wouldn't have seen me.

71
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,220
He would have enjoyed his life.

72
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,350
I'm a proactive investor type.

73
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,560
Such wealth can lead to
loss of health.

74
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,920
- But Suk Jin...
- There's no mercy.

75
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,500
- But you know that about him...
- You're right.

76
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,890
- Be positive.
- I agree.

77
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,130
- For Suk Jin, he...
- What?

78
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,200
never listens to people...

79
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,230
who stayed with him for a long time.

80
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,940
- But by chance,
- Random person.

81
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,260
if he meets a man at the airport...

82
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,810
- An old gentleman.
- A new person.

83
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,600
the conversation he heard
while the elevator door closed.

84
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,220
- An old gentleman.
- He listens well to these people.

85
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,480
(It activates Seok Sam's
gullible tendency.)

86
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,980
I lost so much after listening to
the president of Korean Association.

87
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,720
That happens.

88
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,190
- It's weird. It happens to me too.
- Why are we like that?

89
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,410
- I experienced it too.
- We can't help it.

90
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,450
I don't know why.

91
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,630
- I've never invested.
- Yes.

92
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,630
But I listened to one person's
advice and invested.

93
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,970
- But I got doomed.
- Right?

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
Seriously. That happens.

95
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,890
- Jong Kook's style is...
- I blew up so much money.

96
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,290
- mostly not listening to others.
- For real.

97
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,600
But he loses everything
through his close friend.

98
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,570
- In one go.
- In one go.

99
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,600
Mine was huge.

100
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,200
Honestly, people like Ji Hyo...

101
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,380
is great to be cheated on.

102
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,750
No, you're the best.

103
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,850
(No, you're the best.)

104
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,980
You little...

105
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,480
- He really hit him.
- I didn't think he would.

106
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,610
- He really hit him.
- Ji Hyo...

107
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,010
For today...

108
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,060
Some might have done this before.

109
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,260
- Yes.
- It's an upgraded hopscotch.

110
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,420
I wanted to do this.

111
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,470
- The immersion is no joke.
- We've done it a long time ago.

112
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,000
I think I've done this before.

113
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,160
- You tried when you were a guest.
- Yes, as a guest.

114
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,730
(The first hopscotch special
on episode 281)

115
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,200
(The first hopscotch was
full of slapsticks.)

116
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,010
(Se Chan was a guest for the second
hopscotch special on episode 321.)

117
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,850
- Yes, you were a guest.
- I was...

118
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,260
- a team with you.
- You were...

119
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,320
in a team with me.

120
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,820
You could be a member
because I took care of you.

121
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,950
- Because you did well that day.
- Suk Jin...

122
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,000
- Don't say that.
- You didn't matter.

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,390
- That's how you succeeded.
- No way.

124
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,230
- I did nothing.
- I'll tell you the facts.

125
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,470
You never made anyone succeed...

126
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,360
and no one succeeded because of you.

127
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,700
- You and I think differently.
- You...

128
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,940
are the only one
who was raised by us.

129
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,540
- Only you.
- You only raised Hyun Woo.

130
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,540
His wife raised Hyun Woo
all by herself.

131
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,680
He raised no one.

132
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,510
- Do you know about my family?
- Of course.

133
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,770
You always went to a cyber cafe.

134
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,620
That's a long time ago.

135
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,970
- It's an old story.
- I...

136
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,990
So I was worried and I asked,

137
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,490
"Don't you need to
take care of Hyun Woo?"

138
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,710
- He said, "He will..."
- He'll grow on his own.

139
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,990
- "grow on his own."
- Grow himself.

140
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,080
- Of course.
- Right. They grow by themselves.

141
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
Currently, at the back,

142
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,800
there are provinces
of metropolitan cities.

143
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
They are metropolitan cities
of Running Man.

144
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,960
- Jeju Island is there too.
- Jeju Metropolitan City.

145
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,070
Jeju Metropolis is there.

146
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,830
- So there are a total of 70 lands.
- Oh, my.

147
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,030
- Yes.
- That's a lot.

148
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,900
One mat is equivalent to one land.

149
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,640
You'll be able to purchase land
within your budget.

150
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,070
There are good and
bad factors in the land.

151
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,250
- Oh, in the land.
- But these are...

152
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,340
not real and all randomly chosen.

153
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,580
- Is it random?
- Yes.

154
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,820
It's just imaginary.

155
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,190
- It's imaginary.
- That's better.

156
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,380
That makes it fair.

157
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,020
Land prices rise and fall depending
on the good and bad factors.

158
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,430
Every hour from 12 p.m. until the end,

159
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,460
we'll give you the profits.

160
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,030
Some lands will have good factors...

161
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,330
so they'll make you
profit every hour.

162
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,400
But some will have bad factors
and take your money instead.

163
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,970
- We can't know in advance.
- But Gangnam is a must.

164
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,050
There are more lands
with good factors.

165
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,110
- Yes.
- Okay.

166
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,950
After you earn your money
through a mission,

167
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,710
you'll buy lands.

168
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,450
Then you'll only be able to live
within your lands.

169
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,780
- It's small. The land is small.
- Right.

170
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,060
After that,
we'll calculate your profits.

171
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,020
- I see.
- If you earn 30, we'll give you 30.

172
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,070
Each empty land is 100 dollars.

173
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,130
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

174
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,010
If you're taking away from others,
it'll be 150 dollars.

175
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,200
- A hundred and fifty dollars.
- Yes.

176
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,070
If you pay ten dollars,
you can see the land information.

177
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,310
(When the land is purchased
through an intermediary office)

178
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,470
But you can have a deal
amongst yourselves.

179
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,120
You can negotiate
to purchase the land for 50 dollars.

180
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,820
If you step on others' lands,

181
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,450
you need to pay
ten dollars as a toll.

182
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,880
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

183
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,490
Today's penalty and prize
work like this.

184
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,860
Excluding the richest two,

185
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,760
we'll choose randomly
among the five members.

186
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,130
- Oh, seriously.
- Among five of us?

187
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,590
We're going to cash out...

188
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,760
the land you have at the end
of the day for the rankings.

189
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,200
So it's important for you
to have many good lands.

190
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,380
Okay.

191
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,950
- Only the first and second matter.
- No use from the third.

192
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,070
I need to be the first
or the second.

193
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,880
We should see these carefully.

194
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,280
One has a chair.

195
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,490
- One has food.
- I want the land with food.

196
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,780
I should buy accordingly.

197
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,190
I have to be at Incheon Seo-gu...

198
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,520
- to eat.
- Yes.

199
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,700
We need both Incheon Seo-gu
and Gwangju Nam-gu to eat.

200
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,700
- You want to sleep?
- Then Busan area isn't good.

201
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,870
It's a path to the bathroom.

202
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,590
- I need to rest.
- Jong Kook.

203
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,590
Even the bathroom?

204
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,940
We need to buy Busan
to go to the bathroom.

205
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,460
- We need to pay to go?
- Seriously?

206
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,070
We can't exempt you from it.

207
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,630
- To go, you need to step on it.
- Seriously?

208
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,200
If you step on others' land,
you have to pay ten dollars for toll.

209
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,340
- Ten dollars?
- Please give me a chamber pot.

210
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,840
I'll just secrete in the water.

211
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,920
If you want to change your clothes
if they get wet,

212
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,380
- Do we need to buy?
- we prepared them.

213
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,450
- Is it prepared?
- Oh, there's a place to change.

214
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,080
- You can see it on your right.
- For real?

215
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,690
You can only change to those.

216
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,320
Or you can decide not to change.

217
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,360
- First, I need to eat.
- This land can earn the most money.

218
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,800
- Incheon and Gwangju.
- I want that.

219
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,170
It's not bad to receive tolls
for the bathroom.

220
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,960
I think that land will bring
the most profit.

221
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,740
- Right. The most profitable land.
- But how many times...

222
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,670
- will we visit the bathroom?
- Right?

223
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,010
We'll go only once.

224
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,010
- Shall I make them eat first?
- If I can't, I'll just...

225
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,400
excuse myself.

226
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,380
- At where?
- Behind the plants.

227
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,380
- I don't know.
- Urinating on the street.

228
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,990
- It's okay.
- I don't know.

229
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,080
In the pot...

230
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,580
- Inside the fitting room.
- Inside there...

231
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,580
I'll just excuse myself.

232
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,360
- We prepared a pool just in case.
- What?

233
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,780
- You can use the pool too.
- Right.

234
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,220
Yes, we can use the pool.

235
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,950
We'll start the mission
for you to earn...

236
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,520
- the first investing money.
- Yes.

237
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,630
- We need to earn money.
- The first earning is vital.

238
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,530
What is it? There's another game?

239
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,130
We'll start the mission for you
to earn the investing money.

240
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,770
- We can buy land with this.
- This mission is...

241
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,950
beneficial for real estate investors
who know well about geography.

242
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,950
Geography?

243
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,550
The mission is called
Going to Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, and Busan.

244
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,820
- What?
- Okay.

245
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,320
The seven cards in front
are written...

246
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
- with starting points in Korea.
- Starting points.

247
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,560
Choose one card
and from your starting point,

248
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,590
search your destination.

249
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,700
According to the taxi fares,
we'll pay you from highest to lowest.

250
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,090
- That's nice.
- Oh, gosh.

251
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,040
- This is...
- I should know the geography.

252
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,940
- Is this random?
- Yes.

253
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,500
- The starting points are different.
- It's random.

254
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,910
- So it's random.
- Yes.

255
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,370
- We should know the geography.
- Shall we go one by one?

256
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,180
- Who will start first?
- Haha can start first.

257
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,420
- Shall I go first?
- Yes.

258
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,480
- I know geography well.
- You know a lot.

259
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
- I know the roads.
- He drives a lot.

260
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,890
- Because I...
- You know about the whole nation?

261
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,950
- Of course.
- Yes?

262
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,450
I know most places.

263
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,560
(Thinking hard)

264
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,030
- Do I just take it? I pick it?
- I know most places.

265
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,070
(Which starting point
did Haha choose?)

266
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,170
- The starting point.
- Let's see.

267
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,700
Mount Mudeung at Gwangju.

268
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
- It's far.
- I don't know where that is.

269
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,470
- They have delicious meat.
- It's far.

270
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,200
You need to choose a destination
with the highest taxi fare.

271
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,340
- Okay.
- I see.

272
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,420
(Next is Jong Kook's
starting point.)

273
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,420
- It's here.
- That's so good.

274
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,580
You hit the jackpot.

275
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,350
Daejeon Expo.

276
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,610
(Daejeon Expo Park)

277
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,610
The middle area is bad.

278
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,620
- Are you Daejeon?
- Where did you pick?

279
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,620
- Daejeon Expo.
- You're done.

280
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Then you're...

281
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,300
Just choose Seoul
as your destination.

282
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,560
- Choose Seoul.
- It's difficult.

283
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,360
- Sokcho.
- You may choose your destination.

284
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,460
Yours is fine.

285
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,800
- Is it?
- It's nice.

286
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,300
- Busan Haeundae Beach.
- It's good.

287
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,730
- It's good.
- This is good.

288
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,070
Mine is South Chungcheong Province,
Kkotji Beach at Anmyeon.

289
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,470
You can go there by taxi.

290
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,970
Because at Gyeonggi...

291
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,150
- By taxi.
- Okay!

292
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,570
I got Dongducheon City Hall.

293
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,740
- Dongducheon.
- It's my neighborhood!

294
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,420
Why does that matter?
You need to write the destination.

295
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,080
- What?
- Jong Kook and I got the worst.

296
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,320
You need to write the destination.

297
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,750
I can go to Busan or Jeolla Province
since they're far.

298
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,480
- Then I need to go like this.
- Go like this.

299
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,530
Write your own destinations.

300
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,220
Daejeon is about here.

301
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,070
- It's the furthest like this.
- By taxi?

302
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,670
- I can write wherever I want?
- Yes.

303
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,040
Like this.

304
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,000
Anywhere, right?

305
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,830
- What is in this area?
- Write the exact location.

306
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,940
What places are there in this area?

307
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,370
It's best if you write Yangyang.

308
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,550
- What are you talking about?
- Yangyang.

309
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,280
I know that it's close by.

310
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,690
- You know that?
- Yangyang is right here.

311
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,790
- This is very far.
- Show me.

312
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,790
From Dongducheon...
I shouldn't let you know.

313
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,980
(The kid from Dongducheon already
wrote his destination.)

314
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,480
The area
where Ttangkkeut Village is located.

315
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,450
- What was the name? Hahoe?
- You can choose any place.

316
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,620
- It's Hanam.
- No, that's not it. Ha...

317
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
- Hadong.
- It doesn't matter.

318
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,770
(Is Ttangkkeut Village located in
South Gyeongsang Province, Hadong?)

319
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,090
I'm sorry about the noise.

320
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,640
(She's bad at
the geography of Korea.)

321
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,460
To be honest,
those who picked Busan...

322
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,180
or Dongducheon got so lucky.

323
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,000
- Why? Are you belittling the areas?
- South Chungcheong Province is...

324
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,470
I'm not belittling the areas.
You know exactly where it is.

325
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,110
- "Are you belittling the areas?"
- And they're in the northern part.

326
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,950
Why would you belittle the areas?
Dongducheon is a nice place.

327
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,390
- We always...
- I'm saying it's a good thing.

328
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,110
- attack one another like this.
- Exactly.

329
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,320
You know that, right?
I must say, we always...

330
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
We always attack one another
like this.

331
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,290
- I'm saying you're at an advantage.
- "Are you belittling the area?"

332
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,390
(The Running Man style of dissing)

333
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,490
- I'm dumbfounded.
- "Are you looking down on me?"

334
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,990
Please tell us your destinations.
Haha, where is your destination?

335
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,490
- Okay.
- Hwacheon-gun Office.

336
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Next.

337
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,270
I picked Haenam-gun Office.

338
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,810
- Haenam-gun Office? Okay.
- Yes.

339
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,470
- That's far, indeed.
- Oh, my.

340
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,730
- He picked Haenam-gun Office.
- Next.

341
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,000
- Seok Sam.
- Me? I picked Homigot in Pohang.

342
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,180
(Departure point: Daejeon Expo Park,
Destination: Homigot in Pohang)

343
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,570
- Pohang is far from there.
- Indeed.

344
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,280
- Next.
- Hadong...

345
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,480
A parking lot
in Ttangkkeut Village in Hadong.

346
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,740
She wrote the wrong name.

347
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,190
A parking lot in Ttangkkeut Village
in Hadong?

348
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,450
- It's in Haenam, not in Hadong.
- It's not in Hadong.

349
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,560
- It's in Haenam.
- Isn't it in Hadong?

350
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,490
- Look. Hadong is...
- Isn't it in Hadong?

351
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,030
Hadong is
in South Gyeongsang Province.

352
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,560
- This is why...
- I get it. This is why...

353
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,460
- you told me not to tell her.
- That's right.

354
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,090
You didn't tell me intentionally,
right?

355
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,990
Ttangkkeut Village is located in
Haenam.

356
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,270
- Next.
- I picked Eurwangni Beach.

357
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,360
- From Haeundae Beach.
- You picked a perfect place.

358
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,940
- To Eurwangni Beach.
- That's very far.

359
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,330
- Yes, indeed.
- Next up is Ji Hyo.

360
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,740
I'm going to a night sea cart bar
in Yeosu.

361
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,920
- What?
- Isn't that the name of a bar?

362
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,210
- Pardon me?
- I think...

363
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,710
- You can go with it.
- that Ji Hyo...

364
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,950
- It must be close by.
- She just wanted to go there.

365
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,110
From Kkotji Beach on Anmyeon Island
in South Chungcheong Province...

366
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,980
- to a cart bar in Yeosu.
- She just wanted to go there.

367
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,290
- I picked...
- From South Chungcheong Province...

368
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,250
Sagewood Country Club
in Gyeongdo, Yeosu.

369
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,220
- It's located in Gyeongdo, Yeosu.
- Is it a country club?

370
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,860
It's located
on the edge of the island.

371
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,960
- On the edge of the island.
- Really?

372
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,070
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go!

373
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,170
- It'll be Jae Suk or Se Chan.
- Let's go!

374
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,570
Haha, please show your board
to the camera.

375
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,680
(From Mount Mudeung in Gwangju
to Hwacheon-gun Office)

376
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,350
It's actually Hwacheon-gun Office.

377
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,890
- Oh, my. It's coming up.
- My gosh.

378
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,800
- How much would it cost?
- I don't know the name of the area.

379
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,230
- I can't see it.
- Which area is there?

380
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,860
- It's 436.01 dollars.
- How much?

381
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,730
- How much?
- It's 436.01 dollars.

382
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,910
- How many kilometers?
- It's over 430 dollars?

383
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,340
- It's really far.
- Oh, my.

384
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,970
It wasn't a bad choice, right?
Look. It goes all the way south.

385
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,450
- Oh, that's where I should go.
- Right?

386
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,450
Next. Jong Kook, please show us.

387
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,770
I picked Haenam-gun Office.

388
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,720
(From SBS Prism Tower
to Haenam-gun Office)

389
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,740
- That's far.
- It's on the edge.

390
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,060
- It's on the edge.
- He picked the farthest place.

391
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,120
- It's 356.91 dollars.
- Haha wins.

392
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,160
I got a higher number.

393
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
(Jong Kook's taxi fare:
356.91 dollars)

394
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,720
- I got a higher number.
- Why is that?

395
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,360
- The road conditions must be good.
- Yes, exactly.

396
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,120
Oh, the road conditions are better
on his route.

397
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,800
- There's the Seohaean Expressway.
- That's right.

398
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,730
That's the place I wanted to go to.

399
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,440
- Isn't it near the place?
- This is awesome.

400
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,670
The road conditions can... I see.

401
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,730
Next.

402
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,230
- Homigot in Pohang.
- It's near Busan.

403
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,870
Haha moved diagonally,
and Jong Kook moved straight.

404
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,550
- Pohang is that way. Yes.
- He picked a good place.

405
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,610
- It's far.
- It's far.

406
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,180
- It's not so far.
- It takes three hours.

407
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,550
It's 262.94 dollars.

408
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,950
- It's not so far.
- I'm relieved.

409
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,960
- It's not so far.
- It's close to his starting point.

410
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,320
Could I get no results?

411
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,880
Next, So Min's destination is...

412
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,850
There may be no results
for Ttangkkeut Village, Hadong.

413
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,560
- You should type "Hadong."
- It's not very far.

414
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,360
- I'll type "Hadong."
- Okay.

415
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,170
You should type something like
"Hadong-gun Office."

416
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,700
My old nickname was Hadong.

417
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,970
Hadong. That's right.

418
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,360
(The taxi fare: 803.09 dollars)

419
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,130
It's 803.09 dollars.

420
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,630
- I'm surprised.
- It's over 800 dollars?

421
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,810
(It's 803.09 dollars!)

422
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,720
- It's over 800 dollars?
- It's 803.09 dollars.

423
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,840
- What? Are you sure?
- Really?

424
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,340
Hang on. You wrote
"Ttangkkeut Village," right?

425
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,510
And "Hadong."

426
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,350
- But she wrote the wrong name.
- Try Ttangkkeut Village.

427
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,960
- Ttangkkeut Village.
- That shouldn't be accepted.

428
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,120
- But you all accepted it.
- Hadong is at the southern end too.

429
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,890
- She's out.
- What are you talking about?

430
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,960
- This is unacceptable.
- My gosh.

431
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,070
Guys, let me off, please.

432
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,590
Then how about we give her
half of it to be fair?

433
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,670
- Okay.
- I'll take half of it.

434
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,730
- That sounds fair.
- Her fare is 400 dollars.

435
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,340
You picked the right place.
Hadong is very far.

436
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,000
- Indeed. It's over 800 dollars.
- Right.

437
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,540
- It's on the edge.
- If it was Ttangkkeut Village...

438
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,640
(From Haeundae Beach
to Eurwangni Beach)

439
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,740
Eurwangni Beach.

440
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,610
My, I see
the road conditions have improved.

441
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,510
- Exactly.
- Any place from Seoul...

442
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,340
It's 573.47 dollars.

443
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,980
- How much?
- It's over 570 dollars.

444
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,060
(It's 573.47 dollars!)

445
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,060
- It's over 570 dollars?
- You did well.

446
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,690
- It's far.
- The road conditions must be good.

447
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,700
You're currently in the first place.

448
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,250
It's over 570 dollars. Nice.

449
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,860
- A cart bar in Yeosu.
- It doesn't look too far...

450
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,170
- from Ji Hyo's starting point.
- It's really far.

451
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
I guess the distance isn't all
when it comes to taxi fares.

452
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,230
- You're right.
- The distance is quite long.

453
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,580
- It's 588.27 dollars.
- What?

454
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,470
- My gosh. What?
- It's five hundred...

455
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,000
(It's 588.27 dollars!)

456
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,550
Now, Ji Hyo won
by a difference of 15 dollars.

457
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,870
- Oh, my.
- But how come it costs more...

458
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,740
- for a shorter distance?
- Because of the road conditions.

459
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,880
Because the road conditions are
better on my route.

460
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,140
Did she take a deluxe taxi?

461
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,750
- It costs too much.
- Ji Hyo, you did a great job.

462
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,750
Let's move on to the last member.

463
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,350
Let's go to Sagewood Country Club
in Gyeongdo, Yeosu.

464
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,350
I think
it's far from his starting point.

465
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,520
It's 512.35 dollars.

466
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,970
- It's not that much.
- It's a lot.

467
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,170
- The road conditions must be good.
- Right. That must be the reason.

468
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,130
- It makes a big difference.
- As a result,

469
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,000
Ji Hyo placed first.

470
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,670
- She did an amazing job.
- No way.

471
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,540
- She didn't know where it was.
- Ji Hyo is really incredible.

472
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,230
- She didn't even know that.
- That's true.

473
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,540
She's so smart.

474
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,080
- Jae Suk placed second.
- My goodness.

475
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,180
- Se Chan placed third.
- All right.

476
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,950
- Haha placed fourth.
- Oh, my.

477
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,340
So Min placed fifth.

478
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,550
Jong Kook placed 6th,
and Suk Jin placed 7th.

479
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,660
I thought that Jong Kook would be...

480
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,350
- Hang on a second.
- Didn't we all laugh at them?

481
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,330
Her taxi fare was reduced by half.

482
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,800
- Yes, her fare is 400 dollars.
- That's why it's 400 dollars.

483
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,330
- It was over 800 dollars.
- It's because...

484
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,860
- It's because...
- My destination is...

485
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,170
- in the middle.
- there isn't a direct route...

486
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,520
- to So Min's destination.
- That's right.

487
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,440
- This is fun.
- It's over.

488
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,710
As a result of the game,
the winner gets 790 dollars.

489
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,600
And... You can come and receive it.

490
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,180
- I bet she'll buy a lot.
- She'll buy a lot of properties.

491
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,080
- Oh, boy. I think...
- We still have a chance to win.

492
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,710
Right. We have a chance to win.
How much do I get?

493
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,720
- Do I get 590 dollars?
- I get 690 dollars?

494
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,240
Now, you'll purchase...

495
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,590
- your first property.
- Yes.

496
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,060
The winner gets to
make a purchase first.

497
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,980
As you must know,
you can't purchase...

498
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,250
any of the properties she bought
in this round.

499
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,700
Let's move to the other set
and begin.

500
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,720
I'm really bad at investing.

501
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,220
(The members will officially begin
investing.)

502
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,230
(Current time: 11 a.m.,
Everything about this game is fictitious.)

503
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,810
Which area should I buy?

504
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,080
We should get the food first.

505
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,540
- Absolutely.
- Yes, we should get the food first.

506
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,100
But Ji Hyo will buy those areas.

507
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,050
Which area should we buy, Ji Hyo?

508
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,770
I have so little money.

509
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,740
I should buy this area to ally with
Ji Hyo and to get food.

510
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,880
(The profitable property that draws
the investors' attention is...)

511
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,050
Then I should buy the fridge
in the middle.

512
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,610
Right, you should.

513
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,330
Oh, my goodness.

514
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,980
- Oh, my.
- It's nice.

515
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,700
- I see chicken breast too.
- There's a lot of food in here.

516
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,220
- I'll have ice cream.
- I just need to have one meal.

517
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,970
Hey, there's frozen food too.

518
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,970
- Look at the crunchy fried chicken.
- Oh, my.

519
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,870
- This is it.
- Exactly.

520
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,700
- It must be more profitable.
- Ji Hyo will buy them all.

521
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,470
- How much is Seo-gu, Gwangju?
- It's 100 dollars.

522
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,760
- It's 100 dollars.
- I see.

523
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,300
I can use the toilet now, right?

524
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,470
- No.
- No, you can't.

525
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,500
(- I can use the toilet now, right?
- No!)

526
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,210
- I knew it.
- Oh, gosh.

527
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,970
I wish I could go to the restroom
before we begin the game.

528
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,780
Now, please make your purchase
starting with Ji Hyo.

529
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,510
I have a question.

530
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,750
Can another member buy the land
that I've purchased?

531
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,580
In the next round.

532
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,360
They can't do that in this round.

533
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,870
I see. Then I'd like to...

534
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,870
(Ji Hyo gets to choose the land
to purchase as the winner.)

535
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,370
My, look at the chicken breast.

536
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,440
There are chicken breast
and everything.

537
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,610
- But Ji Hyo will buy these areas.
- How much is Nam-gu?

538
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,070
Ji Hyo can't buy any more than...

539
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,450
(Ji Hyo is thinking hard.)

540
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,710
(Seo-gu, Incheon!)

541
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,240
Seo-gu, Incheon.
I'd like to purchase that area.

542
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,680
(She chose Seo-gu, Incheon, that's
in front of the snack table.)

543
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,580
We'll give you the land certificate.

544
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,720
(Land Certificate, Seo-gu, Incheon)

545
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,810
What?

546
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,120
(The value increases
as a dragon appears in the area.)

547
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,430
(The information on the certificate:
1. The cause of value changes)

548
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,460
(2. The profit from value changes
at hours)

549
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,870
(This property makes 200 dollars
every hour.)

550
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,730
And Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul.

551
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,470
Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul.

552
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,000
Dong-gu, Nam-gu,

553
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,330
and Suyeong-gu, Busan.

554
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,770
Hey, Jae Suk.

555
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,070
- She didn't buy it.
- This is...

556
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,570
- What?
- She bought those areas.

557
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,480
Why did she buy those areas?

558
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,240
I think it's because of the toilet.

559
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,050
Jae Suk, I think it's best
to buy the area in the middle.

560
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,160
- We should buy Buk-gu, Gwangju.
- Absolutely.

561
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,860
I'll buy these six areas.

562
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,860
(Jae Suk, who placed 2nd
with 690 dollars, is up.)

563
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,960
- This is the total amount.
- Okay.

564
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,130
(He bought all the areas around
the snack table and the fridge.)

565
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,720
(He checks the land certificates
as well.)

566
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,760
(Gwangsan-gu, Gwangju,
The value increases every hour.)

567
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
(Nam-gu, Gwangju,
The value increases every hour.)

568
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,230
Great. It's nice.

569
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,610
- Did you make your purchase?
- My, these properties...

570
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,640
- They're tasty, right?
- They're tasty.

571
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,270
(Yangcheon-gu, Seoul,
The value increases every hour.)

572
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,350
This is great. I struck gold.

573
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,920
(Seo-gu, Gwangju,
The value decreases every hour.)

574
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,150
Darn.

575
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,350
(The value of Seo-gu, Gwangju,
drops sharply.)

576
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,860
Gosh, seriously.

577
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,310
Darn it. This is not good.

578
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,430
Did you buy all of them, Jae Suk?

579
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,220
- Yes, I did.
- That's cool.

580
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,050
- Who's next?
- I didn't know it'd be like this.

581
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,550
- I'm next.
- I didn't go to the restroom.

582
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,900
You need to go to the restroom now?

583
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Why now?

584
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,290
Had you told me about the rules...

585
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,940
- You can buy Seo-gu, Busan.
- Pardon?

586
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,710
- What did you say?
- You can buy the area at the end.

587
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,870
(Seo-gu, Busan, is the toll gate
to the restroom.)

588
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,330
- Jae Suk, is this your land?
- Yes.

589
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,880
(Meanwhile,
Jae Suk New Town is being built.)

590
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,210
- I can't even go near it.
- He practically owns the fridge.

591
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,010
- I'm in trouble.
- I'll be hungry all day long.

592
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,740
He's like the owner of a snack bar.

593
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,980
I'm worried. What do I do?

594
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,120
- We can't go there.
- The only thing...

595
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,890
that Ji Hyo doesn't have is
access to the toilet.

596
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,160
- Jae Suk, you bought a lot.
- Of course. I bought six areas.

597
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,860
You can say
that you can't come near the fridge.

598
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,720
- Why did you buy only these areas?
- Also,

599
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,230
- I can move around the grass field.
- Yes.

600
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,490
- I can move this far. Sorry?
- Is it a common area?

601
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,370
- Oh, it's a common area.
- Yes. So I bought all these areas.

602
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,000
- Good for you.
- Right?

603
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,880
I can use this bed too.

604
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,300
I have food to eat
and a place to sleep.

605
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,010
I can go for a walk too.

606
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,810
- You can't use the toilet.
- What?

607
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,040
I can take care of that
behind the fridge.

608
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,750
I'll do it behind the fridge
like this.

609
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,750
(He'll actively use the blind spot.)

610
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,190
- Is it possible?
- Of course, it is.

611
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,130
- I can't see you.
- Right?

612
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,020
- And I have this.
- He says he can do that.

613
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,290
He says it's possible.

614
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,460
- It's so funny that he says so.
- We need it to cook.

615
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,670
- I might have to use it.
- We'll need that pot.

616
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,170
- That's nonsense.
- What?

617
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,940
Now, shall I eat some food?
Let me see.

618
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,030
I want to eat ramyeon, Ji Hyo.

619
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,300
Shall I give you ramyeon?

620
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,950
I'd like to purchase
Gangdong-gu, Seoul,

621
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,850
Jungnang-gu, Seoul, Jeju Island,
Seo-gu, Daegu,

622
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,270
- and Namdong-gu, Incheon.
- Seo-gu, Daegu?

623
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,620
- Yes.
- It's 580 dollars.

624
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,620
(He focuses on Jae Suk New Town
and the hydropower resources.)

625
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,720
If you give me
the land certificates...

626
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,580
(He receives the land certificates
of the areas he purchased.)

627
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,820
(Jungnang-gu, Seoul,
The value increases every hour.)

628
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,930
This is nice.

629
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,520
(Seo-gu, Daegu,
The value increases every hour.)

630
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,970
Good. I bought good land.

631
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,030
Shall I heat up some dumplings?

632
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,380
Shall I heat up some dumplings
using this microwave oven?

633
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,540
- Ramyeon goes well with dumplings.
- Right.

634
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,110
- What goes well with dumplings?
- Ramyeon.

635
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,810
Or for now

636
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,690
I'll have a cup of iced Americano
with ice cubes

637
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,280
I'm not jealous. You'll need to
use the toilet if you drink it.

638
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,510
Please leave my property

639
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,780
I can come to the common area
as well.

640
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,400
- That's right.
- How do you...

641
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,290
- Oh, my. You bought these areas.
- I can order some food here.

642
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,490
- Yes, that's right.
- You can go from here...

643
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,870
- and jump to this area.
- Yes.

644
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,030
- But you can't reach the fridge.
- No, he can't.

645
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,730
- I can take food out of it.
- How?

646
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,070
I'll show you later.

647
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,030
- Will you do it like this?
- Enjoy watching it.

648
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,570
(The fridge expressway will be open
later on.)

649
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,650
Okay. It's done.

650
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,920
Has it begun?

651
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,420
- Those who bought land have.
- The property owners have.

652
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,480
- Is that right?
- Yes.

653
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,780
Wait. First...

654
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,780
I'll bring some food.

655
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,220
(Se Chan is getting ready to move.)

656
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,200
What are you doing?

657
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,600
Good. It's so cool.

658
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,020
My, it's good.

659
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,330
- This is my land.
- He's upset.

660
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,490
- It's so nice.
- Don't put your feet in there.

661
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,500
I was going to drink the water
when I got thirsty.

662
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,530
(The water source is contaminated by
the thoughtless citizen.)

663
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,940
Why would you put your feet
in there?

664
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,210
It's so nice.

665
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,880
I've made my decision.

666
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,010
Give me a second.
Here's 400 dollars.

667
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,240
Thank you.

668
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,540
(He receives the land certificates.)

669
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,240
All right.

670
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,460
(Haha goes to an area
near Jae Suk New Town.)

671
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,750
Hello, sir.

672
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,750
- Hello.
- I've moved next door to you.

673
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,930
(The little neighbor came for food.)

674
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,660
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too. I hope we get along well.

675
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,630
- Oh, you're drinking something.
- Yes.

676
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,870
Jae Suk, can I get one too?

677
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,260
- What?
- Give me one of that, please.

678
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,990
- Salad.
- Hey.

679
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,410
- Please.
- What...

680
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,830
That was so smooth.

681
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,140
(Pumping)

682
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,210
Hey.

683
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,910
(Attacking with a water gun)

684
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,150
Give me a portion of salad now.

685
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,570
My gosh. I'm speechless.

686
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,620
(Here I come!)

687
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,240
Will you give me a salad or not?

688
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,690
You might get soaked
from head to toe.

689
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,580
- Hey, are you...
- Or you can enjoy the water park.

690
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,390
- Are you serious?
- Come on.

691
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,930
- Will you keep going on like this?
- Don't come near me.

692
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,660
- This has a long range.
- I'll never give you any food...

693
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,400
- if you keep acting like this.
- You'll never give me any food?

694
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,990
- No way.
- "No way?"

695
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,490
"No way?"

696
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,700
- It's fun to watch.
- Hey...

697
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,830
I'll never give you any food.
I'd rather get soaked.

698
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,940
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Yes. I don't mind.

699
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,230
- I'd rather get soaked.
- It's not too late. Say, "Stop."

700
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,770
- Say, "Stop."
- I'd rather get soaked.

701
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,040
- I'll never give you any food.
- Give me just one.

702
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,070
- No way.
- "No way?"

703
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,880
- "No way?"
- No way.

704
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,510
Then I won't let you eat either.

705
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,980
Drink some water instead.

706
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,810
- Didn't you put your feet in it?
- Yes, I did.

707
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,720
Yes, I put my feet in it.

708
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,690
I chose the right areas.

709
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,080
Gosh, those punks.

710
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,400
I checked out the properties
before I came here.

711
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,970
I'd like to purchase
these three areas.

712
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,140
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yongsan-gu, Seoul...

713
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,790
- These three areas?
- Yes.

714
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,210
I think that the value of Yongsan-gu
will increase.

715
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,560
Here's your land certificate.

716
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,230
It will increase by 300 dollars.

717
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,230
Oh, it has the information I need.

718
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,680
(Yongsan-gu, Seoul,
The value increases every hour.)

719
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,770
Thank you.

720
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,300
I have water.

721
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,470
- Water?
- Are the white areas yours?

722
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,620
Yes, I'm wearing a white shirt.

723
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,890
- I think I chose the wrong area.
- Oh, it matches the color.

724
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,620
I won't be seen.

725
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,360
So Min, did you make a purchase?

726
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,580
(The chair blocks her.)

727
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,750
- I made a mistake. I'm invisible.
- Did you make a purchase?

728
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,900
- Jong Kook, I bought Yongsan-gu.
- Yes.

729
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,990
The chair you're sitting on
blocks me.

730
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,940
- Jong Kook, you're up.
- Is it my turn?

731
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,290
All right.

732
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,670
Since I don't have much money...

733
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,180
Wait.

734
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,180
I have to give up on
either food or toilet.

735
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,300
(Food versus toilet)

736
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,880
I'll give up on food.

737
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,780
I'd like to purchase
Yeongdo-gu, Busan.

738
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,050
I think I'll have to stay here
if I buy Yeongdo-gu, Busan.

739
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,690
- He bought the toilet pass.
- I'll have to stay here.

740
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,930
My gosh.

741
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,290
(He starts living in one spot,
Yeongdo-gu, Busan.)

742
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,160
- I picked the wrong areas.
- The last member, please come.

743
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,870
- Sorry, but I'll use the toilet.
- Okay.

744
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,320
- Can you go to the toilet?
- Yes.

745
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,290
- Of course, I can.
- I guess you can jump.

746
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,410
- Of course, I can do it.
- Wait.

747
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,440
- Between the two options,
- Oh, gosh.

748
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,680
I chose the toilet
and gave up on the food.

749
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,210
That's my land.

750
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,450
Jong Kook, pay me ten dollars.

751
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,070
- Jong Kook.
- Can't I step on here either?

752
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,980
- No, you can't.
- I see. Okay.

753
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,280
- Hey, just give me ten dollars...
- Okay.

754
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,460
- Hey, just give me ten dollars...
- Okay.

755
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,660
(He jumped.)

756
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,990
Did he pull it off?

757
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,130
No one else but Jong Kook can
jump that far.

758
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,400
Dong-gu, Ulsan.

759
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,790
- Ulsan?
- Yes.

760
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,670
Is there anything I should know
about Dong-gu, Ulsan?

761
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,140
- Here's the land certificate.
- Okay.

762
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,000
Is there anything special
about the area?

763
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,300
(The value increases at noon
and decreases after that.)

764
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,850
(I picked a good one.)

765
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,450
At noon... Wait.
It goes down after that.

766
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,450
After I get 200 dollars at noon?

767
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,690
Can't I move to another area?

768
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,780
- You should sell it to someone.
- I should sell it.

769
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,620
Try to make the area
look profitable.

770
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,630
Really? How should I do that?

771
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,750
Try your best to make them believe
it's a profitable property.

772
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,360
Right. To sell the property?

773
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,630
- Can I sell it?
- Make them want to buy it.

774
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,290
(He begins playing the game
with an awkward exclamation.)

775
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,370
It's nice.

776
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,610
Hey, at least I picked a good area.

777
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,730
I can move to the common area.

778
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,740
I can jump over there as well.

779
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,570
I can move to the common area.

780
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,540
I can jump over there as well.

781
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,420
- And here...
- You just stepped on Buk-gu, Ulsan.

782
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
You have to pay ten dollars.

783
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,860
- What?
- You stepped on the area.

784
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,050
Gosh. Buk-gu, Ulsan...

785
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,460
(He's been fined ten dollars.)

786
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,720
What's wrong with Suk Jin?

787
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,660
I didn't step on it.

788
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,960
(He failed to promote his property
and ended up spending money.)

789
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,990
- Gosh. You're too strict.
- It's delicious.

790
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,100
- I'm back!
- Oh, gosh.

791
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,200
(I'm back!)

792
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,940
- I'm back!
- Oh, gosh.

793
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,170
(The gym lover in Busan goes
in and out of the toilet loudly.)

794
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,500
My gosh. Why would he... Okay.

795
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,070
Fine. Keep it strict.

796
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,070
- Suk Jin, do you have only 1 area?
- Yes, I have 1 area.

797
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,950
- I skipped breakfast this morning.
- I had breakfast.

798
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,480
From here...

799
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,390
But you see...

800
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,050
Suk Jin, you bought a good area.

801
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,520
(He stole Jae Suk's coffee
successfully.)

802
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,720
What is he doing?

803
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,130
It has the water
that I put my feet in.

804
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,250
You're lying.

805
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,970
(His next target is the fridge.)

806
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,730
Suk Jin, you can't do that.

807
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,560
- Hey, you can't do that.
- Move.

808
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,730
Why?

809
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,440
- You can't do that.
- Why can't I?

810
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,640
- Of course, you can't do that.
- Let's help each other out.

811
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,300
- You have to pay ten dollars.
- I see.

812
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,180
That's too much.

813
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,470
I'll give you anything you want
if you give me ten dollars.

814
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,280
(At that moment, Se Chan shoots
his water gun at something.)

815
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,860
(Suk Jin's land)

816
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,430
Don't you think
that he's acting like a thug?

817
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,790
- Gosh, Hey.
- You can't sit on it now.

818
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,050
- Stay standing all day long.
- That's not the problem.

819
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,970
- It's slippery.
- Right. Okay.

820
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,220
- Suk Jin.
- He can't go back to his land.

821
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,870
- You'd better stay there.
- Where?

822
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,400
- On the grass field.
- No.

823
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,180
We can't steal one another's
land certificate, right?

824
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,410
- That's not allowed.
- Okay.

825
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,610
(Seok Sam's goal is
to move to Incheon...)

826
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,610
(where he can get resources easily.)

827
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,720
Wait. It's time.

828
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,510
Jung-gu, Seoul.

829
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,120
(Suk Jin fell.)

830
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,580
- Jung-gu, Seoul.
- What did he do?

831
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,890
- What's his problem?
- Suk Jin, pay ten dollars.

832
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,020
Hey!

833
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,430
Darn it!

834
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,370
Why are you trying to lie down
during a shoot?

835
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,700
Oh, that's what he wanted?

836
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,000
(Biting)

837
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,300
Who wants to drink water?

838
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,830
(A cookie made him happy.)

839
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,180
You have to pay ten dollars.

840
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,310
(He's trying to get more food
with his arm shaking.)

841
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,480
- He's so cute.
- Indeed.

842
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,460
Then... Since we have
made a reservation...

843
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,920
- But I don't have any eggs.
- Water is ours, Haha.

844
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,480
Haha, take this water gun.
We should stop him.

845
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,490
- How can you steal my coffee too?
- Stop stealing food.

846
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,400
- Why would you steal my coffee...
- What's wrong with you?

847
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,820
(He shoots to help Ji Hyo.)

848
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,670
- Wait. Don't move.
- Why would you steal my coffee?

849
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,760
(Laughing)

850
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,300
- No.
- What's wrong with you?

851
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,470
- No.
- You're unbelievable.

852
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,610
- Stop it.
- Suk Jin, give Ji Hyo ten dollars.

853
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,470
- No.
- He didn't pay me either.

854
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,850
- You stepped on my land.
- No, I didn't step on it.

855
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,480
I feel like
I'm watching the show at home.

856
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,390
- What did you say?
- That's funny.

857
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,620
- I feel like...
- What did you say?

858
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,480
- I feel like I'm watching TV.
- What are you doing there?

859
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,720
Why are you slacking off?

860
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,190
There's nothing I can do.

861
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,660
The only thing he can do is
use the toilet.

862
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,870
- I can only jump to the toilet.
- How will you cook it?

863
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,990
Well...

864
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,100
(The phone bell rings.)

865
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,710
- That's the phone.
- Hold on.

866
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,380
(Why on earth is the phone ringing?)

867
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,730
Hello?

868
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,940
(Others are bewildered,
but Jae Suk seems calm.)

869
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,590
Got it. Just a moment.

870
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,890
What is it?

871
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,630
I know what it was.

872
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,830
(What is he doing with the gourd?)

873
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,330
- What is that?
- What are you doing?

874
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,370
- Darn it!
- What are you doing?

875
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,340
- Throw it down hard.
- Well...

876
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,840
- Is this a personal mission?
- What?

877
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,950
- Is it a mission?
- Yes.

878
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,540
That must be it.
Maybe the price will go up.

879
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,750
Yes, that must be it.

880
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,380
(Back when Jae Suk
purchased his land)

881
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,550
(Seo-gu, Gwangju:
An unidentified beast appears.)

882
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,150
(Can be negated by breaking a gourd
with the head every hour)

883
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,760
(A piece of information was written
on the land certificate.)

884
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,530
(Some unfavorable conditions
can be negated.)

885
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,620
(Can be negated by breaking a gourd
with the head every hour)

886
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,940
(Unlike some lands with conditions
that can't be negated,)

887
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,830
(some lands have ways
to stabilize the price.)

888
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,520
(The owners will receive a call
as a reminder.)

889
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,070
I know what it was.

890
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,220
(He tries to negate
the negative effect.)

891
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,310
- What are you doing?
- Throw it down hard.

892
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:00,150
(If he does this, he can negate
the negative effect at noon.)

893
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,620
- Maybe the price will go up.
- Yes, that must be it.

894
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,200
- Darn it.
- Once more. You've got it.

895
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,030
(He broke the gourd.)

896
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,470
(Can be negated by breaking a gourd
with the head every hour)

897
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,630
Gosh, that hurts.

898
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,130
(He negated the effect.)

899
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,560
(Meanwhile, Suk Jin
tries to escape.)

900
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,940
This...

901
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,830
(Grunting)

902
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,610
(A sliding show)

903
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,490
It's slippery because of
the water I sprayed.

904
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,550
Jae Suk, one is enough.

905
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,960
What was with the one-man show?

906
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,030
- Darn you brats.
- Gosh, that hurts.

907
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,030
Pay up, Suk Jin.

908
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,030
You owe them and us
ten dollars each.

909
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,060
- Give me my ten dollars.
- Sure.

910
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
The phone is ringing again.

911
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,170
Why aren't I getting a phone call?

912
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,040
- Is there a phone in here?
- Is there a phone?

913
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,270
Do we all have phones?

914
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,740
- He must've bought one.
- Hello?

915
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,630
- Can you buy phones?
- How can you buy phones?

916
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
- Is there one in our briefcases?
- Got it.

917
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,340
Maybe it's only offered
to those in the top three.

918
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,780
Or maybe the top two.

919
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,020
Don't we get phones too?

920
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,070
What are you doing?

921
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,840
This must lead to a price jump.

922
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,520
The rest of us don't have phones.

923
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,650
It must be given to the top two.

924
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,720
Is it offered to those...

925
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,760
who bought land
with favorable conditions?

926
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,120
Why don't we join forces
and make ourselves some ramyeon?

927
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,500
- Then...
- Good idea.

928
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,360
Gather some money as payment, then.

929
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,770
- What?
- Gather some money as payment.

930
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,500
We'll provide the water.

931
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,330
You should include us too
since we can provide the water.

932
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,830
I'm selling this for five dollars.

933
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,100
Three dollars.

934
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,940
- Two dollars.
- One dollar.

935
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,510
How about 70 cents?

936
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,540
Is this how it's going to be?

937
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,340
- Hurry.
- Sell it for 50 cents.

938
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,520
Okay, 50 cents.

939
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,950
I'll definitely buy that.

940
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,150
- Okay.
- Us three should eat together.

941
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,050
This is all that I can do.

942
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,960
You...

943
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,150
It doesn't get me
in the mood though.

944
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,620
Why are you shaking that?

945
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,860
This is all that I can do.

946
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,200
I'll lose muscle at this rate.

947
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,400
Sitting all day will do that to me.

948
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,300
Get your lottery tickets!

949
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
- Get your lottery tickets.
- Lottery tickets?

950
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,830
Get your lottery tickets.

951
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,040
(The lottery ticket vendor
from Chungcheong Province)

952
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,340
- How much is it?
- It's...

953
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,640
ten dollars per ticket.

954
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,310
- I'll buy one.
- I'll buy one too.

955
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,950
- What is that?
- We have no choice.

956
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,950
Those who don't have assets
need to gamble with the lottery.

957
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,610
- What?
- What is that?

958
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,380
- These are lottery tickets.
- I'll take one!

959
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,260
- Lottery tickets?
- I'll take one.

960
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,320
- Each of you...
- I'll take three.

961
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,620
- Lottery tickets?
- I'll take one.

962
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,700
I'll take three.

963
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,050
- What?
- Ten dollars.

964
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,590
What on earth?

965
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,560
- He spilled his coffee.
- I'll take one.

966
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
- He spilled his coffee.
- What?

967
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,940
- He spilled his coffee.
- Darn it!

968
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,010
- Gosh.
- Unbelievable.

969
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,480
Can someone give me a towel?

970
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,480
I'm selling paper towels!

971
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,840
(Unfortunately, paper towels
are in Gwangju.)

972
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,040
I'm selling paper towels!

973
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,640
- How much is it?
- Ten dollars.

974
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,840
- How much is it?
- That'll be ten dollars.

975
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,790
Ten dollars? I'll take it all.

976
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,260
- I can't give you all of it.
- I need it to wipe this all up.

977
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,350
I'll offer you this much.

978
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,650
After all I did to get the coffee?

979
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,260
- That much for ten dollars?
- Yes.

980
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,790
That much for ten dollars?
It's not enough.

981
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,790
I'll give you what you need.

982
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,790
- The prize money is 200 dollars.
- Wait, 200 dollars?

983
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,590
- I'll take one. How much is it?
- Wait, 200 dollars per ticket?

984
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,200
- I'll choose mine.
- No, ten dollars per ticket.

985
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,590
I'll buy a ticket too.

986
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,060
- You can only buy one.
- Ten dollars.

987
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,130
- This...
- Here you go.

988
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,370
Here.

989
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,570
- There's a 1 in 4 chance.
- You can only buy one.

990
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,780
- Sorry?
- There's a 1 in 4 chance.

991
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,250
- A 1 in 4 chance?
- That's not too bad.

992
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,340
I hope I win the prize money.

993
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,040
The winning ticket will have
three of the same faces.

994
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,310
Three of the same faces.

995
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,720
Sounds good.

996
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,790
(They dream of turning
their lives around.)

997
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,190
Darn it.

998
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,880
- Mine's a dud.
- Can I buy one more?

999
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,230
- Can I?
- Jong Kook.

1000
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,760
- Mine's a dud.
- Here I go.

1001
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,850
- Jong Kook...
- I have the money to buy more.

1002
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,590
Suk Jin, darn it.

1003
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,390
- Darn, that was close.
- Mine's a dud.

1004
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,860
- Darn it.
- Yes!

1005
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,040
So Min, I won the prize
with three of your faces.

1006
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,630
- What?
- No way.

1007
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,880
- Unbelievable.
- You won the prize?

1008
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,440
This is the worst.

1009
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,750
Only the rich
get richer in this world.

1010
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,770
- Good for you.
- Nothing's working for me.

1011
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,420
How can only the rich
get richer in this world?

1012
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,420
- Haha, you!
- Only Ji Hyo won the prize.

1013
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,940
The ticket vendor will be back.

1014
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,550
- Mine's a dud.
- No way.

1015
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,550
- Ji Hyo.
- Did you really win the prize?

1016
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,860
- Yes, with So Min's faces.
- Lucky you.

1017
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,880
Why is she the only one
who is lucky among us?

1018
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,650
It's done!

1019
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,420
- Let's eat it with kimchi.
- Sure.

1020
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,500
Here you go.

1021
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,090
- This...
- This looks good.

1022
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,360
(Suk Jin is still
cleaning up the coffee.)

1023
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,130
Just look at this mess.

1024
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,630
Why did you spill coffee there?

1025
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,800
I didn't even get to take a sip.

1026
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,040
(Slurping)

1027
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,650
Just a second.
Should we make another?

1028
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,250
The ramyeon is to die for.

1029
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,980
Gosh, this is delicious.

1030
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,320
It's even better
because we're outdoors.

1031
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,960
Ramyeon tastes the best
when outdoors.

1032
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,020
Yes, outdoors.

1033
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,960
Those darn brats.

1034
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
(Those darn brats.)

1035
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,320
Did you cuss them out?

1036
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,920
What? Well, I couldn't help myself.

1037
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,460
Why did you cuss at us?

1038
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,690
What's so wrong
with cursing the rich?

1039
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,690
- The rich?
- You should've been smart...

1040
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,960
with your investments.

1041
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,300
A well exploded on my property.

1042
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,610
I bought the wrong kind of land.

1043
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,940
Water got pumped up
from below the surface.

1044
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,940
Let's ride it out, Suk Jin.

1045
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,480
Jong Kook.

1046
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,650
- Let's ride it out.
- We should join forces.

1047
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,480
- I can't take it anymore.
- I know.

1048
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,050
The towels are over here.

1049
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,050
You can buy some from Jong Kook.

1050
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,520
- Really?
- He has towels.

1051
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,590
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1052
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,050
Jong Kook, can you hand me
a towel? You and I should...

1053
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,860
- My head's spinning.
- What's wrong?

1054
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,860
What's wrong? What is it?

1055
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,090
I stood up too quickly.

1056
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,940
- Was it due to all the labor?
- Yes.

1057
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,440
- Can I have one?
- I feel for you.

1058
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,400
Right? Can I have a towel, then?

1059
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,940
You should offer me
something in exchange.

1060
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,110
What would you like to have?

1061
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,750
Bring me whatever you have.

1062
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,900
- Okay.
- I'll accept anything.

1063
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,920
Jong Kook, here.

1064
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,210
(So Min throws him
a triangular gimbap.)

1065
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,940
So Min, no way. My gosh.

1066
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,150
Jong Kook, that's for you.

1067
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,650
I'll give you this
in exchange for So Min's good deed.

1068
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,110
- Really?
- Yes.

1069
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,480
- You wanted a towel.
- Right. Thanks.

1070
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,650
I see we've split up into groups.

1071
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,420
- Right, you three are a team now.
- Right.

1072
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,090
Things are cozy enough
for them as well.

1073
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,860
I'm glad you've found
a way to survive.

1074
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,630
So Min, I felt your love just now.

1075
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,860
I'm going to make myself at home.

1076
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,230
You, me, and So Min should team up.

1077
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,750
Right, we should.

1078
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,710
If only you were situated
around here.

1079
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,750
If I get too annoyed,

1080
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,610
I'll buy the land in the center...

1081
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,960
and throw things as if
this were "Squid Game."

1082
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,250
- Like this.
- That you should.

1083
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,860
Ramyeon is the best
when there is barely enough.

1084
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,650
It tastes better
when eaten as a group of four.

1085
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,800
- Of course.
- Right?

1086
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,230
Having money sure is good.

1087
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,360
It's now time for you
to receive your first payments.

1088
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Okay.

1089
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,940
Bring in the status board.

1090
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,770
(Who earned the most money
from the land they had?)

1091
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,230
Why did Jong Kook lose money?

1092
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,230
(The status board is revealed.)

1093
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,940
(Land Appraisal at noon)

1094
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,750
(Favorable, Unfavorable)

1095
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,320
(Jong Kook's total profits at 12 p.m.)

1096
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,980
Jong Kook lost money.

1097
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,150
- Haha, you earned a lot.
- I earned 200 dollars.

1098
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,020
- Suk Jin too.
- This is how valuable...

1099
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,460
my land is.

1100
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,860
(Suk Jin's total profits at 12 p.m.)

1101
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,090
- Hold on a second.
- I can buy two more.

1102
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,670
I should purchase more.
It's all about investing now.

1103
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,730
- In total...
- So Min earned 400 dollars.

1104
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,630
(So Min's total profits at 12 p.m.)

1105
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,110
I earned a lot from my land.

1106
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,730
What did you purchase? Oh, Yongsan.

1107
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,440
In total, my profit is 300 dollars.

1108
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,880
You can purchase four more.

1109
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
(They turn their focus to So Min.)

1110
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,880
You'll receive your money
according to the status board.

1111
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,940
Thank you. Can I purchase
land from others now?

1112
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,420
Where should I buy next?

1113
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,710
I can't jump over Jong Kook
to go to the bathroom.

1114
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,090
- Darn it.
- If you can jump two at a time...

1115
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,230
If you can jump two at a time,

1116
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,420
- pay Ji Hyo ten dollars.
- And?

1117
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,630
I'll let you pass for free.

1118
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,520
- And then jump from here.
- I have a question.

1119
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,360
Can I buy someone else's land
if I want to?

1120
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,670
You can get that done
during the purchase phase.

1121
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,500
However, the price
will be 150 dollars.

1122
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,880
- One hundred fifty dollars?
- To purchase land owned by others?

1123
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,630
- That's right.
- But we can buy whatever we want.

1124
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,170
- Exactly.
- Which land should I buy?

1125
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,210
So Min, you bought two lands,
didn't you?

1126
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,520
I bought three.

1127
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,050
Yongsan and...

1128
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,750
- So Min got 400 dollars worth.
- Yes.

1129
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,050
- It's favorable.
- Right.

1130
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,960
So even if I buy So Min's land
for 150 dollars,

1131
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,420
- I'll have 50 dollars more later.
- You'll have more.

1132
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,670
So I must buy two lands of hers.

1133
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,130
The same goes for Suk Jin's land.

1134
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,130
What does he have?

1135
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,630
Oh, you should buy Suk Jin's land.

1136
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,110
You'll get extra 50 dollars
no matter what.

1137
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,500
(The price of Dong-gu, Ulsan, will
plunge unlike their expectations.)

1138
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,070
You'll get extra 50 dollars
no matter what.

1139
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,880
- It must be favorable. Yes.
- Yes.

1140
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,270
Please. I only have this one.

1141
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,610
- Pardon?
- It's 50 dollars.

1142
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,690
What about 50 dollars?

1143
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,880
- You should give it to me. Yes.
- I should give it to you?

1144
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,960
If the price goes down,

1145
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
- should I pay?
- Yes.

1146
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,960
It's my land.

1147
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,550
It's actually a tax.

1148
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,690
Really?

1149
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,250
When someone buys our land,
will I get the money?

1150
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,630
- No, it's not like that.
- Gosh, what's this?

1151
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,500
Are you a communist or what?

1152
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,690
- You pay taxes for everything.
- When someone buys my land,

1153
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,000
- shouldn't I get the money?
- What?

1154
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,630
- Who takes it then?
- Who takes it?

1155
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,980
- Us.
- It's not reasonable.

1156
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,340
- You should give it to him.
- Hey.

1157
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,940
What kind of country is this?

1158
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,320
We bought the land.

1159
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,610
- It belongs to the country.
- Then...

1160
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,440
- it's better not to buy it.
- Right.

1161
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,320
- Tell them.
- Then...

1162
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,150
- Hear me out.
- It doesn't make sense.

1163
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,420
We built the infrastructure
for you to eat and sleep.

1164
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,860
- Infrastructure?
- Come on.

1165
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,150
- This is...
- Does it make sense?

1166
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,150
The one who sold it
should get the money.

1167
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,170
- It's like we...
- We can pay taxes.

1168
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,570
- A real estate transfer tax.
- We can pay taxes.

1169
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,860
We can pay a transfer tax.

1170
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,940
If I sell it for 150 dollars,
I can pay 50 dollars.

1171
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,940
- I mean...
- You're right.

1172
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,340
You can trade yourselves then.

1173
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,670
- Can we?
- You can do it yourselves.

1174
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,270
Without us, the real estate agency.

1175
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,300
- If we do it ourselves...
- Without commission?

1176
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,340
(They can trade
without the real estate agency.)

1177
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,750
Won't you be arrested
if you trade without paying taxes?

1178
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,650
- Jong Kook.
- Without commission?

1179
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,480
Jong Kook.

1180
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,020
I'll buy your land for 100 dollars.

1181
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,360
Do you want to buy my land?

1182
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,980
- Will you give me 100 dollars?
- Yes.

1183
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,590
- That'd be great.
- That's why. Sell it to me.

1184
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,920
- I'll buy it.
- It sounds good.

1185
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,520
- Really?
- I want to buy that land.

1186
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,840
Okay. If you buy it for 100 dollars,
I can buy another land.

1187
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,000
I'll buy it for 100 dollars.

1188
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,460
(Dong-gu, Ulsan: 200 dollars up
at 12 p.m., 300 dollars down at 1 p.m.)

1189
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,000
(It's getting close to 1 p.m. now.)

1190
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,710
(Suk Jin needs to sell his land
quickly.)

1191
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,340
For your information,

1192
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,210
it's 150 dollars with the agency.

1193
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,550
But I'll sell it for 120 dollars.

1194
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,150
If you're going to buy it...

1195
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,820
I should get it for 120 dollars.

1196
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,090
How about 130 dollars?

1197
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,520
I'll get it for 120 dollars.

1198
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,130
- You should give me 130 dollars.
- Suk Jin.

1199
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,290
- I'll buy it for 130 dollars.
- Okay. 130 dollars.

1200
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,650
- How about 140 dollars?
- For 140 dollars?

1201
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,000
I say 150 dollars.
No more than that.

1202
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,360
- For 150 dollars?
- For 150 dollars.

1203
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,630
It's better to buy it
with the agency then.

1204
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,800
- I'm not buying it.
- Because he will...

1205
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,340
I should pay the agency
for nothing then.

1206
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,770
That's better. It's better for him
to buy it from them.

1207
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,630
I know. That's why
he wants to sell it to me.

1208
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,130
- But I don't know why.
- Sell it to me.

1209
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,550
Why do you want to buy that land?

1210
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,710
(Killing the mood)

1211
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,550
Because it will go up
by 200 dollars.

1212
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,020
There are so many unexplored lands.

1213
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,090
There are a lot of good factors.

1214
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,250
Why would you want to buy it
when there are many good factors?

1215
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,190
It's because I know
I will gain from the land.

1216
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,290
It's because I know
I will gain from the land.

1217
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,380
You should buy this kind of land
for 50 dollars.

1218
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,190
- There are other lands.
- I know.

1219
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,960
- Buy something else then.
- I'll pay 50 dollars.

1220
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,520
You should give me
the original price at least.

1221
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
I can't.

1222
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,770
They will take it then.

1223
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,570
- I won't buy it.
- They will take it.

1224
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,840
There's an order here.

1225
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,860
- All right.
- Okay.

1226
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,300
It's better to sell it and get money
than to be taken away from me.

1227
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,900
I think I should buy the land
to block people from the restroom.

1228
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,210
It's 7 of us, right?
I'm 6th place again.

1229
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,840
What's wrong?

1230
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,020
- Are you 6th?
- I'm 5th.

1231
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,790
What's wrong with us today?

1232
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,980
This is weird.

1233
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,920
I'm one rank higher than you.

1234
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,820
(Bitter)

1235
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,360
Wait. But it's...

1236
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,670
Didn't you give them out?

1237
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,730
I should pick them.
Why did you give them out?

1238
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,690
They asked me to do so.

1239
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,570
But Myung Jae...

1240
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,800
I'm sorry,
but don't we have to pick this?

1241
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,800
- Myung Jae gave these out.
- Even if it's just 100 dollars...

1242
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,940
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1243
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,150
- Myung Jae gave these out.
- That's true.

1244
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,820
- We should pick them.
- Hey.

1245
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,210
Lee Myung Jae.

1246
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,750
- No. Why?
- We should do it again.

1247
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,710
- Why?
- Right. Because Myung Jae...

1248
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,920
- We should pick them ourselves.
- Yes.

1249
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,750
I'm fine with doing it again.
Mine isn't that good.

1250
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,920
- Let's do it again.
- Myung Jae...

1251
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,090
- I don't...
- Those who want to do it again,

1252
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,250
do it again.

1253
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,860
(Then those who want to do it again,
do it again!)

1254
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,520
(1st place will step out of it.)

1255
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,520
- I mean...
- What is your rank?

1256
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,270
- I'm first.
- What's your rank?

1257
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,300
- I'm first.
- Myung Jae...

1258
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,500
- I'm not doing it again.
- You guys can switch.

1259
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,540
I'm first.

1260
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,040
- No.
- I can buy the land, right?

1261
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,440
Okay, I got it.

1262
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,480
- Myung Jae.
- Darn it.

1263
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,250
Come over here and cook something.

1264
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,250
Eat.

1265
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,420
It's all yours.

1266
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,050
Come over to the fridge and eat.

1267
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,710
- So Min, give me 100 dollars then.
- Okay.

1268
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,820
- You can give me the land deed.
- Okay.

1269
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,750
We're going to trade now. Can I go?

1270
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,250
You can go when it's for a trade.

1271
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,150
- Is it okay?
- He said it's okay.

1272
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,270
- Thank you.
- Thank you for 100 dollars.

1273
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,340
- I should've not bought it.
- A hundred dollars is still good.

1274
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,400
What did you say?

1275
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,840
If they don't go to the restroom...

1276
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,440
They should go to the restroom.

1277
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,900
How can I have five people who want
to use the restroom every hour?

1278
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,400
That's...

1279
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,320
I heard it's on sale.

1280
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,820
- How about 50 dollars?
- I want 100 dollars.

1281
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,270
A hundred is a little...

1282
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,550
- Give 100 dollars to me.
- Because...

1283
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,110
He has too little money anyway.

1284
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,460
- I don't have money.
- I said no.

1285
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,650
I got 200 dollars.

1286
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,050
How about 40 dollars?

1287
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,790
I can't sell it for 40 dollars.

1288
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,820
- Okay, then.
- Because something good...

1289
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,500
- will happen later.
- I should buy three lands.

1290
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,690
Let's go with 40 dollars.
I'll give you 10 dollars later.

1291
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,270
- Then bring 40 dollars.
- Yes.

1292
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:56,940
Gosh, 40 dollars?

1293
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,940
It's 40.

1294
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,860
I'll trade right away.

1295
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,480
(He's acting
until right before making the deal.)

1296
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,670
Here's 40 dollars.

1297
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,750
(The 40-dollar deal is made.)

1298
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,770
We made a contract.

1299
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:09,980
I should go down.

1300
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,270
- This land.
- I should expand from here.

1301
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,440
This is my land.

1302
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,880
Give me the deed.

1303
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,420
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

1304
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,050
Darn it.

1305
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,650
(Dong-gu, Ulsan: 200 dollars up
at 12 p.m., 300 dollars down at 1 p.m.)

1306
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,770
(Laughing)

1307
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:26,960
Why?

1308
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,940
(So happy)

1309
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,270
This became minus.

1310
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,440
He sold the land.

1311
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,570
(It will decrease
by 300 dollars per hour.)

1312
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,110
I was so nervous and worried
that he might not buy it.

1313
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,130
What did you say?

1314
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,710
I finally sold that land.

1315
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,320
You got a weird one, didn't you?

1316
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,570
It must be minus.

1317
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:46,320
- Make a deal, Jae Suk.
- We made a contract.

1318
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,210
- I should expand from here.
- I think some lands...

1319
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,860
- I should expand from here. Right.
- The price of some lands goes down.

1320
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,730
There must be land
with an oil field.

1321
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,420
- The land 1,000 dollars worth?
- I should find the golden land.

1322
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,400
Excuse me.

1323
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,500
Are you a gangster
around the neighborhood?

1324
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,070
My land is sold.

1325
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,460
- Is it sold?
- I don't have any place to stay.

1326
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,670
I should buy one too.

1327
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:06,940
I'll buy these.

1328
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,570
Gwangjin-gu, Geumcheon-gu,
and Nam-gu.

1329
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,710
Gwangjin-gu, Seoul.

1330
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,980
Is it done?

1331
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,750
- Oh, my gosh.
- I should buy it.

1332
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,790
(He found the land
that is 400 dollars.)

1333
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:20,840
- Me?
- Why?

1334
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,020
- Oh, my.
- Why?

1335
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,790
- You must hit a jackpot.
- This is a jackpot.

1336
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,150
(What is it?)

1337
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,480
- Why is he overreacting?
- Oh, my gosh.

1338
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,500
- Why?
- It's a jackpot.

1339
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,650
Which land is it?

1340
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,730
- Oh, my.
- How many did you get?

1341
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,360
He's rich. A rich landowner.

1342
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,840
Haha's land.

1343
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,090
I guess there's something.

1344
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,230
I got to move into this area.

1345
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,570
(Jae Suk's overreaction
shakes the real estate world.)

1346
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,040
- I picked good ones.
- Whose is it?

1347
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,400
It's Jae Suk.

1348
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,650
(Super excited
about extra 50 dollars)

1349
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,380
(Geumcheon-gu, Seoul: 50 dollars up
by 12 p.m., 1 p.m., 2 p.m., 3 p.m.)

1350
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,270
(He bought 3 and all 3 lands
have favorable conditions!)

1351
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,480
This is amazing.

1352
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,340
(It makes those in the lower ranks
feel deprived.)

1353
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,460
- Where are you moving into?
- Yes?

1354
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,790
- Sorry?
- Where are you moving into?

1355
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:58,880
You can see it.

1356
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,480
(The rich landowner got excited.)

1357
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,460
(The middle-aged rich guy
loves this world so much.)

1358
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,460
Is it that good?

1359
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,670
He might be acting.

1360
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,800
- It could be acting. We don't know.
- I picked good ones for now.

1361
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,670
Jae Suk has too much land.

1362
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,110
- Jae Suk's land...
- He's a rich landowner.

1363
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,300
Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu,
and Eunpyeong-gu.

1364
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,840
That one is good.

1365
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,550
I thought the land near the forest
would be obviously nice.

1366
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,980
Honestly,

1367
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,480
I'm buying the areas
I want to live in.

1368
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,050
I'll get it.

1369
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,460
I'm screwed. What should I do?
I'm in trouble.

1370
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,790
I'm screwed. The price went down.
I'm in trouble.

1371
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,880
(Gangnam-gu, Seoul is unfavorable.)

1372
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,130
This is bad. What do I do?

1373
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,360
(Seocho-gu: 50 dollars up at 12 p.m.
and 1 p.m., 300 dollars down at 2 p.m.)

1374
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,630
I'm in trouble.
I should sell Seocho-gu quickly.

1375
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,040
This one is better. Eunpyeong-gu.

1376
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,500
I shouldn't buy the areas in Seoul.

1377
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,070
Thank you.

1378
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,300
It's done. It's good.

1379
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,270
I'll buy Gangseo-gu and Jung-gu.

1380
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:57,880
What?

1381
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,880
(Gangseo-gu, Seoul: 300 dollars down
at 12 p.m., 1 p.m., 2 p.m., and 3 p.m.)

1382
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,980
(Even the virtual world
is affected by Suk Jin.)

1383
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,290
Hey, Gangnam isn't popular here.

1384
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,090
Mapo-gu, Songpa-gu,
and Haeundae-gu, Busan.

1385
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:15,190
(He just bought the areas he likes
regardless of the conditions.)

1386
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,040
(Haeundae-gu: 300 dollars down
at 12 p.m., 1 p.m., 2 p.m., and 3 p.m.)

1387
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,300
(Songpa-gu: 100 dollars up at 12 p.m.,
1 p.m., 200 down at 2 p.m., 3 p.m.)

1388
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,170
What? Why?

1389
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,770
(Songpa-gu: 100 dollars up at 12 p.m.,
1 p.m., 200 down at 2 p.m., 3 p.m.)

1390
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:22,900
Gosh.

1391
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,270
Oh, no.

1392
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,250
- Why?
- Jae Suk must've gotten good ones.

1393
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,920
Yes. He bought some great ones.

1394
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,710
- We should get his land.
- But...

1395
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,380
Jae Suk is taking the lead.
Why does he have so much?

1396
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:35,860
Because...

1397
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,480
- He had some land at first.
- The price of the land increased.

1398
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,050
You guys should know.

1399
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,650
You should buy as much land
as possible to make money.

1400
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:46,000
- Is that so?
- Think about it.

1401
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,300
- It goes up by 200 or 300 dollars.
- Right. The price goes up.

1402
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,110
But I don't have any land.

1403
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,400
Even if you have cash,
it means nothing.

1404
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,980
- But...
- You should buy land.

1405
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,440
- The price goes down as well.
- I know.

1406
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,210
I'm sorry, but you don't know what
it's like for those who got nothing.

1407
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,020
- Have you ever not had any land?
- I don't have money to buy it.

1408
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,340
- Have you...
- That's my land.

1409
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,480
It's okay for now.
Have you ever had no land?

1410
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,750
This is my land, mister.

1411
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,050
The poor ones don't even have money
to buy land.

1412
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,960
So that's why I'm telling you
that you should invest.

1413
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,650
Yes, but I don't have money
to buy land.

1414
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,900
- So...
- Give me some money then!

1415
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,000
(Give me some money then!)

1416
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,190
You should give me some money then.

1417
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,300
You should've done better earlier.
Why did you do a bad job?

1418
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,570
It's not because I did a bad job.

1419
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,500
Is it something I can do well?

1420
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,460
- Don't talk with him. Come here.
- You should've done well.

1421
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,770
- My goodness.
- Let's go. You're fifth, right?

1422
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,000
- I'm fifth.
- Buy land.

1423
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,170
Goodness gracious.

1424
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:35,880
He's saying that I should invest
when I'm worrying about surviving.

1425
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,380
You can survive just with protein.

1426
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,920
- Why are you complaining?
- My gosh.

1427
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,460
Mister,
which area do you have over there?

1428
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,690
- Are you going to buy it?
- Wait.

1429
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,290
- Where?
- I'll just buy Seo-gu, Gwangju.

1430
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,190
- Which land did you say?
- I should survive at least.

1431
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,520
(Seo-gu, Gwangju?)

1432
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,270
(Seo-gu, Gwangju
that Jong Kook chose is...)

1433
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,270
(Seo-gu, Gwangju: 300 dollars down
at 12 p.m., 1 p.m., 2 p.m., and 3 p.m.)

1434
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,800
(The only land
whose price will plummet)

1435
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,040
(He tried to think of a way
to sell it.)

1436
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,980
You're going to buy it?

1437
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,500
- Seo-gu, Gwangju?
- It's...

1438
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,270
You would have nowhere to go.

1439
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,110
Forget it.

1440
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,050
- Anyway, Jong Kook will...
- I can just give you 150 dollars.

1441
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,550
Finally, the Squid Game has started.

1442
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,980
(The Squid Game has started.)

1443
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,920
- Why?
- Round two.

1444
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,190
The Squid Game.

1445
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,130
Someone will be eliminated and die.

1446
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,690
Why would you want to buy
Seo-gu, Gwangju?

1447
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,690
Excuse me?

1448
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,730
I'm telling you.
Surviving is my priority.

1449
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,800
- Did you buy it?
- Yes.

1450
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,840
- I...
- Where?

1451
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,960
Give me the land deed, sir.

1452
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,400
- Give me Seo-gu.
- Gosh, this is...

1453
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,210
Hurry up.

1454
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,070
- Now I...
- My goodness.

1455
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:42,820
don't have to worry about surviving.

1456
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,550
This is the one for Seo-gu, Gwangju.

1457
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,210
- But you should be careful.
- Why?

1458
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,750
- Why?
- It doesn't feel good.

1459
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,820
(Seo-gu, Gwangju: 300 dollars down
at 12 p.m., 1 p.m., 2 p.m., and 3 p.m.)

1460
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,190
The land doesn't feel good.

1461
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,190
Okay.

1462
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,730
He's helping me.

1463
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,820
- Mister, it doesn't feel good.
- Yes.

1464
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,800
So only the rich will be richer.

1465
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,340
The poor will stay poor.

1466
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,960
This is why...

1467
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,400
ordinary people are just watching
others making money.

1468
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,710
I guess you were very hungry.

1469
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:18,380
I'll buy Jung-gu, Busan
and Yeongdeungpo-gu. The two.

1470
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,440
I'll get them.
I should go to the restroom.

1471
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,480
(He might have to pee quickly.
He bought the land near the restroom.)

1472
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,520
Please be a jackpot.

1473
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,150
Please be favorable.

1474
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,690
I'm going to turn the tables
with a favorable land.

1475
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,920
(Checking the deed
after a deep breath)

1476
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,090
After going up once,
it will keep going down.

1477
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,300
(The price will plunge again later.)

1478
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,540
(Jung-gu: 200 dollars up at 12 p.m.,
1 p.m., 400 down at 2 p.m., 3 p.m.)

1479
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,770
Jung-gu, Busan.

1480
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,570
(He needs to sell it quickly again.)

1481
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,710
(Jung-gu: 200 dollars up at 12 p.m.,
1 p.m., 400 down at 2 p.m., 3 p.m.)

1482
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,880
Can I take it back?

1483
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,570
It's past 12, right?

1484
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,650
I'll go crazy after that.

1485
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:50,980
Gosh.

1486
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,980
(On top of that, the price
of Yeongdeungpo-gu doesn't change.)

1487
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,090
For real?

1488
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,650
This is annoying.

1489
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,150
How can I sell it? I don't think
I can sell it as I sold one earlier.

1490
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,960
This is terrible.

1491
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,190
I want to go to the restroom though.

1492
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,420
When I have to go...

1493
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:10,270
I can't go to the restroom.

1494
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,340
It's my turn.

1495
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,270
I can't go
because I don't have money.

1496
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,040
I can go to the bathroom now.

1497
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,630
- Ji Hyo, I'll pay ten dollars.
- Yes?

1498
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,380
- I can pass then.
- Yes.

1499
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,250
Then...

1500
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,480
I signed a memorandum of understanding
with Jong Kook, so... Wait.

1501
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,650
Did someone buy this land?

1502
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,650
(The owner of Yeongdo-gu, Busan
has changed.)

1503
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:29,920
Who bought this area?

1504
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,980
Who? Is it you?

1505
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,150
- Why did you buy it?
- She bought it.

1506
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,460
I paid a lot.

1507
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,070
- For 150 dollars?
- No. For 100 dollars.

1508
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,190
Geumcheon-gu, Seoul.

1509
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,130
If so...

1510
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,460
(He paid ten dollars to check
the information of Geumcheon-gu.)

1511
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,710
I'll pay ten dollars
to use it first.

1512
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:50,670
(The reason why Se Chan asks for
information about Jae Suk's land)

1513
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,440
(Jae Suk was making a fuss
when buying the land.)

1514
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:58,270
(Rich Jae Suk's land purchase
stirred up the people.)

1515
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,610
(Jae Suk cheered 3 times
while checking 3 lands.)

1516
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,920
(Se Chan was staring at Jae Suk
in the meantime.)

1517
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,290
(He paid ten dollars
to check the information.)

1518
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,360
This one?
This is about Geumcheon-gu?

1519
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,730
(What?)

1520
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:14,170
Why did he shout then?
It's nothing much.

1521
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,090
(It's not as big as he thought.)

1522
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:19,270
It's not a big deal.

1523
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,440
Guys, if you give me
just ten dollars...

1524
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,610
so that I can buy lottery tickets...

1525
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,170
- I...
- If I win...

1526
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,500
I'll get Jung-gu, Daegu.

1527
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,800
Jung-gu, Ulsan.
The unfavorable factor will be gone.

1528
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,940
Whose land?

1529
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,610
Yes? It's over.

1530
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,550
- It's over.
- Guys.

1531
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,320
I really have to buy
lottery tickets.

1532
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,190
- I have 20 dollars.
- Just give me 10 dollars.

1533
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,130
- What?
- I'll pay back.

1534
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,050
Dunk your head in there.

1535
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:44,690
(The loan condition of Se Chan Bank
is quite unique.)

1536
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,730
- What?
- Dunk your head in there.

1537
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,630
Then I'll give you ten dollars.

1538
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,000
- Will you give me ten dollars?
- Yes.

1539
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:51,540
Dunk your head completely.

1540
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,130
(Haha desperately needs ten dollars
as lottery is his only hope.)

1541
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,500
You little punk.

1542
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,670
Hold on.

1543
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:02,770
(Screaming)

1544
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:05,380
(A bald head shampoo show)

1545
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,880
What? Is he doing a mission?

1546
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,880
Hey.

1547
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,590
The water will turn black as you
paint your head with a marker.

1548
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,050
- He's doing a fun mission.
- I said I'd give you money later.

1549
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,650
- Haha, when I get the lottery...
- Give it to me.

1550
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,630
I don't know.

1551
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,670
Is your mission to dunk your head?

1552
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:27,710
(In "Running Man" world,
they fool others for ten dollars.)

1553
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,840
Give ten dollars to me, you punk.

1554
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,750
You said you would give me
ten dollars if I dunk my head.

1555
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,670
And you really did it?

1556
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,070
Hurry up. Give it to me.

1557
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:39,190
I don't have money.

1558
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,690
(So Min's phone is ringing
at that moment.)

1559
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,150
Why does everyone have
a phone except for me?

1560
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:46,880
- Hello.
- Bad news is coming.

1561
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,730
Why do I not have a phone?
Does everyone have one?

1562
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,820
I guess only some people have one.

1563
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,170
I guess it's optional
depending on the land they have.

1564
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,090
Depending on the land?

1565
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:57,770
- It comes with the land.
- I see.

1566
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,130
- I'm so full.
- What is she doing?

1567
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:04,170
(Strike bodybuilding poses every
30 minutes to remove a bad factor.)

1568
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,800
She did it earlier.
She did it while looking at me.

1569
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,550
(Strike bodybuilding poses every
30 minutes to remove a bad factor.)

1570
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,650
What is that?

1571
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,170
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1572
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,650
You're good, So Min.

1573
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,320
She's good.
It seems she's done it many times.

1574
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,460
(He suddenly gets up.)

1575
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,790
Can you not use the air fryer?

1576
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,020
It must work.

1577
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,250
Can I use the air fryer too?

1578
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,690
- Which one?
- Can I use the air fryer for this?

1579
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,270
- Yes.
- Of course, you can.

1580
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,590
Do you want to eat
crunchy fried chicken?

1581
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:30,590
Yes.

1582
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,570
What are you doing all of a sudden?
Why are you dancing?

1583
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,570
For some reason.

1584
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:37,230
It's convenient to use a microwave.

1585
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,400
- Hello.
- Hey.

1586
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,250
- There are two. Okay, I got it.
- I used it well.

1587
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,980
- No, I won't change.
- You won't change?

1588
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,980
- No.
- Yongsan-gu seems nice.

1589
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,170
I'll sell it for 140 dollars.

1590
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,150
What? I don't have 140 dollars.

1591
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,340
I'll sell it for 140 dollars.

1592
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,090
I said, I don't have money.

1593
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,250
What are you doing, Se Chan?

1594
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,290
What are you doing?

1595
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,300
Don't worry about me.

1596
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,300
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1597
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,400
What is it?

1598
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,460
- Get lost.
- What is it?

1599
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,400
- Why?
- Don't mind me.

1600
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,860
- What are you doing?
- Get lost.

1601
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,360
I must do this.

1602
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,500
(Shaking off the bad factor)

1603
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,840
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

1604
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,500
This is not a weird thing.

1605
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,920
- Don't mind me.
- What are you doing?

1606
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,290
It's not something weird. I'm done.

1607
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:23,210
After some time,
the price will go up again.

1608
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,980
Many people are saying that
they're not going to the restroom.

1609
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,320
Don't turn the cameras off.

1610
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,690
So Min bought all the land
we should pass to use the restroom.

1611
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,050
She bought them all.

1612
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:32,820
The restroom is meaningless.

1613
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,630
You can pay me and go.

1614
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,940
- What?
- Pay me and go to the bathroom.

1615
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,070
Hold on.

1616
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,210
So Min would be the most annoyed...

1617
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,270
when I give Ji Hyo ten dollars...

1618
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:48,480
and skip those three areas
to use the restroom.

1619
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,920
- Right. If you get the middle one.
- Jae Suk.

1620
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,790
I have Nam-gu, Busan,
so if I buy Dongnae-gu...

1621
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,210
and give Ji Hyo ten dollars...

1622
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,190
to skip those areas,
that'd be the best.

1623
00:55:58,190 --> 00:55:59,230
Where?

1624
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:01,380
That will make So Min
annoyed the most.

1625
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,550
Seriously.

1626
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,300
Let's trade. The real estate.

1627
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,400
Take my land...

1628
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,690
- and give me one.
- How about 20 dollars?

1629
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,540
Let's switch ones with good factors.

1630
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,070
Then I'll show you Haeundae-gu.

1631
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:15,840
- You've heard about Jung-gu, Busan?
- Yes.

1632
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,130
It's a favorable area.
So I want to switch with a good one.

1633
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,800
You'll get money
as soon as it becomes 1 p.m.

1634
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,170
- Can I get money from your land?
- Mine is the same.

1635
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,070
- Is it? Right away?
- Yes.

1636
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,150
- Shall we switch then?
- Yes.

1637
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,290
- Haeundae-gu?
- Yes.

1638
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,150
Then I'll change Haeundae-gu
with mine.

1639
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,880
- Switch then.
- Switch.

1640
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,980
Exchange.

1641
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,190
Yes. Thank you.

1642
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,520
This isn't good or bad.

1643
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,190
I'll...

1644
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,090
(Haeundae-gu, Busan: 300 dollars down at
12 p.m., 1 p.m., 2 p.m., and 3 p.m.)

1645
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:42,270
(The unfavorable blue land)

1646
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,940
If it's a minus...

1647
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,770
Can you lie?

1648
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,980
You can't lie.

1649
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,270
- Who?
- Hey.

1650
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,270
What kind of land is this?

1651
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,570
You shouldn't lie.

1652
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,290
Gosh, this is...

1653
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,380
- It's hilarious.
- Hello.

1654
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:03,820
Why? What did they tell you to do?

1655
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,380
Okay, I got it.

1656
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,820
- What did they tell you to do?
- Oh, my.

1657
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:09,820
(Suk Jin who was curious about
others' calls got the first call.)

1658
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,420
- Come on. Let me see.
- I can't show you.

1659
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,360
It must be hula.

1660
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,360
What are you doing?

1661
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,670
Does he have to do hula
because he got it from me?

1662
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,130
That was mine.

1663
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,880
What are you doing?

1664
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,650
I can see your armpit hair.

1665
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,840
This is annoying.

1666
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,790
I'll give you 300 dollars
if you buy Haeundae-gu.

1667
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:35,790
(Haeundae-gu is annoying
in many ways.)

1668
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,610
I'll give it to you if you take it.

1669
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,380
The welfare of this country...

1670
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,690
- Come on.
- Darn it. I hate that.

1671
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:42,690
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

1672
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,800
Go to the restroom
if you want to poop.

1673
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,800
Stop, Se Chan. It's disgusting.

1674
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,570
- Don't do that.
- Get lost.

1675
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,000
- Are you twerking?
- Go over there, will you?

1676
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,460
- Gosh.
- Hey.

1677
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,130
- Why?
- Go over there.

1678
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:56,270
Why? I should do this.

1679
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:57,270
How dare you...

1680
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,610
(Jong Kook who has Seo-gu, Gwangju
removed the bad factor as well.)

1681
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,650
- What is it?
- I had to break the gourd.

1682
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,250
Why do they have missions?

1683
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,690
One of my lands
became a dumping ground.

1684
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,210
Isn't this Nanji Island?

1685
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,380
It became...

1686
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,290
(The owner of the land started
throwing trash thoughtlessly.)

1687
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,820
(Everyone mistook it
as a dumping ground.)

1688
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,150
- Stop throwing trash in my land.
- I didn't make it like this.

1689
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,800
- It was always like this.
- Hey.

1690
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,820
Hey.

1691
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:23,770
What are you doing?

1692
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,040
- What's that?
- What's that?

1693
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,900
- Why does she keep doing it?
- What is it?

1694
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,340
- Why does she keep doing it?
- What is she doing?

1695
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,900
She's good.

1696
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,300
- Gosh.
- She's good though.

1697
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,300
She is good.

1698
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,650
- So Min.
- I hate that so much.

1699
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,250
- So Min does it well.
- She is good.

1700
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,440
- She must have done it before.
- She has the right expression.

1701
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:38,840
It's 1 p.m.

1702
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,980
(It's time for the second payout.)

1703
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,020
The profits will be revealed.

1704
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,290
The profits.

1705
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:45,210
Let's see.

1706
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,420
(Jae Suk's total profits at 1 p.m.:
80 dollars)

1707
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,550
- I made 0 dollars.
- I made 0 dollars too.

1708
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,920
(Jong Kook and Suk Jin
got rid of the bad factors.)

1709
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,300
- How about me?
- You made 45 dollars.

1710
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:58,000
It isn't half bad.

1711
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,610
Haha has the best lands.

1712
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,230
- So Min made a lot of money.
- Haha.

1713
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,170
Before the purchase,

1714
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:06,250
- you will have a mission.
- Okay.

1715
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,800
Here comes the mission.

1716
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,380
Will this decide the rankings?

1717
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,710
Yes, this will decide the rankings.

1718
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,150
- Good.
- You will receive money too.

1719
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,480
- We will receive money too.
- Let's go.

1720
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,550
- Please gather around.
- All right.

1721
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,790
This isn't easy.

1722
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,550
Don't you guys want to use
the restroom?

1723
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,420
Suk Jin.

1724
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,090
I am holding it in like crazy.

1725
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,860
- I am waiting, but no one is going.
- No one is going.

1726
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,460
- I will explain the rules.
- Okay.

1727
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,130
It's a nice game for residents.

1728
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,190
- What is it?
- Soap Water Steal the Chairs.

1729
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,400
Soap Water Steal the Chairs.

1730
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:40,840
- One of the residents will rule.
- Jong Kook.

1731
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,250
Please make me 2nd or 3rd place.

1732
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,550
- You know...
- Jong Kook.

1733
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,980
Jong Kook can make that happen.

1734
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:46,790
- That's incredible.
- If you make me first place,

1735
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,340
I will give you
a land of your choice.

1736
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,050
All right. Music, cue.

1737
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:53,190
(Round 1 begins
with 7 people and 6 chairs.)

1738
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,420
I am not sure about this.

1739
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:57,400
- It won't be easy.
- We need to dance.

1740
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,500
Suk Jin.

1741
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,170
(Slipping)

1742
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:02,940
- It's insane.
- Be careful.

1743
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,900
Be careful.

1744
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,300
(The soapy floor is more slippery
than they thought.)

1745
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,670
Circle around.

1746
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,440
The floor is so slippery.

1747
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,980
- It's slippery.
- It's no joke.

1748
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,270
It's so slippery.

1749
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,980
Don't move the chairs in advance.

1750
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,820
- Haha, don't do that.
- What are you doing?

1751
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,710
(Singing)

1752
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,860
(They hum and pretend to know
the recent song.)

1753
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,750
- What's this song? It's nice.
- "Love Dive."

1754
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:30,690
- Please be considerate of...
- This is mine.

1755
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,400
- Okay.
- I sat down.

1756
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,630
(Jong Kook, Haha)

1757
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,690
I sat down.

1758
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:36,730
(Ji Hyo is okay.)

1759
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,900
All right.

1760
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:39,540
I sat down.

1761
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,170
(The rivals have met again.)

1762
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,340
- I sat down.
- Sit down on the chair.

1763
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:44,770
Sit down.

1764
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,570
- He sat down.
- Suk Jin.

1765
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,170
(The weakest members had
a fierce rival match.)

1766
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:50,710
So Min is last place.

1767
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,110
I am exhausted.

1768
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,550
(Both of them are exhausted.)

1769
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,090
- So Min.
- It went exactly as I predicted.

1770
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,460
I could have stolen it,
but Suk Jin...

1771
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,650
- It's hard.
- I will remove one chair.

1772
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,750
- This is hard.
- This is hard.

1773
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,520
Circle around the chairs once more.
Music, cue.

1774
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,300
- Let's go.
- This game isn't easy.

1775
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,690
(There are five chairs.)

1776
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:11,130
- It's "Tomboy."
- Tom!

1777
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,940
Tomboy

1778
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:17,270
It's "Tomboy."

1779
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:20,300
Tomboy

1780
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,670
(Whistling)

1781
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,520
I sat down.

1782
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:27,750
Tomboy

1783
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,590
I sat down.

1784
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:32,860
(Suk Jin goes against Haha
this time.)

1785
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,520
You must be on the soapy floor
when you sit on the chair.

1786
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,300
Who stole the chair?

1787
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:40,020
(Haha grabs the chair.)

1788
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:42,940
Suk Jin keeps being the target.

1789
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,800
- I keep being the target.
- I feel bad for him.

1790
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,130
(They make strange noises
as they play around.)

1791
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,070
- They are happy.
- Hey.

1792
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:54,750
- The neighbors get along well.
- They are happy.

1793
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,420
- They are happy.
- The neighbors get along well.

1794
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,820
- They are happy.
- What a friendship.

1795
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,150
Why don't we join forces...

1796
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,840
and steal Ji Hyo's chair?

1797
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,920
That's a good idea.

1798
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,690
- Are you targeting Ji Hyo now?
- Let me take it.

1799
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:07,190
- Let's go. I won't steal it.
- Let's go.

1800
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,880
- Let go.
- Let go.

1801
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,800
- Let's put it here.
- Give it to me.

1802
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,920
- Okay.
- Let's put it in front of So Min.

1803
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,020
We will get criticized
if we gang up on Ji Hyo.

1804
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,460
Why don't we attack Jae Suk?

1805
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:17,800
It's over once you sit on a chair.

1806
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,170
That's nonsense, you punk.

1807
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,400
Why are you swearing at me?

1808
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,270
- Why are you swearing at me?
- Why are you angry?

1809
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:23,730
Put yourself in my shoes.

1810
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,440
I have no money or land.

1811
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:26,840
I have nothing.

1812
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,050
(A father's desperate cry)

1813
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,150
- Shall we play a game?
- Rock-paper-scissors?

1814
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,670
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Okay. For real.

1815
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,940
- For real.
- I will give the chair...

1816
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:35,110
to the winner.

1817
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,980
- Okay.
- Give me the chair.

1818
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,650
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- I will do that.

1819
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,880
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1820
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,460
- Let's play Subtract One.
- Subtract One? Okay.

1821
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,150
- Come on.
- Your butt...

1822
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:46,320
- Rock-paper-scissors, subtract one
- Rock-paper-scissors, subtract one

1823
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,960
Rock-paper-scissors, subtract one

1824
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,020
(My goodness.)

1825
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,460
(Two scissors)

1826
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:53,270
He played two scissors.

1827
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,540
What?

1828
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,170
What's up with Suk Jin?

1829
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:57,300
(A father's surprise attack)

1830
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,500
What?

1831
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,000
What's up with Suk Jin?

1832
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,210
I can't believe Suk Jin.

1833
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,440
(Then he sits on the chair.)

1834
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,480
I can't believe Suk Jin.

1835
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,520
- Haha is out.
- Am I out?

1836
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,610
(Haha is out.)

1837
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:09,440
I can't believe him.

1838
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,520
- Suk Jin.
- Seriously.

1839
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,320
- I think you will be criticized.
- It's okay.

1840
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,290
That's life.

1841
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,300
- Don't upload this on YouTube.
- That's life.

1842
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,360
Don't upload this on YouTube.

1843
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,860
Haha's fans, I am sorry.

1844
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,690
I apologize.

1845
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,800
Seongsan Elementary School, rise!

1846
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,690
Now,

1847
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:27,230
it's time to pick 5th place
with 4 chairs.

1848
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:28,670
My goodness.

1849
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:30,070
All right. Music, cue.

1850
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,380
(Round 3 begins.)

1851
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:34,980
(It's Jae Suk's favorite song,
"Kiss Kiss" by LABOUM.)

1852
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,250
I will make your lips

1853
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,650
Shine

1854
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,420
(They dance
with tension in the air.)

1855
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,150
He got the chair.

1856
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:46,380
- You need to circle around.
- Circle around.

1857
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,880
You need to circle around. Come on.

1858
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,300
(It's their first time
seeing Suk Jin's passion.)

1859
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,960
Come on.

1860
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,500
(Slipping)

1861
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:01,110
(The timing of the whistle
was against Suk Jin.)

1862
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:02,360
What was that?

1863
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:04,540
What was that?

1864
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,770
What are you doing?

1865
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,110
Why are you grabbing my pants?

1866
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,070
- What's up with Suk Jin?
- What are you doing?

1867
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,920
- What's up with him?
- You punk.

1868
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,150
You will understand
if you are poor like me.

1869
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,020
(Kicking)

1870
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,460
Suk Jin is working hard.

1871
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,520
(My goodness.)

1872
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,070
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Why?

1873
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:30,360
- The chair is in my hand.
- For goodness' sake.

1874
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:33,440
(He suggests rock-paper-scissors
as if he is being generous.)

1875
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,210
- I can't believe him.
- I mean...

1876
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:38,670
(He attacks after a pause.)

1877
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,550
This middle-aged man is too much.

1878
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,050
- Mister.
- For goodness' sake.

1879
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,650
- He is a bully.
- What was that?

1880
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,170
He is too much.

1881
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,150
He stole the chair after asking
to play rock-paper-scissors.

1882
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,150
He is too much.

1883
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:52,710
- I am penniless. I am sorry.
- He is a bully.

1884
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:54,420
It's okay. It was pretty good.

1885
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,750
- It was pretty good.
- I agree.

1886
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,550
- You won't get criticized for that.
- Right?

1887
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:00,000
I am sorry,

1888
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,270
but are you the judge
on what gets criticized?

1889
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,540
- I think about...
- No!

1890
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:05,840
- what the viewers will say.
- Good.

1891
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,610
- He is a total bully.
- Okay.

1892
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,170
Okay. I admit it. I am a bully.

1893
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:11,270
Get ready.

1894
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:12,440
Music, cue.

1895
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,300
Ji Hyo, you are the target.
Be careful.

1896
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,210
Let's go.

1897
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:22,440
("Twist King" by Turbo)

1898
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,610
I love it.

1899
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:25,320
He is approaching me again.

1900
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:27,190
You need to circle around.

1901
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:30,420
(It's the perfect song
for dancing on the soapy floor.)

1902
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,460
(Look over there.)

1903
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:37,070
(An uninvited duo
crashed the dance floor.)

1904
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,400
(They have fun
regardless of the game.)

1905
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,540
All right.

1906
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:48,150
(Whistling)

1907
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:54,440
(Incredible speed)

1908
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,650
(Freeze)

1909
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:01,190
- That was...
- Are you serious?

1910
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:02,750
- He is good.
- Jong Kook.

1911
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,000
How does Suk Jin do that?
He is really good at this game.

1912
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,960
Jong Kook, you are out.

1913
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,400
Suk Jin showed a b-boying move.

1914
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,900
His freeze was impressive.

1915
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:13,130
(There is a reason why
he is so determined.)

1916
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,500
I don't have any money.

1917
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,000
I'm sorry, I must win.

1918
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,500
I will win!

1919
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,800
Did the price drop?

1920
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,880
(His investment
faced hardship from the start.)

1921
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,750
(Despite the younger members'
mistreatment and teasing,)

1922
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:31,420
(Suk Jin waited for his big break.)

1923
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,820
(Now is the only chance
to turn the tables.)

1924
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:38,050
(Suk Jin becomes competitive
once or twice a year.)

1925
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:41,690
(After 6 matches,)

1926
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:44,340
(he becomes the last one standing.)

1927
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,690
Suk Jin won!

1928
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:47,610
- Seriously.
- He has incredible willpower.

1929
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:48,770
For goodness' sake.

1930
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:50,170
He deserved to win.

1931
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,880
- He was determined.
- Good job.

1932
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,570
Please congratulate him.

1933
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:56,650
- Okay.
- I had nothing.

1934
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:59,110
Now, go back to your land...

1935
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,610
- or communal land.
- Let's go.

1936
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:03,110
Here it is. It's communal land.

1937
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:05,150
Shall I buy land now?

1938
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:07,630
Suk Jin became rich
thanks to the game.

1939
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:08,980
Suk Jin, you are rich.

1940
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,730
Please show me Yongsan-gu.

1941
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,250
I will give you ten dollars.

1942
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,670
(Whispering)

1943
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,920
(He checks information
on So Min's Yongsan-gu.)

1944
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,000
Here it is.

1945
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:18,940
Yongsan-gu.

1946
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,980
(Yongsan-gu, Seoul: 300 dollars up
at 2 p.m., 300 dollars up at 3 p.m.)

1947
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,300
I will buy this land.

1948
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,380
Yes. I will give you 150 dollars.

1949
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:32,550
(So Min's favorite place
gets demolished.)

1950
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:33,790
Who bought my land?

1951
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,710
Suk Jin?

1952
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:38,820
Suk Jin, you suddenly bought
my land.

1953
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,750
I could have sold it to you
for a cheaper price.

1954
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:43,520
- Jung-gu.
- Jung-gu, Daegu?

1955
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,000
- It's Se Chan's, right?
- Yes.

1956
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,190
(He checks information
on Se Chan's Jung-gu, Daegu.)

1957
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:49,940
I will buy Jung-gu.

1958
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:52,730
(He purchases the land
upon checking the good factors.)

1959
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:53,860
Jung-gu.

1960
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,570
Why does Suk Jin look
so greedy today?

1961
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,670
Today,

1962
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:03,980
- he is showing his greedy side.
- He is being greedy today.

1963
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,610
- He is showing his greedy side.
- Seriously.

1964
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,610
Look at his back.

1965
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,420
- Look at his back.
- Hey.

1966
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,360
Suk Jin isn't listening to us.

1967
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,290
Is Bupyeong-gu okay?

1968
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,360
I will take chances.

1969
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,150
I don't have much money.
I will buy it.

1970
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:22,590
He is ambitious. He wants to win.

1971
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:23,800
You know,

1972
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:25,690
my power is coming out.

1973
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:27,900
I wanted to go to the restroom
from the start,

1974
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:29,710
but I am holding it in until now.

1975
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,540
- I am holding it in until now.
- Suk Jin.

1976
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,300
You are mistaken
if you think you are holding it in.

1977
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,800
Your pants are pretty wet.

1978
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,170
It doesn't show...

1979
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,880
- because I rolled around.
- Your pants are pretty wet.

1980
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,210
It doesn't show
because I rolled around.

1981
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,420
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1982
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,350
- I see why you worked hard.
- Yes.

1983
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:44,290
I see why you were determined
to survive until the end.

1984
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:47,320
It's no wonder
things got more watery.

1985
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,090
- I tried my best to hide it.
- I see.

1986
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:51,630
Does anyone want to trade land
with Haeundae-gu?

1987
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:52,820
- Haeundae-gu?
- Yes.

1988
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,760
- Do you want to trade?
- Which land do you offer?

1989
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:56,520
Do you have land in mind?

1990
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,230
Do you want to trade Haeundae-gu
with Nam-gu?

1991
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,560
Where is Nam-gu?
Is it right next to Haeundae-gu?

1992
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,430
- It's right next to Haeundae-gu.
- Nam-gu, Daegu?

1993
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,230
You should give me some more money.

1994
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:04,930
It's good land.

1995
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,770
Nam-gu is good land too.

1996
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:08,810
- It doesn't bring in much money,
- Okay.

1997
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,510
- but it's good land.
- Same here.

1998
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:12,050
Give me 20 dollars.

1999
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:15,180
I need money.
I only have 20 dollars right now.

2000
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:17,720
If the price goes down,
I won't sit still.

2001
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,290
The price won't go down.

2002
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,350
- You have to promise me that.
- I promise you that.

2003
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,720
- You have to promise me that.
- I don't have such lands.

2004
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,630
- Are the numbers in red?
- They are in red.

2005
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:25,630
Really?

2006
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:26,820
Did the price fall for Nam-gu?

2007
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,500
No. I made profits.

2008
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,970
For goodness' sake.

2009
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:33,340
Okay. Let's make the exchange.

2010
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,210
I trust you.

2011
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,770
Trust me. So it's...

2012
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:38,600
- in Daegu.
- Nam-gu.

2013
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,600
(They exchange Nam-gu, Daegu
and Haeundae-gu, Busan.)

2014
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,940
Here. It's Haeundae-gu.

2015
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,310
(Haeundae-gu, Busan:
300 dollars down at 2 p.m.)

2016
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,010
I made 100 dollars.

2017
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:46,510
(300 dollars down at 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.)

2018
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,920
(Nam-gu, Daegu: 400 dollars down
at 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.)

2019
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:50,810
For goodness' sake.

2020
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:52,310
(400 dollars down?)

2021
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,350
That little grasshopper.

2022
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,820
I made 100 dollars.

2023
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:59,520
(Suk Jin got tricked.)

2024
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,600
A hundred dollars.

2025
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,320
How could you be so evil?

2026
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,470
(Jae Suk easily got rid
of a problematic land.)

2027
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,360
I will go and purchase land.

2028
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:08,510
Oh, there is a way
to get rid of bad factors.

2029
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:09,860
- Where?
- Thank goodness.

2030
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,900
- What?
- There is a way to get rid of it.

2031
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,810
Can you get rid of bad factors?
I didn't know that.

2032
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,100
(Hula dance to get rid of
bad factors.)

2033
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,880
It's just minus 300 dollars.

2034
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:20,680
- Let's cancel the trade.
- No way.

2035
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,920
I didn't know it was possible
to get rid of bad factors.

2036
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,510
It was right there.

2037
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:26,090
- That's too much.
- The numbers are in the negative.

2038
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,930
You lied too.

2039
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:31,350
Your lie is much greater.
You reaped the benefits.

2040
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:33,360
The price will begin to fall at 2 p.m.

2041
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,060
At 2 p.m.? Now?

2042
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:36,260
(The price will begin to fall now.)

2043
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,670
I can't believe him.

2044
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,670
I will go and purchase land.

2045
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,140
It's the best.

2046
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:45,230
(Earlier)

2047
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:52,510
(Jong Kook won the lottery.)

2048
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:54,010
(He visits the intermediary office
with cash.)

2049
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:55,790
All right.

2050
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,510
- Why didn't anyone buy Guro-gu?
- What? I didn't know.

2051
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,930
I will go and look.

2052
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:08,220
(Many lands are still unoccupied.)

2053
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,560
(Glancing over)

2054
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:15,860
Jung-gu, Ulsan. Buk-gu, Ulsan.

2055
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,310
Buk-gu, Ulsan?

2056
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:20,100
Buk-gu, Ulsan. Yes.

2057
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,140
(Jong Kook chooses Buk-gu, Ulsan.)

2058
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,400
Buk-gu, Ulsan.

2059
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,680
(Jong Kook chooses Buk-gu, Ulsan.)

2060
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:27,180
(Buk-gu, Ulsan: 500 dollars up
at 2 p.m and 3 p.m.)

2061
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:28,180
(500 dollars up)

2062
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,510
My goodness.

2063
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:33,350
(He purchased a jackpot land
by chance.)

2064
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,720
This is...

2065
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,190
(Buk-gu, Ulsan
shows the highest price.)

2066
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:41,190
Hold on.

2067
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,220
Hold on. How much do I have?

2068
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,170
Should I buy something else?

2069
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,210
Dong-gu, Daejeon, please.

2070
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:50,100
(He purchases Dong-gu, Daejeon.)

2071
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,310
(How is the price
for Dong-gu, Daejeon?)

2072
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:53,400
- All right.
- Whatever.

2073
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,400
(How is the price
for Dong-gu, Daejeon?)

2074
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:59,770
(Dong-gu, Daejeon: 100 dollars down
at 2 p.m., 700 dollars up at 3 p.m.)

2075
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:03,050
(700 dollars up?)

2076
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:07,890
(He discovered
another jackpot land.)

2077
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:11,150
This is my decisive move.

2078
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,800
Guro-gu, please.

2079
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,220
- Guro-gu, Seoul?
- Yes.

2080
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,720
Let's take a look.

2081
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,000
(Guro-gu, Seoul: 50 dollars down
at 2 p.m., 200 dollars up at 3 p.m.)

2082
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,600
All right.

2083
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,710
If I keep it until then,
I will get the original cost.

2084
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:25,340
- Jong Kook, you have a call.
- Yes?

2085
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,600
Is that so?

2086
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,140
I am done.

2087
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:31,770
Stop littering on my land.

2088
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:34,720
I didn't litter. That's a landfill.

2089
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,290
- It has always been that way.
- It looks like...

2090
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,810
I won't be able to take
1st place or 2nd place.

2091
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,890
I see my lands...

2092
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,630
as I walk down now.

2093
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:44,630
Where?

2094
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:45,690
(Will Jong Kook be able
to come from behind?)

2095
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:49,320
I can move a lot more now.

2096
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,640
Who is it?

2097
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,760
Hello. Jae Suk speaking.

2098
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:56,970
Okay.

2099
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:00,710
- It must be about Haeundae-gu.
- What's that?

2100
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:01,970
(He begins the hula dance.)

2101
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:04,720
Haeundae-gu
is definitely a cheerful place.

2102
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,680
(He is getting rid of
the bad factors of Haeundae-gu.)

2103
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,260
(He is in a good mood.)

2104
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,510
Doing that gets rid of
the bad factors.

2105
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:13,630
(Suk Jin didn't know that.)

2106
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,220
Once I do this,
the numbers won't be in the negative

2107
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:21,820
With the land I gave him,
Suk Jin will lose 300 dollars

2108
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:23,860
He is so annoying.

2109
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,360
Such is life

2110
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,760
Suk Jin, don't criticize me

2111
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,310
We lied to each other

2112
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:34,510
So we can't say
one was better than the other

2113
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,440
Jae Suk stepped on Jungnang-gu
multiple times while dancing.

2114
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:39,720
All right. Pay up.

2115
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,090
- Pay up.
- He stepped on it five times.

2116
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:43,180
He stepped on Jungnang-gu
repeatedly.

2117
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,180
- Who did that?
- You did.

2118
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,510
You stepped on Jungnang-gu
as you danced.

2119
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,820
- I was carrying out the mission.
- I saw it too.

2120
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,320
It's still prohibited.

2121
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,190
- That's right.
- Who owns Jungnang-gu?

2122
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,760
- Me.
- Take ten dollars.

2123
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:56,520
- Hey.
- For goodness' sake.

2124
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,730
- The elders are talking.
- That's dirty.

2125
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:01,100
- Why is your butt so wet?
- Stop it.

2126
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,880
Ji Hyo, let me cross your land
for ten dollars.

2127
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,040
Okay.

2128
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,400
Get it from Se Chan.

2129
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,600
Where are you going?

2130
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,710
I am going to use the restroom.

2131
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:10,970
You can't go from there.

2132
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,420
Can you go from there?

2133
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:14,090
I am going to find a way.

2134
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,250
(Hammering)

2135
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:17,720
What are you doing?

2136
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,390
I am going to step on these nails.

2137
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,060
It won't work.

2138
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,960
Suk Jin, why are you being
so pessimistic?

2139
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,000
(He begins to nail the wall.)

2140
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,430
(Screaming)

2141
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,670
For goodness' sake.

2142
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,260
He has a condition.
He wants to go to a hospital.

2143
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,880
If he isn't careful,

2144
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,770
- he will skin his butt.
- He wants to go to a hospital.

2145
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:41,850
- His body must be itching.
- Then Jong Kook's brother...

2146
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,810
- will perform surgery.
- Just pay the toll.

2147
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,550
Just pay the toll.

2148
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:49,310
I can't use 20 dollars
to go to the restroom.

2149
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:50,310
(He is frugal
despite having many lands.)

2150
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:51,810
(He begins to break the wall.)

2151
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:52,810
That works.

2152
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:53,820
(He begins to break the wall.)

2153
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:55,320
That's right. Try rock climbing.

2154
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:58,650
Nail the wall.
Yes. Do it like Um Hong Gil.

2155
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:02,100
Isn't it the first time
someone broke the wall on the show?

2156
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:05,670
If he makes a path,
I will go out of business.

2157
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:06,970
That's right. You will be dirt poor.

2158
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:12,600
(He succeeds to climb up.)

2159
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,710
- He is happy.
- I can't help but think,

2160
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:18,750
"What am I doing?"

2161
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:22,590
Hey, I hope you succeed.

2162
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:25,810
He is basically paving a highway.
I can't let him do that.

2163
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:27,930
I hope he falls.

2164
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,020
- I hope he falls.
- Jae Suk is strong.

2165
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:31,220
I just need one more.

2166
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:32,220
(I just need one more.)

2167
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,470
(Will he succeed in rock climbing?)

2168
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:36,320
- I hope he falls.
- It will be funny.

2169
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:38,430
- I hope he falls.
- It will be funny.

2170
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:40,190
Fall.

2171
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:42,510
What is he doing?

2172
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,140
- Did he succeed?
- What is he doing?

2173
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,770
(He succeeded in rock climbing.)

2174
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:50,420
Did he succeed?

2175
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,940
- Yes.
- Did he succeed?

2176
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,220
- He succeeded.
- Did he succeed?

2177
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,420
(He became the first person
to climb the set.)

2178
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:55,550
Is he still hanging?

2179
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,560
He succeeded.

2180
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,980
- So Min.
- He is incredible.

2181
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,930
- How will he return?
- You have to return.

2182
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:02,590
How will you return?

2183
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:04,020
You have to return.

2184
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:06,560
So Min.

2185
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:08,690
Let me use the restroom first.

2186
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:10,430
(He will think afterward.)

2187
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:13,900
Hold on.

2188
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:19,100
(So Min brings a sheet.)

2189
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,610
(She fills up the holes.)

2190
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:28,180
(The landowner refuses
to stand there and do nothing.)

2191
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,310
I feel so refreshed.

2192
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,010
What are you doing?

2193
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,430
- So Min.
- Yes?

2194
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:36,820
Bye.

2195
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,800
(So Min heads
to the intermediary office.)

2196
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,860
She is as ridiculous as I am.

2197
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,000
Why did she have to put a sheet
over the holes?

2198
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,510
The unpurchased lands...
Is that Haha's land in Busan?

2199
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,040
I want to purchase Seodaemun-gu.

2200
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,880
- Seodaemun-gu.
- Yes.

2201
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,100
- Gwangjin-gu, Seoul.
- So Min.

2202
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,180
- So Min.
- Yes?

2203
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,880
Hurry up and drop Jae Suk.

2204
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,880
Hey.

2205
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,310
Do it.

2206
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:03,610
- Make him step on your land.
- Hey.

2207
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:04,920
You can't do that.

2208
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,920
I was purchasing lands.

2209
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,960
- Push him. Now is your chance.
- Now is your chance.

2210
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,520
Hey.

2211
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,930
(He got caught right away.)

2212
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:17,000
(The tragic climber who messed
with the wrong landowner)

2213
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,300
- Hey.
- He will fall. Hang in there.

2214
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:22,310
Gosh.

2215
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:24,770
Counting 20 dollars,
30 dollars, 40 dollars...

2216
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:26,430
- It's 40 dollars.
- Come on.

2217
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,100
Three steps.

2218
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,510
- Ten dollars.
- You took three steps.

2219
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,180
- Three steps.
- So Min, take ten dollars.

2220
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,880
- Three steps.
- It's 30 dollars.

2221
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,750
Pay 20 dollars
since you took 3 steps.

2222
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:38,260
It would have been easier
to pay ten dollars each way.

2223
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:42,020
You sweated for no reason.

2224
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,430
My goodness.

2225
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,430
Dongnae-gu, Busan.

2226
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,970
- Dongnae-gu?
- Yes.

2227
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:49,430
Buk-gu, Gwangju.

2228
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:50,690
I will buy all three lands
in Daejeon.

2229
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:52,760
I lost so much money.

2230
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,040
Bo Pil, before you leave,

2231
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,710
please make sure I don't look
overly greedy in this episode.

2232
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:02,680
Suk Jin is
the epitome of greed today.

2233
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,810
I think I look a bit greedy.

2234
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,220
(It's time for the third payout.)

2235
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,180
The totals are out.

2236
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:11,560
(Jae Suk, Se Chan, Jong Kook,)

2237
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,720
(Haha, Ji Hyo, So Min, Suk Jin)

2238
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,350
- Se Chan has many good lands.
- The totals are out.

2239
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:17,430
Me? Not really.

2240
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:18,800
Jong Kook?

2241
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:21,190
Jae Suk is 1st place.
He made 650 dollars.

2242
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:22,800
He has a lot of land.

2243
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,470
It's important to buy a lot of land.
I told you.

2244
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:28,400
That's right.
Jae Suk has a lot of land.

2245
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,810
Jong Kook has the best lands.

2246
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:33,880
Jong Kook must have
a very profitable property.

2247
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,600
I'll wait for the next round.

2248
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,850
(He has two profitable areas.)

2249
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:40,270
I'll wait for the next round.

2250
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:42,920
- It will increase by 500 dollars.
- I'll make more money next time.

2251
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:44,810
Jong Kook's property?

2252
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:49,090
If I get lucky,
I might place second.

2253
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:51,060
(If he keeps his land,
he can turn the game around.)

2254
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:53,930
Jong Kook has two areas
that will increase by 500 dollars.

2255
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,560
- Those two areas.
- It's free, right?

2256
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,020
- It'll go up by 500 dollars.
- I can step on...

2257
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:58,230
- my own land.
- Does he have three areas?

2258
01:18:58,430 --> 01:18:59,930
The maximum amount is 500 dollars.
Does anyone have such areas?

2259
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:01,100
- Jong Kook does.
- Jong Kook does.

2260
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,710
- Jong Kook does?
- Jong Kook.

2261
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,930
- It must be in Ulsan.
- I don't know which areas he has.

2262
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:07,400
- You know the changes of Gwangju.
- Yes, I know.

2263
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:11,110
The person who gets
Jong Kook's land.

2264
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,570
I think I'll lose it
in the next round.

2265
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:15,110
We have to get Jong Kook's land.

2266
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:16,940
We have to find Jae Suk's land too.

2267
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,060
(He must keep his land that will
make 700 dollars of profit.)

2268
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,310
The member who wins this round
can turn the game around.

2269
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:21,980
You have to roll it.

2270
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,460
(As a result of a simple game
to make the final purchase...)

2271
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,650
He threw it.

2272
01:19:25,150 --> 01:19:26,720
This is your final purchase.

2273
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,520
(Suk Jin who won the mission will
make a purchase first.)

2274
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,670
Well...

2275
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:32,890
There's no property
without an owner.

2276
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:35,540
Can I get information
on Buk-gu, Ulsan?

2277
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,600
(Suk Jin gets information
on Jong Kook's land as expected.)

2278
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,900
- Information on Buk-gu, Ulsan?
- Yes, please.

2279
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:44,420
(But Buk-gu, Ulsan, is...)

2280
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:48,250
(the property that will make
500 dollars of profit.)

2281
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,680
(Awesome!)

2282
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,850
I'll buy Buk-gu, Ulsan.

2283
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,220
It's 150 dollars.

2284
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,630
(Suk Jin who found the land at once
purchases it right away.)

2285
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:55,890
My gosh. I hit the jackpot.

2286
01:19:57,690 --> 01:19:59,800
(Ripping off)

2287
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:02,390
My gosh.
He bought my land right away.

2288
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:03,860
(So Jong Kook lost
one of the profitable areas.)

2289
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,640
Where else is yours?

2290
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:07,360
Here.

2291
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,810
(Suk Jin is asking about Jae Suk's land,
not about Jong Kook's.)

2292
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:11,900
(The members didn't figure out about
the better property Jong Kook has.)

2293
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,270
Is Gwangsan-gu, Gwangju, yours too?

2294
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:14,350
(The members didn't figure out about
the better property Jong Kook has.)

2295
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:15,440
Then...

2296
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:16,680
What else does Jae Suk have?

2297
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:18,420
Jae Suk's land.

2298
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:19,510
The ones with "Yoo" on them.

2299
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:21,680
Nam-gu, Ulsan.

2300
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:24,310
- Nam-gu, Ulsan, please.
- Information on Nam-gu, Ulsan?

2301
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:26,350
- Nam-gu, Ulsan.
- Are you done?

2302
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:29,020
(Nam-gu, Ulsan, will make
400 dollars of profit.)

2303
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:30,820
- I'll buy it.
- Okay.

2304
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:32,300
Yes. I'll buy all the good ones.

2305
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,260
It's 150 dollars? Here you go.

2306
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,100
Look at him from behind.

2307
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,800
Look at him from behind.

2308
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,970
He's being greedy.

2309
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,100
He's being greedy
unlike his usual tendency.

2310
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,510
Can I get information
on Gwangsan-gu, Gwangju?

2311
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,380
- Gwangsan-gu, Gwangju?
- Yes.

2312
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,230
(Gwangsan-gu, Gwangju:
100 dollars up at 3 p.m.)

2313
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:48,310
I'll buy it.

2314
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,470
(I'll buy it.)

2315
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:50,940
Okay. I'll buy it.

2316
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,440
(The value of Seongbuk-gu, Seoul,
will increase by 100 dollars.)

2317
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:53,610
Okay.

2318
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:55,750
(Happy)

2319
01:20:56,790 --> 01:21:00,090
(So the number of purple areas
decreases gradually.)

2320
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,790
- He bought many of Jae Suk's.
- Exactly.

2321
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:05,300
It's understandable because Jae Suk
had many profitable areas.

2322
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,000
- Right.
- He made 600 dollars.

2323
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:09,520
I can't buy the areas back.

2324
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,560
- Right.
- Oh, that's right.

2325
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,640
Can I get information on Jongno-gu?

2326
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,760
Let's plant apple trees in Jongno

2327
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:17,680
It's not so profitable,
but I'll buy it since I can make a profit.

2328
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:19,070
Here you go.

2329
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,850
I'll give you Dong-gu, Gwangju,
for 50 dollars.

2330
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,610
- Thirty dollars.
- I'm not interested.

2331
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,140
- He's being reckless.
- I'll give it to you for free.

2332
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,480
(I'll give it to you for free.)

2333
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:29,680
If you want to win the race,

2334
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:33,460
buy Gangdong-gu, Seoul,
and Dong-gu, Gwangju.

2335
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,760
The value of Gangdong-gu will
decrease by 200 dollars.

2336
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,560
Why that little...

2337
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,860
The value of Gangdong-gu will decrease
by 200 dollars.

2338
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:44,670
These two areas are
the master keys to winning.

2339
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:47,000
They're going to drop by
200 and 300 dollars.

2340
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:48,510
That little...

2341
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:49,900
(Upset)

2342
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,600
(Jong Kook who lost
1 of his 2 profitable areas...)

2343
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,770
I'm doomed.

2344
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,380
Se Chan!

2345
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,270
- It's ten dollars, right?
- Yes.

2346
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:00,180
(He'll be ranked high
if he buys profitable land.)

2347
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,480
Okay. Let's go.

2348
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,680
- Can I check out Geumcheon-gu? Yes.
- Geumcheon-gu?

2349
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:07,590
(He purchases information
on Jae Suk's land.)

2350
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:09,960
Haha, you look great.

2351
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,320
(But it won't make a big profit.)

2352
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,690
- This is the final round.
- Then...

2353
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:15,970
It'd be pointless to buy land
to make 50 dollars, right?

2354
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,600
- It should be at least 200 dollars.
- Yes! I hit the jackpot!

2355
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:23,430
- Only then I'll make enough profit.
- That's mine!

2356
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,600
- I won't buy it.
- Give me that.

2357
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,900
- I'll just leave.
- Are you done?

2358
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,440
Yes.

2359
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:32,770
Gosh. I lost too many of my areas.

2360
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,250
(Next up is Jae Suk who lost
a lot of profitable areas.)

2361
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:36,290
Can I get information on this area?

2362
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,980
- Yangcheon-gu. I mean, Jungnang-gu.
- Okay.

2363
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:41,520
And Seo-gu, Busan.

2364
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:42,960
Gwangjin-gu as well, please.

2365
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,820
(Then he bought all of the areas.)

2366
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,930
Yes, I'll buy all three of them.

2367
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,520
Would you like to buy
Jungnang-gu too?

2368
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,640
Here's 450 dollars.

2369
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:54,360
What should we do?

2370
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,100
- Gosh. Twerking again?
- Not again.

2371
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,880
- This must be the last time.
- I think it'll be different. Hello?

2372
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,750
- Yes. Where? Got it.
- I hate the sight of it.

2373
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:06,550
Because you bought new land?

2374
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,940
- Did you buy another area?
- Gosh.

2375
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,220
(He starts twerking again.)

2376
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:11,680
- I was told to do this.
- I'm sick of it.

2377
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,060
- He smells like fart.
- Hey!

2378
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:15,480
- Gosh.
- I'm sick of seeing his butt.

2379
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,460
- Gosh.
- Seriously.

2380
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:19,020
- What was that?
- I had no choice.

2381
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,890
I had to do that in order to
avoid losing money. I'm sorry.

2382
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,670
- Why did you show it to my face?
- Let's go!

2383
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,600
Since this is the final round,
we'll change the rule for you.

2384
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,140
The top 3 will survive,
and 2 of the bottom 4 will get a penalty.

2385
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,810
- What?
- The top three will survive.

2386
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:33,010
You see...

2387
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:35,070
- I'd be upset if I place 3rd...
- I should be in the top 3.

2388
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:36,810
- and get a penalty.
- That'd be unfair.

2389
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:38,420
- I'd be upset.
- I'd be really upset too.

2390
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,890
How do we decide the top two
at the end of the game?

2391
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,390
Based on the money we have?

2392
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:44,810
On top of the cash you have,
we'll tally the value of your land.

2393
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,350
- A hundred dollars per area?
- Yes.

2394
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:47,960
Let's check the result.

2395
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:49,180
Everyone.

2396
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,150
I'll announce the result.

2397
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:52,150
(The final value of the investors'
land has been tallied.)

2398
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,260
The first place is...

2399
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,200
The first place is...

2400
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:03,200
Jae Suk with
a total of 3,215 dollars.

2401
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,700
(Jae Suk placed 1st
with 3,215 dollars.)

2402
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,540
- Jae Suk won.
- He's rich with a lot of land.

2403
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,340
And the 2nd and 3rd places
were neck and neck.

2404
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:12,450
The 2nd and 3rd places?

2405
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:13,910
But the member
who was in third place...

2406
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,490
- dropped in the rankings.
- Really?

2407
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:17,710
(The person in third place
dropped in the rankings.)

2408
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:20,990
(The lucky person
who placed second safely is...)

2409
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:25,500
With 2,550 dollars,
Jong Kook placed 2nd.

2410
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,030
(Jong Kook placed second.)

2411
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:28,830
- I pulled it off.
- That was unexpected.

2412
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,900
I focused solely on basic needs.

2413
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:34,070
(Jong Kook placed 2nd with 3 areas
and a total of 2,550 dollars.)

2414
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:35,370
(The young man from Busan
turned his life around.)

2415
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:37,830
- That's amazing.
- My, that's incredible.

2416
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:41,870
The member
who could have gotten a penalty,

2417
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:44,250
- but placed third and survived...
- Could it be me?

2418
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:45,540
It must be Suk Jin.

2419
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,840
I think I'm in third place
based on the money I have.

2420
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,360
- Could it be So Min?
- I don't think it's me.

2421
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,050
- I think it's Seok Sam.
- Oh, is it Suk Jin?

2422
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,230
(The last person to be exempt from
the penalty is...)

2423
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:53,380
It is...

2424
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:56,090
Se Chan with 2,010 dollars.

2425
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,500
- See?
- The ten dollars I got saved me.

2426
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,200
(Se Chan placed 3rd with 12 areas
and a total of 2,010 dollars.)

2427
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,500
- He gave me some money.
- Right.

2428
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,460
And picked up bills from the floor.

2429
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:04,590
- I'm dizzy.
- I...

2430
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:05,760
I didn't expect Se Chan
to be in third place.

2431
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:07,660
- Exactly.
- I'll go on.

2432
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:10,170
So Min placed 4th,
and Ji Hyo placed 5th.

2433
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,700
Suk Jin placed 6th,
and Haha placed 7th.

2434
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:13,800
- Suk Jin...
- Suk Jin...

2435
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,950
(The greedy Suk Jin placed sixth?)

2436
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:17,040
- Suk Jin...
- Suk Jin...

2437
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,320
- But why did Suk Jin...
- Today...

2438
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,750
- He made a lot of effort.
- For the effort he made...

2439
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:21,510
- Me?
- He's ranked too low.

2440
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,690
- I told you so.
- I'm ranked that low?

2441
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:25,830
For the effort he made...

2442
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:28,120
Haha, you were in third place,
but you suffered great losses...

2443
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,450
in the final round.

2444
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:31,330
- I told you not to buy the land.
- Why is Suk Jin ranked so low?

2445
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,090
What went wrong, Suk Jin?

2446
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:36,240
I mean,
there are some people like me.

2447
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,760
People are different.

2448
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,870
You're right.

2449
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:42,370
Just as I planned...

2450
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:45,200
- "Just as I planned?"
- You know...

2451
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,950
I wanted to portray
that kind of person.

2452
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:49,450
- A greedy man?
- Yes.

2453
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:52,010
Anyway, today,

2454
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:53,690
two of the bottom four will
get a penalty.

2455
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:55,510
- Okay.
- Let's go!

2456
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:56,710
- Let's go. Let's get it over with.
- This is the finale.

2457
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:58,250
- This is the real finale.
- All right!

2458
01:25:58,250 --> 01:25:59,950
- What's the penalty?
- I'll explain to you.

2459
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,750
It will wash your bad investments
cleanly.

2460
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,590
- It's Random Soda Fountain.
- Oh, dear.

2461
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:09,070
(Random Soda Fountain)

2462
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:10,500
- Oh, gosh. It'll be sticky.
- Oh, dear.

2463
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,130
There will be boxes
numbered from 1 to 4.

2464
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,800
You can only see
the top of the bottles.

2465
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,670
While looking at it,
you will drop gums...

2466
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:21,110
that make soda blow up
at the same time.

2467
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:23,370
Two of them will blow up...

2468
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:24,870
- while the others won't.
- Right.

2469
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:26,710
- You mean, with Mentos?
- Right. I get it.

2470
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:27,990
Number two.

2471
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:29,160
- I'll choose any number.
- Stand in front of your bottle.

2472
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,990
- Let's go!
- Now, bite the Mentos.

2473
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:34,160
(They're standing in front of
the bottles nervously.)

2474
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,750
Drop them into the bottle
at the same time.

2475
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:39,660
Do not lift your head up
after dropping them.

2476
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:41,070
- Put your nose in it.
- Will it come up high?

2477
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:42,830
- Ready. Get set.
- Lower.

2478
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,290
(Who will be the unlucky two members
to get hit by the cola fountain?)

2479
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:46,200
- Ready. Get set.
- Lower.

2480
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,630
- This is Bo Pil's last penalty.
- Go.

2481
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:49,580
(They all drop the bomb
at the same time.)

2482
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,130
Put your face close to the bottle.

2483
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:56,170
(So Min chose the cola fountain.)

2484
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:57,340
Look at her.

2485
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:01,880
(The soda shower cleans
your pores too.)

2486
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:05,080
- Is it me?
- Suk Jin and Ji Hyo survived.

2487
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,530
(Haha and So Min got the penalty.
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo survived.)

2488
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:07,620
So Min, are you all right?

2489
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:08,700
Suk Jin...

2490
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:09,830
Hey, don't worry about others.

2491
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:11,920
- It's important that we survived.
- It wasn't as intense as I thought.

2492
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,500
- Good job, everyone.
- Thank you, Bo Pil.

2493
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,870
- Bo Pil, thank you for everything.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2494
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,160
(So the 12th summer of Running Man
is passing by.)

2495
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,410
