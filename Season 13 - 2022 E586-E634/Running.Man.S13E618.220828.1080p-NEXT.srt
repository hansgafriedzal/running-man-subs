1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,960
- Hello.
- Hey.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,800
This is Hyung In's first day,
so I'll try hard today.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,270
Hyung In, why am I a slave
from the beginning?

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,530
We have three birthday people
in August.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,680
(The table is loaded with a feast
for the members' birthdays.)

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,870
- Should I scoop rice?
- Here?

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,640
- Should we spoon-feed them?
- Yes.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,440
- Feed them?
- Spoon-feed them?

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,320
- It's not like...
- My gosh.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,680
In the Joseon Dynasty...

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,140
- It's soup. It looks delicious.
- Even in the Joseon Dynasty,

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,960
- they ate things by themselves.
- I know.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,120
This is kimchi.

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,280
- Look at So Bal.
- So Bal.

15
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,430
I can tell you rarely do this.

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,590
- No, this is hard.
- This is really cool.

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,160
- Scrape it.
- You should scrape the bottom.

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,290
It must be delicious.

19
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,820
- It does look delicious.
- By the way,

20
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,760
slaves don't get to eat a lot.

21
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,430
Once the aristocrats get here,

22
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll put on a show with the kimchi.

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,330
(Yoom)

24
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,380
Kimchi tastes good
when it's cut by hand.

25
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,970
- Se Chan, you should do this.
- It's so tasty.

26
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,680
Suk Jin, you can't eat it.
It's for the aristocrats.

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,140
They don't know
how many pieces we had.

28
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,250
I'll tell them.

29
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,110
Jong Kook, we should roll him
in a straw mat and beat him up.

30
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,210
I know.

31
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,780
- No, we need two.
- Se Chan.

32
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,360
- Is it good?
- Yes. No one will know. Eat.

33
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,260
You know what?
The aristocrats should taste...

34
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,260
the kimchi shredded by Slave Yang.

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,590
I'll do that for them later.

36
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,540
- Here.
- I'll shred it for them.

37
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,510
- All right.
- No one will know.

38
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,310
- Just eat.
- They can't tell?

39
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,070
- Then I should eat.
- They wouldn't know.

40
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,610
Who cooked this?

41
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,650
- Right.
- Gosh, this is so good.

42
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,710
The jeon is delicious.

43
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,670
The aristocrats are here.

44
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,840
- They're here.
- Gosh.

45
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,250
- You're here.
- Hello.

46
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,010
- Hello.
- Hello.

47
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,180
- You're here.
- How are you?

48
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,760
You all work hard.

49
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,390
Why are you wearing sunglasses
in a historical play?

50
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,120
- Go away, Seok Sam.
- Who are you?

51
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,400
- I'm just...
- Don't be silly and go away.

52
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,730
I'm serving the rice.

53
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,090
- Seok Sam, stop it and go away.
- This is...

54
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,340
- I mean...
- I'm telling you again.

55
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,140
The Joseon Dynasty...

56
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,540
had a caste system.

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,670
- Okay.
- Hey!

58
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,010
How dare you open the lid?

59
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,510
Go away.

60
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,170
- All right.
- We have gifts for the aristocrats.

61
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,250
- Is it money?
- It's coins.

62
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,890
You can give the coins
to slaves who work hard...

63
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,760
or make them fight for the coins.
You can use them as you please.

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,730
Will the aristocrats
make us fight? My goodness.

65
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,320
But the coins will be important
in today's race.

66
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,730
You should remember that
when you distribute the coins.

67
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,440
All right. Today is Hyung In's
first day as the Team Producer.

68
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,300
- Congratulations.
- So I texted...

69
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,510
- Hyung In earlier.
- What did you tell her?

70
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,200
I said I would make her...

71
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
feel anxious during her first shoot.

72
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,040
- Why would you do that?
- I'll mess things up.

73
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,110
Why would you do that, sir?

74
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,510
- Because...
- He will mess things up.

75
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,320
I said this on purpose. "Hyung In,
for our first shoot,"

76
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,080
"I'll have things my own way
without listening to you."

77
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,160
How dare you...

78
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,230
How dare you stand
between the aristocrats?

79
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,420
- She's right about that.
- You're a slave.

80
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,100
- Go away.
- I got hit in the back of my head.

81
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,360
- Go away.
- Get away from me.

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,890
- Come over here.
- Come here.

83
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,890
- Go.
- You...

84
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,200
Aren't you supposed to stand here?

85
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,640
- We have a caste system now.
- It's a caste system.

86
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,410
- Do you not know the caste system?
- The caste system!

87
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,300
- She even hit him.
- You just bought your class.

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,380
- What did you say?
- You bought it with money.

89
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,380
Bought it with money?

90
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,140
Okay. I'll work hard and buy one.

91
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,570
So I told Hyung In...

92
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,610
- that I would be reckless.
- Reckless?

93
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,920
"The shoot will go well
only when you feel comfortable."

94
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,720
- This is what she said.
- Really?

95
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,290
So I got really upset.

96
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,890
You're the one who's being anxious.

97
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,630
- He's the one who's suffering.
- I found it really upsetting.

98
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,990
He hates responses like that.

99
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,130
I hate it so much.

100
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,990
- My gosh.
- When she's being calm.

101
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,630
- I know.
- He wants her to be mad.

102
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,260
It's no fun to tease her.

103
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,230
Please enjoy the birthday party now.

104
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,640
- Let's enjoy the feast.
- Please enjoy the food.

105
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,800
- All right. Don't come up.
- First, eat your food.

106
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,610
- We have many delicious dishes.
- Go away.

107
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,200
- Don't come up.
- Please go ahead.

108
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,380
Hello, sir.

109
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,110
- I heard you got enteritis.
- We have many dishes here.

110
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,010
The sun is setting.

111
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,450
Hey, go away.

112
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,820
- You, go away.
- Mr. Haha,

113
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,190
- please take off your sunglasses.
- Jong Kook.

114
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,190
Drag him down.

115
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,730
- I want to eat.
- Bring him.

116
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,920
Drag him down.

117
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,320
- Hey, wait.
- Ssaebssaeb.

118
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,820
- Can't you pick up on the cues?
- Lift his legs.

119
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,520
- Where are your shoes?
- Bring him.

120
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,570
Get up.

121
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,730
Hey, get up.

122
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,940
(Slave Jeon suddenly
makes a deep bow.)

123
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,230
- Where are my shoes?
- Your shoes.

124
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,700
- Let's sit then.
- Get up.

125
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,910
How many bows are you making?

126
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
I'm performing an ancestral rite.

127
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,880
All right then.

128
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,850
- The food looks great.
- Kimchi.

129
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,670
(It's time to taste the dishes made
with the slaves' sweat and blood.)

130
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,950
It's really good.

131
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,090
Gosh, I haven't
tried this in a while.

132
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,980
The airplane is taking off.

133
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,030
Here it comes.

134
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,600
It's an airplane.

135
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,400
(It's an airplane of rice cake.)

136
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,550
Is there an airplane?

137
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,030
- Open up.
- Wright brothers weren't born yet.

138
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,040
(Sticking out his tongue)

139
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,060
- What are you doing now?
- By the way,

140
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,410
is he So Min's son?

141
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,110
- There's nothing good for you.
- Why don't we...

142
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,740
I'll give you just one dish.

143
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,910
- Jong Kook.
- Yes.

144
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,220
- Come and massage my shoulders.
- That sounds great.

145
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,350
- This is my spot.
- Gosh. I get it.

146
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,680
- Go over there.
- Wait.

147
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,310
I'm serving her now.
Why do you meddle in?

148
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,420
(Slave Ji wants to join them.)

149
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,550
You might choke.

150
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,830
You look like a character
from an animation movie.

151
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,160
I don't want you
to choke on the food.

152
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,900
- Jong Kook.
- Yes.

153
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,400
- Come and massage my shoulders.
- That sounds great.

154
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,930
(Slave Kim is confident
in using his strength.)

155
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,410
- That's what I'm good at.
- All right.

156
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,840
You know it well.

157
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,430
I'm serving her now.

158
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,280
This feels good. A little lower.

159
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,670
- A little lower?
- Yes.

160
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,670
(He presses the shoulder blades hard
to get some coins.)

161
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,610
- Here?
- It's coming out.

162
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,980
- Here?
- It's right there.

163
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,480
- This is it.
- That's it.

164
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,610
So this is it.

165
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,810
- Jong Kook, here.
- Oh, dear.

166
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,520
- Thank you so much, sir.
- I couldn't help it.

167
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,660
What are you doing? Wait.

168
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,120
(Slave Ji starts
to massage him abruptly.)

169
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,790
Hey.

170
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,560
- Jong Kook.
- Yes.

171
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,400
- Drag him out.
- Drag him out?

172
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,040
The thing is, Seok Sam is...

173
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,130
very enthusiastic,
but he doesn't know what to do.

174
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,800
Gosh, I'm so upset.

175
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,130
You want this?

176
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,340
- Seok Sam.
- Yes.

177
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,210
Since it is our birthday,
I want you to go over there...

178
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,580
and dance for us.

179
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,610
Yes, sir.

180
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,680
Seok Sam, I just want you
to try your best.

181
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,940
I like Seok Sam.

182
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,660
Look at me

183
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:12,970
Look at me

184
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,270
(Embarrassed)

185
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,970
What is he doing?

186
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,060
As if I'm a flower
blooming in winter

187
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,840
- Hey. Seok Sam.
- Please look at me

188
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,370
- Here comes Arari
- Not like that.

189
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,210
The thing you did...

190
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,520
when you were in the military.
Dancing Bear.

191
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,040
What? Is that a thing?

192
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,220
- What's that?
- Really?

193
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,540
- Back then...
- You should do that.

194
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,050
That's what his superior called him.

195
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,180
"Hey, Dancing Bear."

196
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,250
"Yes, sir. Corporal Dancing Bear."

197
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,590
A bear?

198
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,730
(Corporal Dancing Bear)

199
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,790
A bear?

200
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,290
Dancing Bear.

201
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,400
- What's that?
- This is what I did.

202
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,100
Anywhere, anytime.
Once his superior called him...

203
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,490
"Hey, Dancing Bear."

204
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,430
"Yes, sir. Corporal Dancing Bear."

205
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,930
(He starts dancing right away.)

206
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,610
- That's real.
- I did the dancing.

207
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,000
- That's nice.
- I like that.

208
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,610
- I do like that.
- It looks nice.

209
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,670
I love it.

210
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,280
- So...
- My gosh. Thank you so much.

211
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,110
- I want to use my strength.
- Thank you, sir.

212
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,720
- Jong Kook is...
- Thank you, sir.

213
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,660
- All right then.
- You should sit and eat now.

214
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,290
- Have a seat and eat.
- Shall we?

215
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,860
We should eat when we're told so.

216
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,090
- Seok Sam.
- There's no bowl.

217
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,620
Come and sing for us.

218
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,290
Gosh, it's hot.

219
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,360
Gosh, it's hot.

220
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,560
(Gosh, it's hot.)

221
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,730
It's really hot.

222
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,860
Seok Sam.

223
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,130
Stop making a fuss.

224
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,870
Look at you. I thought I had
no customers at my tavern today.

225
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,000
I guess that's because you were
having a birthday party here.

226
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,110
Gosh, Mr. Se Chan.

227
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,650
Mr. Jong Kook,
why did you not call me?

228
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,290
- Me?
- I don't know you.

229
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,050
Yes, you do. You are my darling.

230
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,920
- Darling?
- Of course, you know me.

231
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,180
- Hey, you...
- Hey.

232
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,730
You have Slave Jeon.

233
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,750
(Slave Yang's date,
Slave Jeon steps up.)

234
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,690
No, wait.

235
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,230
(Clanging)

236
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,490
Did you call me darling?

237
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,230
Honey, who is this woman?

238
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,230
- "Honey?" Excuse me, ma'am.
- My gosh.

239
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,000
(Slave Yang was dating two women
before he knew it.)

240
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,230
That's a strange woman.

241
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,000
- Let me tell you why I'm here.
- Okay.

242
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,370
I'm known to be good
at card readings in this village.

243
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,720
I will make it cheap,

244
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,420
so let me know if you want
to have your fortunes read.

245
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,350
- So Min likes stuff like this.
- Right.

246
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,380
I have one coin.

247
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,610
So Min would want to ask her
about her love life.

248
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,750
Read So Min's fortunes first.

249
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,050
Okay.

250
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,730
- Bring one to me.
- Okay.

251
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,360
All right. First...

252
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,660
What do you want to know?

253
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,400
Will I be able to start
seeing someone within this year?

254
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,060
If you'll be seeing
someone within this year?

255
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,060
- I don't think it can happen.
- Let me see.

256
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,800
Here's what you do.

257
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,970
Pick two cards.

258
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,170
(The two cards
will decide her destiny.)

259
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,210
Two cards?

260
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,950
Don't open them yet.

261
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,870
- Is this how it works?
- She picks the cards.

262
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,450
All right. You picked two cards.

263
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,140
Let me see.

264
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,380
- Why are the cards...
- All right.

265
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,720
Let me tell you what these mean.

266
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,690
About your love life...

267
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,090
Things will work out well.

268
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,020
You'll meet someone
within this year.

269
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,100
The bird will bring you good news.

270
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,060
- I see.
- She seems really good.

271
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,100
The bird will bring me good news.

272
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,520
It will bring you good news.

273
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,160
And this is about what he's like.

274
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,230
He's quite playful.

275
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,570
You're likely to meet
someone very playful.

276
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,630
Playful?

277
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,270
(If he's playful...)

278
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,400
It's Yang Se Chan!

279
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,850
Yang Se Chan is my darling.

280
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,870
I don't even know you.
Why would you say that?

281
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,010
What are you talking about?
We went to Jeju Island together.

282
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,880
(What are you talking about?
We went to Jeju Island together.)

283
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,280
I knew it!

284
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,410
- What?
- I can't believe this.

285
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,520
That's her.

286
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,360
She's the one.

287
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,560
Who wants to go next?

288
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,230
- I want to do it.
- Se Chan?

289
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,430
- Ask her about our compatibility.
- All right.

290
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,070
Sit next to him.
Make yourself comfortable.

291
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,260
All right.

292
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,230
You will pick one card each.

293
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,500
Don't open the cards yet.
Just pick one.

294
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,400
- I pick this.
- This one.

295
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,640
(They carefully pick one card each.)

296
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Pick one.

297
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
Good.

298
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,640
- So here's the first card.
- I picked it.

299
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,820
- The image you have about So Min.
- Her image.

300
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,120
And the card you picked shows
the image you have about my darling.

301
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,880
Is this real?

302
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,830
- I think she's real.
- I see.

303
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,790
- The image you have about So Min.
- Her image.

304
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,690
(What does So Min mean to Se Chan?)

305
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,060
What is it?

306
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,140
Is it dung?

307
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,530
(Dung)

308
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,900
Hey!

309
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,930
Am I dung to you?

310
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,530
- He thinks you're dung.
- Am I dung?

311
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,710
- Why?
- What is it?

312
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,710
- No, wait.
- Am I dung?

313
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,910
- Am I dung to you?
- It's a dung card.

314
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,980
- He thinks of me as dung.
- I didn't see this coming.

315
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,140
I picked a poop card.

316
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,310
- Wait. You might've picked one too.
- I said you weren't for each other.

317
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,860
- Poop in dreams means good luck.
- Exactly.

318
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,890
- Let's see what she thinks of him.
- She might've picked a poop card.

319
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,730
(What could Se Chan mean to So Min?)

320
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,290
- It's a poop card!
- My gosh!

321
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,290
(A poop card next to a poop card)

322
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,660
- And it's a double junk card.
- It's a double junk card.

323
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,640
- She picked a poop card too.
- We didn't plan this.

324
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,400
- We both picked a poop card.
- Unbelievable. Another poop card?

325
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,980
(It means
they're meant for each other.)

326
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,140
She thinks of you as poop
more than you do.

327
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,350
(She thinks even more badly of him.)

328
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,350
You think she's a bad one...

329
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,510
- while she thinks you're the worst.
- What are the odds?

330
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,040
- This is unbelievable.
- I think she's a bad one,

331
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,890
- and she thinks I'm the worst?
- You're the worst.

332
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,520
- It's so hard to believe.
- It's unbelievable.

333
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,780
I told you, I have spiritual power.

334
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,630
- Please sit here.
- Okay. I'll try it.

335
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,390
The poop cards made Ji Hyo
believe her.

336
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,020
- I got offered a role.
- You got offered a role?

337
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,190
- Pick two cards.
- Okay.

338
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,690
- This one.
- Good.

339
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,930
- And this one.
- Okay.

340
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,710
Here we go

341
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,030
- It's a September card.
- It's a blue ribbon card.

342
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,170
First, this card symbolizes
a drink or a drinking party.

343
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,480
Also, if you think of the time,

344
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,750
it means an evening or a night.

345
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,280
(A chrysanthemum card means
a drink and a night.)

346
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,360
So you'd be at an advantage if you
shoot a movie or a drama at night.

347
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,460
- Hey, you have a shoot tonight.
- Today is the day, Ji Hyo.

348
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,260
- Exactly. It brings you good luck.
- A night shoot?

349
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,890
- It tells me you're a night owl.
- Yes.

350
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,840
Who's next?
Does anyone else have a question?

351
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,160
- Seok Sam, why don't you try it?
- Okay.

352
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,980
Seok Sam, you should ask
about your life span.

353
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,210
Right, his life span or health.

354
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,140
When will I die?

355
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,440
- When will you die?
- Yes.

356
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,220
Seok Sam, don't ask her about that.

357
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,410
Let's check his life span.

358
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,910
- Please pick one card.
- Okay.

359
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,260
No. You shouldn't open it yet.
Let me look at the card you picked.

360
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,730
I think she's a real fortune teller.

361
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,180
- She must be a real fortune teller.
- Is this for real?

362
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,130
- Here we go
- Here we go

363
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,150
(December, rain)

364
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,830
You chose a rain card.
This card means...

365
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,500
- December. I see.
- Yes, it's a December card.

366
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,890
- This card symbolizes a new guest.
- What?

367
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,530
I think that the Grim Reaper will
pay you a visit.

368
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,610
- The guest must be the Grim Reaper.
- You mean, this year?

369
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,940
- You mean he'll die in December?
- When will that be?

370
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,170
- Seok Sam.
- It's only a few months away.

371
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,810
The Grim Reaper could visit you
within this month.

372
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,510
- There may be someone...
- Just don't follow the Grim Reaper.

373
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,310
- hidden around you.
- Don't follow the Grim Reaper.

374
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,390
- I know.
- Exactly.

375
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,120
Does it have something to do
with the show?

376
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Right.

377
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
What is it?

378
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,150
(Does it have something to do
with today's episode?)

379
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,020
- The King's command!
- What is he doing?

380
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,060
- The King's command!
- What is he doing?

381
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,340
What is it?

382
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,970
- What is the King's command?
- What is it?

383
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,060
"Whatever Penalty Project?"

384
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,430
- "Whatever Penalty Project."
- We just got here.

385
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,880
We just got here.
Why must we get a penalty?

386
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,940
- A penalty?
- Is it a long-term project?

387
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,980
- Yes.
- What is this?

388
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,120
Today,
we'll begin a four-week project...

389
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,040
with legendary penalties
on the line.

390
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,280
(The Running Man penalties
with a long history)

391
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,150
(From bungee jumping
with no cord...)

392
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,920
(The scariest swing in the world,
the Nevis Swing)

393
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,020
(To the 90-degree roller coaster...)

394
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,500
(in Taiwan that's called
the roller coaster to purgatory)

395
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,140
- This is so unexpected.
- It's a four-week project?

396
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,010
- Hyung In, I thought better of you.
- I wonder what the penalties are.

397
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,340
You will receive penalty stickers
throughout the four-week race.

398
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,140
- Two of you will get a penalty.
- Two of us?

399
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
- Not 1, but 2?
- Oh, man.

400
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,220
The members to get a penalty are
those with the most stickers...

401
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,750
and one of the remaining members...

402
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,280
except for the member
with the least penalty stickers.

403
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,360
- Since it's a legendary penalty,
- It must be intense.

404
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,390
we'll receive recommendations
from the viewers...

405
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,050
for the next two weeks.

406
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,060
We'll give you a few examples.

407
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,330
- Activities we can do in Korea...
- What is it?

408
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,890
- First, it's a penalty...
- Is it the sky bicycle?

409
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,890
- that will make you feel fear.
- What is that?

410
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,970
- What is that?
- It's the sky bicycle.

411
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,560
(The scariest penalty that can
give you an adrenaline rush)

412
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,210
- Riding a bicycle in the air?
- Yes, riding a bicycle...

413
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,610
- in the air 50m above the ground.
- Did you say 150m?

414
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,770
- You ride a bicycle on a rope.
- It's suspended in the air.

415
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,980
- Why would you ride it on a rope?
- What's that?

416
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,720
- I can never do that.
- It makes no sense.

417
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,310
- Here's the second example.
- What's that?

418
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,490
It's an upgraded water slide jump.

419
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,550
- Should I jump?
- Oh, that?

420
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,730
You slide down a water slide
and fall from 7m into the water.

421
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,920
- You fall into the water?
- Yes, and the pool is 3m deep.

422
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,730
- Is that a water slide in Korea?
- Yes.

423
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,790
- Hyung In... I mean...
- I saw that on social media.

424
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,840
- I thought she was a nice person.
- What's wrong with her?

425
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,740
Next up is the sky glider
that enables you to fly in the air.

426
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,030
You glide at a height of 125m
above the ground...

427
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,900
at a speed of 80km per hour.

428
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,540
- Look at Haha. He's already scared.
- I don't understand.

429
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,810
- What's her problem?
- Oh, it's suspended in the air.

430
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,810
- You should've discussed it.
- Why did you decide on your own?

431
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,360
She's crueler than Bo Pil.

432
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,960
Also, there's a penalty
that can be a hassle.

433
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,520
- That would be better.
- Yes, that'd be better.

434
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,130
It's to go to Hwacheon
in Gangwon Province...

435
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,330
and mine gold dust
for the other members.

436
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,730
- Come on. That's ridiculous.
- Mining gold dust?

437
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,870
(They've mined gold dust
eight years ago in Australia.)

438
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
- I've tried it before.
- But in Korea...

439
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,480
- There's no gold dust in Korea.
- I couldn't find any gold dust.

440
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,530
- What's gold dust?
- I've tried it before.

441
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,210
- Gold. It means mining gold.
- But in Korea...

442
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,380
- Gold?
- I couldn't find any gold dust.

443
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,440
- It's real gold, right?
- I couldn't find any.

444
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,620
- Are you sure we can find gold?
- Yes. We've done the research.

445
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,540
- So we can find gold dust?
- But it's only an example.

446
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,810
If the viewers suggest better ideas,
we'll choose one of them.

447
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,020
The viewers will find something
even more intense than those.

448
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,860
- We might walk into a fire pit.
- Let's do something easier.

449
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,600
- Let's go with the Nevis Swing.
- What's wrong with them?

450
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,630
- Hey, you don't have to do this.
- Hey, this is...

451
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,730
- She must have lost her mind.
- This is too much.

452
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,970
Today's race is
Whatever Penalty Project, Part One,

453
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,970
Ghostly War of Coins.

454
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,340
You have to get
as many coins as you can...

455
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,640
- to increase your winning chance.
- Got it.

456
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,300
Two of the losers will be given
penalty stickers.

457
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,510
- Let's move to the first mission.
- Okay.

458
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,140
Hyung In, why are you doing this
to us? Are you serious?

459
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,990
I felt dizzy for a moment.

460
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,180
I feel suffocated.

461
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,490
I can never do that.

462
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,890
Gosh, those penalties...
I'd rather mine gold dust.

463
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,130
Getting tanned would be better.

464
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,470
It scares me too much.

465
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,890
Hey, would you go with
the Nevis Swing again?

466
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,760
I'd rather choose the Nevis Swing.

467
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,930
- Really?
- Yes.

468
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,660
Yesterday, I watched the episode
where you rode it.

469
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,300
You should ride it.

470
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,270
- I strongly recommend it.
- No, I would never ride it.

471
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,610
- You should...
- Seok Sam.

472
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,120
You see... Lord Yoo.

473
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,180
My gosh.

474
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,510
Lord Yoo, would you choose
the Nevis Swing or bungee jumping?

475
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,780
Well... I hate both.

476
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,130
We thought the aristocrats would
give the slaves some coins.

477
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,150
- They didn't give us any coins.
- We would never do that.

478
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,630
- We were wrong.
- Come on.

479
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,470
- What do you take them for?
- What are you talking about?

480
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,760
- Don't you know how they can be?
- What do you take us for?

481
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,030
I'll just...

482
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,300
- run away.
- Making money isn't easy.

483
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,210
- I'll run away.
- I gave out the most among us.

484
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,270
- They didn't give out any coins.
- I gave them a few coins.

485
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,670
But you're too stingy.

486
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,380
Besides, you revealed
how intense our penalty could be.

487
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,170
- They'll be even more stingy.
- That's right.

488
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,350
- Of course.
- Okay.

489
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,620
- What should we do to get a coin?
- Give him a coin.

490
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,590
(Right then)

491
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,250
My gosh. That scared me.

492
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,130
(Everyone is
scared out of their wits.)

493
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,140
(Two mysterious men came out
through the wall.)

494
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,770
- Don't come near me.
- My gosh.

495
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,700
- That was scary.
- They scared the life out of me.

496
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,200
(The mysterious shadows
slowly approach the members.)

497
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,280
Are you Ji Suk Jin
from Running Village?

498
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,140
Yes, that's me.

499
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,350
Your time has come.

500
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,790
- I've come for you.
- Me?

501
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,890
(Suk Jin's time has come to die?)

502
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,210
- His time has come.
- Wait.

503
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm not ready yet.

504
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,650
(The Grim Reaper gives him
something.)

505
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,890
(Joseon Book of Fate)

506
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,870
(The book where the life span
of people in Joseon is written)

507
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,140
- What's going on?
- For real?

508
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,730
- He said your time had come.
- Suk Jin.

509
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,540
- But...
- Are you leaving?

510
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,640
I guess so.

511
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,970
- Where are you going?
- "Ji Suk Jin..."

512
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,840
I guess I'm going to die at 8:50 p.m.

513
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,970
(Ji Suk Jin's life ends
at 8:50 p.m.)

514
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,670
- Are they Grim Reapers?
- I think so.

515
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,780
- She said he would die soon.
- I guess I'm going to die.

516
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,140
The fortune teller said
I would die soon.

517
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,620
But I'm not ready yet...

518
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,590
- I thought he was Kim Joon Hyun.
- He startled me.

519
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,560
- I thought he was Kang Ho Dong.
- That was scary.

520
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,680
- It was okay when it was dark here.
- The fortune teller said it too.

521
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,650
They must be embarrassed
since it's bright now.

522
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,370
- They look cute under the light.
- Under the light...

523
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,030
- I can tell who they are.
- Joon Hyun.

524
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,400
Their job is to eliminate
the members who are about to die.

525
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,640
- Suk Jin is going to die soon...
- Let's save him. We'll save him.

526
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,140
- Why?
- Please save me.

527
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,940
The time you just checked
in the book is...

528
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,550
- It was 8:50 p.m.
- the time when you get eliminated.

529
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,970
- What time is it now?
- Will he get eliminated?

530
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,380
It's 8:03 p.m. right now.

531
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,620
- I still have 47 minutes left.
- Yes.

532
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,560
The other members' times of death
have also been decided.

533
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,360
The anger disorder that has been
going around Running Village...

534
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,390
influenced each member's life span
greatly.

535
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,450
The anger disorder?

536
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,530
(Estimated time of elimination:
10 p.m.)

537
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,390
(Slave Ji was picked on
even from the opening.)

538
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,200
(Estimated time of elimination:
9:50 p.m.)

539
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,500
(He had to hold back his anger
even when he was hit in the head.)

540
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,640
(Estimated time of elimination:
9:30 p.m.)

541
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
(His life span was shortened
whenever he held back his anger.)

542
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,200
Oh, that's why my life span was
shortened?

543
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,740
Jae Suk, I bet you'll live long.

544
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,820
- I guess I'll live long.
- So will Ji Hyo.

545
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,020
- I'll live long too.
- Now...

546
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,410
The time of death is written
in each member's book.

547
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,590
(Each member's life span is written
in the Book of Fate.)

548
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,060
When your time comes, you get
eliminated and become a ghost.

549
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,720
(When the time comes, the member is
eliminated and becomes a ghost.)

550
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,830
You have to go and find your book
where your time of death is written.

551
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,270
The books are hidden
in two different places.

552
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,310
It's scary.

553
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,070
It's too scary for me to go alone.

554
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,970
Also, there are coins
hidden in different places.

555
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,880
- You can keep the coins you find.
- I'm worried.

556
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,380
You'll be divided into teams
to search for the books.

557
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,050
- I'm relieved.
- The members of the first team...

558
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,350
are Jae Suk and So Min.

559
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,680
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are
on the second team.

560
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,680
I went into the Haunted Hospital
with So Min.

561
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,360
Both of us were so scared.

562
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,720
All right.

563
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,800
So Min, let's go.

564
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,300
- Jong Kook, let's go.
- Okay.

565
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,720
I really hate things like this.
I'm worried.

566
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,800
Gosh. I hate this the most.

567
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,040
Can I take it out?

568
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,900
Gosh. It looks scary
now that it's dark outside.

569
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,730
(It looked peaceful during the day.)

570
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,200
- Gosh. I'm scared.
- Oh, man.

571
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,500
- This is driving me nuts.
- All right.

572
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,940
We have to go out there.

573
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,670
We just have to find our books,
right?

574
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,670
Correct.

575
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,240
We'll see them anyway.

576
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,050
I'm sorry,
but am I allowed to hit the ghosts?

577
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,820
How should we find the books
when it's so dark?

578
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,360
There must be a way.

579
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,830
(They can't come back
until they find their books.)

580
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,750
There will probably be some ghosts
around the thatched cottages...

581
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,150
reading a book or something.

582
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,890
We should check if it's ours.

583
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,690
This is why
the staff members hate you.

584
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,500
- Why?
- Don't predict what will happen.

585
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,640
- It's not like that.
- Think of the staff members.

586
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,000
We have to think
about what we might face.

587
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,730
- Don't go too far.
- That's what they hate.

588
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,610
- You see the red light, right?
- We should go and check it.

589
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,120
- What? Let's go over there.
- Oh, gosh. That looks so scary.

590
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,820
I'm sure
we can find our books there.

591
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,640
- Look at that. It's so red.
- Let's check it out.

592
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,140
- It's so red.
- Let's check it out.

593
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,150
- But we...
- Hey, Ji Hyo, how could you...

594
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,650
Jae Suk, let's go together.

595
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,090
- Let's go.
- Let's go and check it out.

596
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,950
- Gosh.
- We don't know where our books are.

597
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,370
- Let's go.
- Look at the red light.

598
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,270
I don't think I can go in there.

599
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,100
Hurry up, guys.
Hey, this is the place...

600
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,070
- The props are so scary.
- It's a shaman's shrine.

601
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm afraid something might come out.

602
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,280
- What is he doing?
- What?

603
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,700
- He thinks he's a tour guide.
- There's a shrine...

604
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,640
- Why is he acting up?
- It's not like that.

605
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,400
- That's a shrine.
- What?

606
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,640
This looks so creepy.

607
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,050
- Hurry up and come up.
- My shoelace got untied.

608
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,140
- So Min, what's wrong with you?
- Jae Suk.

609
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,440
- Is it because of the disease?
- So Min, hurry up.

610
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,180
- I'm not lying. My throat is...
- I can't see. I need a flashlight.

611
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,650
(Screaming)

612
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,250
- You scared me. What's going on?
- What's wrong with you?

613
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,250
- What was that about?
- I'm sorry.

614
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,300
(Screaming)

615
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,830
- You jerk!
- Hey.

616
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,630
- Now, let's go.
- I feel dizzy.

617
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,660
- Let's go.
- Hey, Ji Hyo.

618
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,870
Why did you curse at him?

619
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,040
- Hey, Ji Hyo, why...
- Gosh, you. Don't do that again.

620
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,840
- Let's go.
- Ji Hyo, why would you curse?

621
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,730
- Let's go.
- Don't do that. I'm warning you.

622
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,110
- All right. Come on.
- I hate him.

623
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,350
- Hurry up.
- He must be out of his mind.

624
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,320
- What's his problem?
- My gosh.

625
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,910
I hear music.

626
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,020
Why? What is it?

627
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,290
(Meanwhile, it's being broadcast
live for the other members.)

628
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,520
- Jong Kook is...
- What's this? Shall I take it off?

629
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,910
Jong Kook is pretending
he's enjoying it, right?

630
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,650
I bet that So Min and Jae Suk won't
be able to find their books.

631
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,060
- It's over for them.
- We don't know where the books are.

632
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,720
Gosh, I have enteritis.
Why today of all days?

633
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,890
Haha, just let it go.

634
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,540
Let us know if that happens.
We'll bring you clean pants.

635
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,140
- You should shoot inserts though.
- No wonder why...

636
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,430
- Let them shoot inserts after that.
- Pee your pants.

637
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,970
Young Jin brought
an extra pair of underwear for me.

638
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,470
I asked, "Will I get wet today?"
Then he said, "I think you will."

639
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
Or do you have a cork,
by any chance?

640
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,850
(He's going to plug it
if it's necessary.)

641
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,850
I'm not joking. I couldn't
get out of bed for three days.

642
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,090
In my bedroom,
just like Niagara Falls...

643
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,720
Do you think they blocked it?

644
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,390
So Min,
I don't think I can go there.

645
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,920
I'll just die.

646
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,950
(I'll just die.)

647
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,160
- We have to find coins too.
- Hurry up.

648
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,660
- Jae Suk.
- Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

649
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,370
- Hurry up.
- A yellow pouch...

650
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,570
(The tour guide is acting up again.)

651
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,870
- Jae Suk, hurry up.
- A yellow pouch.

652
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,040
- What is...
- I'm afraid of dying too.

653
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,930
- The Grim Reaper will show up.
- There's something over there.

654
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,500
- What's that?
- There's something over there.

655
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
This is too scary.

656
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,080
- You should go first.
- Hurry up.

657
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,780
Your reactions will be funnier.

658
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,170
- Gosh. What is this?
- Where is it?

659
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,140
- Gosh. Let go of me.
- There...

660
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,120
- I see some objects tied there.
- Ji Hyo.

661
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,150
- Ji Hyo.
- That startled me.

662
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,450
Then...

663
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,560
(Slave Kim leaves them alone
at the entrance.)

664
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,150
- Good luck.
- So Min.

665
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,290
- Hey.
- Let me go with you, Jong Kook.

666
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,450
- Good luck.
- Let me go with you, Ji Hyo.

667
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,150
- So Min.
- I don't want to be with him.

668
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,460
- Jae Suk.
- He's such a scaredy-cat. Oh, gosh.

669
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,460
I hope...

670
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,730
(Gosh! What's that?)

671
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,340
- Gosh! What's that?
- Oh, man.

672
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,430
- Kim Jong Kook, that punk.
- He startled me.

673
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,640
- Good luck. Let's go.
- Don't you just...

674
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,110
Don't you hate the sight of him?

675
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,840
- Let's go.
- My goodness.

676
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,170
I hope you make it back alive.

677
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,620
Let's meet again alive.

678
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,640
(Left: Aristocrat's House,
right: Ghost's Room)

679
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,740
- Let's go to Aristocrat's House.
- Aristocrat's House?

680
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,150
(The cowardly siblings are left
alone together.)

681
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,890
Jae Suk, you go first.

682
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,950
Touch the objects
to see what they are.

683
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,300
I'm warning you.
I'll leave once I find my book.

684
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,190
I'll leave you here alone and run.

685
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,990
- Do you understand?
- When I find my book,

686
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,270
- I'll leave you...
- Oh, gosh.

687
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,870
- You scared me. Hey.
- It's just a leaf.

688
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,000
- I'm sorry.
- I won't let you off.

689
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,110
Jae Suk.

690
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,380
Should we go inside?
What are we supposed to do?

691
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,700
I think we should go inside.

692
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,400
- It's so dark in there.
- What's this?

693
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,090
There's a phone here.
Who is Jung So Yeon?

694
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,440
Leave it.

695
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,450
(She talks nonsense
because she doesn't want to go in.)

696
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,750
Gosh.
I really don't want to go in there.

697
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,950
- Are they still outside?
- Are they still outside?

698
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,560
- Come on. Please.
- When will you go in?

699
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,630
Gosh.

700
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,220
I'll show you a rare video.

701
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,270
(Seok Sam offered to show them a video
when they were getting bored.)

702
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,800
Here. Watch this video.
It's interesting.

703
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,960
- It's a swing.
- It's a swing.

704
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,930
- It's being moved by the wind.
- Yes.

705
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,610
- Hey!
- Gosh! Darn.

706
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,610
(Screaming)

707
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,710
My gosh. What's wrong with him?

708
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,740
(Happy)

709
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,910
(His sphincter muscles relaxed
for a moment.)

710
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,910
That was so funny.

711
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,450
I'm sorry,
but can you give me wet tissues?

712
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,560
That was terribly scary.

713
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,890
(He ended up peeing his pants
even before going outside.)

714
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,270
Won't you...

715
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,030
- Won't you go with us?
- This place looks so scary.

716
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,460
- It means we should go in there.
- Won't you go with us?

717
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,430
Won't the cameramen go with us?

718
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,500
Jae Suk, what will you...

719
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,200
Jae Suk, what...

720
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,110
(He kicked in the air.)

721
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,910
We have no choice but to go in.

722
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,050
Seriously, this is driving me crazy.

723
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,440
Oh, gosh.

724
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
(The hallway looks eerie.)

725
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,650
I think we have to go in there.
Oh, gosh.

726
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,950
(I think we have to go in there.)

727
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,250
Let's go in there.

728
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,250
That wasn't it.

729
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,250
Right. We should go in there.
But I can't. It drives me nuts.

730
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,570
Won't you go with us?
They turned off the lights.

731
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,140
Gosh, I feel like I'm going crazy.
Let's go.

732
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,540
(They have to come in here
without the staff members.)

733
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,380
- Gosh. This is driving me nuts.
- Exactly.

734
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,140
(But they have no choice
if they want to find their books.)

735
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,430
This is driving me nuts.

736
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,410
(Jae Suk reached the entrance.)

737
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,660
Gosh. This place is too scary.

738
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,590
- Gosh!
- That startled me.

739
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,400
- What was the noise?
- I'm so scared.

740
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,560
I heard a weird noise in there.

741
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,400
Gosh. I feel like I'm going crazy.

742
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,030
(Snorting)

743
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,330
Cameraman, please come with us.

744
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,800
Please come inside with us.

745
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,800
- I can't go in there.
- I heard a weird noise.

746
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,000
Come on. Please come with us.

747
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,340
No, I can't.

748
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,950
(He begs the cameraman
who's working hard.)

749
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,840
(The situation is being broadcast.)

750
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,660
Gosh, you punks.
Will you shoot the show all night?

751
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,720
Gosh!

752
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,750
Hey, set a time limit.

753
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,930
Right. Tell them they failed.

754
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,550
- Are they idiots or what?
- What?

755
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,900
- Aren't there... Oh, they're alone.
- Are they idiots?

756
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,470
- Aren't the cameramen with them?
- I see.

757
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,520
No, they're not with the members.

758
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,400
- Then I understand them.
- I wouldn't be able to go in.

759
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,760
Then I wouldn't be able to go in.

760
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,560
- There's no camera. I understand.
- Exactly.

761
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,440
- I'd go in if they go with me.
- The cameramen aren't with them.

762
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,230
- Really? Then it's understandable.
- They're not in there.

763
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,000
In that case,
we should understand them.

764
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,000
- I fully understand them.
- That's too scary.

765
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,420
What did you prepare
for today's episode?

766
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,720
Jae Suk, come on. Lead the way.

767
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,810
(The cowardly siblings go back in
since they have no choice.)

768
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,820
- It won't end if we don't go in.
- Gosh.

769
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,250
Do you understand?
It won't end if we don't go in.

770
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,790
Then what should we do?

771
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,300
- Gosh.
- I really don't think I can go in.

772
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,730
This is the worst.

773
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,610
- I can, but I don't want to.
- I feel...

774
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,710
That means you can't go in.

775
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,150
- No. I can go in, but...
- Then you should go first.

776
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,840
I can go in, but I don't want to.

777
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,780
It's a little brighter in here.

778
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,010
(The herbal medicine store is
covered with blood.)

779
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,890
(Grunting)

780
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,320
I feel like something will come out.
I can't go in. What should I do?

781
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,130
What's this?

782
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,130
(But she must go in
to find her book.)

783
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,490
Right. I'll think of this room
as a drama filming set...

784
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,200
Oh, I get it. I know now.

785
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,470
- What do you mean? Yes.
- We saw a phone out there.

786
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,230
Ms. Jung So Yeon, please come out.

787
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,030
- She must be in here.
- What was that? Quiet down.

788
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,920
Ms. Jung So Yeon, please come out.
She must be in here.

789
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,740
I think
she put her phone out there...

790
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,510
because she had to come inside.

791
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,750
- Don't you think so?
- Stop talking and come inside.

792
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,750
Come on in. Come over here.
Hurry up.

793
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,820
Hurry up and come here.

794
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,860
Let's go together.

795
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,930
(After a quarrel, they entered
the first course at last.)

796
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,700
Gosh. I don't think I can go.
What should I do?

797
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,260
Gosh.

798
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,970
Oh, my gosh!

799
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,610
Oh, my gosh!

800
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,410
I told you not to do that.

801
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,740
I really hate
being scared like that.

802
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,070
- Gosh. What do I do?
- Hey...

803
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,450
Don't do that.

804
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,390
- I really hate this.
- Seriously.

805
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,360
- What should I do? Gosh.
- Oh, man.

806
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,660
- My goodness. Sir.
- Gosh, seriously.

807
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,460
Thank you for your hard work, sir.

808
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
He touched me as he left.
My goodness.

809
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,760
- Gosh.
- I'm so scared.

810
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,630
- I'm sorry, sir.
- He scared the life out of me.

811
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,560
- Sir...
- Come here, So Min, will you?

812
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,330
- Sir, I'm sorry for getting angry.
- Hurry up.

813
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,830
- Come here.
- You must've been surprised.

814
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,650
Really? That must be...
There are trees around it.

815
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,310
That's a place
where rituals are held, right?

816
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,510
This is where...

817
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,920
You pray with
a bowl of water, right?

818
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,780
- It's a shrine.
- This is the place.

819
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,460
- This is it.
- The spirit that protects us.

820
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,460
- People pray here.
- Stack three stones, bow thrice,

821
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,080
and spit thrice for good fortune.

822
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,550
Why don't we try it?

823
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,960
Stack three stones.

824
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,130
- Stack three stones.
- Right.

825
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,090
Like this.

826
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,700
(They suddenly decide
to say a prayer.)

827
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,970
Three stones.

828
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,140
There we go.

829
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,640
And bow thrice.

830
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,300
(With respect)

831
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,270
And spit.

832
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,710
(Spit!)

833
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,120
- Hold on a second.
- Hurry.

834
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,270
Is this allowed to be aired on TV?

835
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,190
(After an embarrassing attempt,
they head out to find the book.)

836
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,310
I'm sure luck will find us now.

837
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,160
Who knew folk village
would be this scary at night?

838
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,080
What's this?
Wouldn't there be something here?

839
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,520
What is this?

840
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,400
- This...
- Open it, Jong Kook.

841
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,170
What if something jumps out?

842
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,990
- Open it.
- This?

843
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,370
Open it.

844
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,970
(Slave Kim's voice goes up a notch
when he sees something suspicious.)

845
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,670
There's something here.

846
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,110
- Really?
- There is.

847
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,300
(Flinching)

848
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,650
Where are you going?

849
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,720
(She runs for her life.)

850
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,950
(Screaming)

851
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,120
I wish they get so startled
that they kiss.

852
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,280
(I wish they get so startled
that they kiss.)

853
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,730
You be Ji Hyo,
and I'll be Jong Kook.

854
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,090
"Get over here."

855
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,320
(Kissing because they're startled?)

856
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,970
- They have a reason to kiss.
- Right.

857
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,560
"Let's go that way."

858
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,710
(The father of three
enjoys his fantasy.)

859
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,880
Why are you coming to me?

860
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,570
You jerk!

861
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,650
(You jerk!)

862
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,570
Ji Hyo's showing her temper.

863
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,420
Leave me alone, will you?

864
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,540
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook
ended up separated.)

865
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,690
(She hears the sound
of drumming bats.)

866
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,580
There it is.

867
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,960
There it is.

868
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,750
Miss.

869
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,140
(She cautiously moves closer.)

870
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,210
(Tap)

871
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,980
(Peek-a-boo!)

872
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,540
(The granny's face is the same
as the back of her head.)

873
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,980
(Screaming)

874
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,240
Jong Kook!

875
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,920
Jong Kook!

876
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,010
(She ran away
without putting her shoes on.)

877
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,480
(The granny adjusts her wig.)

878
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,960
You frightened me once
which is enough.

879
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,260
Here you go.

880
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,530
Just pass me the book.

881
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,470
Thank you.

882
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,800
Stop...

883
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,570
(Screaming)

884
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,120
You're too scary.

885
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,160
(Where's my bat?)

886
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,620
I'm going to go home.

887
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,050
(Ji Hyo still managed
to collect the book.)

888
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,230
Darn it.

889
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,630
Are you kidding me?

890
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,790
(Fooled you!)

891
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,330
Give me the real one.

892
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,330
(Some books are fake.)

893
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,640
Where's the real one?

894
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,800
(While Ji Hyo wanders
to find the book...)

895
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,830
- When will this be over?
- Darn it.

896
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,830
Look for the book, Jae Suk.

897
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,410
So Min, why is this so long?

898
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,070
- What...
- I can't go any further.

899
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,390
I hate this eerie sound.

900
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,080
So Min, I'm stuck.

901
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,750
So Min, I'm stuck!

902
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,250
Stuck where?

903
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,630
I'm stuck. Help me out of this.

904
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,730
- Help.
- How?

905
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,860
- This snapped.
- What is it?

906
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,490
- What?
- This snapped.

907
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,200
- Where?
- This got caught and snapped.

908
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,560
- This...
- This got caught.

909
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,870
- You startled me.
- Darn it.

910
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,260
Did someone grab you?

911
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,530
- No.
- Did it get caught?

912
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,370
- Yes, this got caught.
- You startled me.

913
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,880
- Are you good now?
- Yes, I'm good.

914
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,140
You need to film this though.

915
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,910
(Hi!)

916
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,920
Just a second.

917
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,920
(Screaming)

918
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,280
Just a second.

919
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,980
(Jae Suk, So Min)

920
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,120
Just a second.

921
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,720
(They make a U-turn
only after taking a few steps.)

922
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,160
Oh, no. What are we going
to do with your camera?

923
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,200
- Put it back together.
- Hold on.

924
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,320
Wait a second.

925
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,870
(They still maintain
their professionalism.)

926
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,430
How can the camera
be the issue right now?

927
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,140
My survival is more important.

928
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,490
Still, we should...

929
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,790
This actually broke.

930
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,330
It must have snapped.

931
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,710
This is killing me.

932
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,680
- I'll film you instead.
- This will do.

933
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,150
This got caught here.

934
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,800
- What now?
- She's still here.

935
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,420
She's looking at us.

936
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,240
- I can't go any further.
- She's looking at us.

937
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,340
We'll move past her.

938
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,510
We'll just walk past you.

939
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,750
Ma'am, please. I'm terrified enough.

940
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,690
No, don't. Please don't do this.

941
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,990
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

942
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,400
Let us walk past you.

943
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,060
(Hand shoots out.)

944
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,200
I told you not to do that.

945
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,260
(Seriously?)

946
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
(What the...)

947
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,800
The ghosts are too scary.

948
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,110
(Jae Suk makes a fuss
even though the ghost did nothing.)

949
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,410
Let's take a breather.

950
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,650
Oh, no.

951
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,170
- Come this way.
- No, I won't.

952
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,650
- Come this way.
- I won't!

953
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,170
- I can't do this.
- Come this way.

954
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,710
I won't.

955
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,610
Tell her that I won't go.

956
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,110
- Come this way.
- We won't.

957
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,420
- Come this way.
- We won't!

958
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,050
- We won't.
- We won't.

959
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,420
- We won't go over there.
- We won't go over there.

960
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,230
- Come this way.
- No!

961
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,260
- Come this way.
- We don't want to.

962
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,630
- Come this way.
- We won't go there.

963
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,630
We have no choice though.

964
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,800
Come this way.

965
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,480
- That's enough.
- Come this way.

966
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,880
That's enough.

967
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,170
(Jae Suk is beginning
to get annoyed.)

968
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,980
- I don't want to go there.
- Come this way.

969
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,740
Come this way.

970
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,550
(Darn it!)

971
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,690
Jae Suk!

972
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,150
(They even drop the camera.)

973
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,030
That really frightened me.

974
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,360
- My gosh. I can't believe it.
- Seriously?

975
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,730
(Groaning)

976
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,260
My gosh.

977
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,440
- Are you kidding me?
- My gosh.

978
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,010
Unbelievable.

979
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,070
(Wailing)

980
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,880
Jae Suk.

981
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,380
You need to pick up your camera.

982
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,570
(Darn...)

983
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,670
My gosh.

984
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,170
Pick up your camera.

985
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,420
- Jae Suk, let me take a breather.
- So Min.

986
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,150
- I can't do this.
- This is impossible.

987
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,010
- The hallway's too long.
- I'm exhausted.

988
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,260
My throat's already hoarse.

989
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,260
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo is
searching the house.)

990
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,130
Where is the notebook?

991
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,260
Come out here and I'll smack you.

992
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,240
I mean it.

993
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,010
Why are you in my house?
What are you here to steal?

994
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,650
You... How dare you.

995
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,780
You... Get lost.

996
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,780
- Get out!
- The notebook!

997
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,990
Fine. Just leave.

998
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,280
Go!

999
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,610
I'll take this though.

1000
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,280
I'll take this.

1001
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,820
I'll leave with this.

1002
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,030
I'm taking this!

1003
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,530
(Ji Hyo finds the book
after a hand-to-hand combat.)

1004
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,300
I'll kill you all.

1005
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,990
See how angry I am.

1006
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,510
This is insane.

1007
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,980
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook searches
another house.)

1008
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,980
(His eyes widen.)

1009
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,610
What's this?

1010
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,260
Who's there?

1011
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,920
(Groaning)

1012
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,090
- Who's there?
- My gosh.

1013
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,820
Right. So what now?

1014
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,590
- Leave.
- Should I leave?

1015
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,400
But I can't.

1016
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,070
I need to find something first.

1017
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,460
You look really scary though.

1018
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,210
I need to find something, okay?

1019
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,980
You look really scary though.
Hold on a second.

1020
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,840
I need to find something.

1021
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,210
(They're playing pat-a-cake.)

1022
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,610
- Rock...
- Sorry?

1023
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,010
- Rock...
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1024
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,590
Again. Rock-paper-scissors.

1025
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,280
Is "rock" what you can only play?

1026
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,590
- Leave.
- How about a best of three?

1027
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,780
A best of three.

1028
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,050
Rock-paper-scissors.

1029
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,360
Okay, good.

1030
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,990
Rock-paper-scissors.

1031
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,090
Okay.

1032
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,090
(Fine. Take it.)

1033
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,420
Thanks.

1034
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,840
Thank you. Allow me to take a look.

1035
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,590
I'll use it for good.

1036
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,610
I'll find the book
and use it for good.

1037
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,300
Hold on a second.

1038
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,940
This...

1039
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,570
(Jong Kook finds his Book of Fate.)

1040
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,710
Here we go.

1041
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,550
Why didn't you tell me?

1042
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,780
Leave.

1043
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,760
Right. Thank you.

1044
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,650
I'll get going now.

1045
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,820
The others will be in shock.

1046
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,130
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook
find their Book of Fate.)

1047
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,230
Gosh.

1048
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,300
(Screaming)

1049
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,670
This is super annoying. I hate this.

1050
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,090
I can already picture the scene.

1051
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,110
There's no reason for me
to go in there.

1052
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,710
- I already found mine.
- He should find the coins alone.

1053
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,510
I don't want any of the coins.

1054
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,300
That'll take you one step closer
to receiving the penalty.

1055
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,880
- I'm good with that.
- You'll be at risk.

1056
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,820
- I don't want the coins.
- The others are taking too long...

1057
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,380
which means you only have
a short amount of time to live.

1058
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,380
What happens when you die?

1059
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,420
Will I get dragged away?

1060
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,550
You'll become a ghost.

1061
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,210
Darn it!

1062
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,150
(He's close
to turning into a ghost.)

1063
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,650
Darn it!

1064
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,460
I want to live though.

1065
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,820
(He'll be reborn as a ghost.)

1066
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,050
- Is it over for you?
- I mean it.

1067
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,300
What's the time?

1068
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,960
- Get going.
- I barely lived my life.

1069
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,300
This is bad.

1070
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,740
- Why don't you...
- Just so you know,

1071
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,260
I'll die in 15 minutes.

1072
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,070
Seriously. How is this fair?

1073
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,030
Suk Jin, I can't see
the lower half of your body.

1074
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,550
- Oh, no!
- Where did my legs go?

1075
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,940
- Where did they go?
- I'm already dying.

1076
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,210
I only have 17 minutes left to live.

1077
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,650
Why can't we see any of the books?

1078
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,280
As if. Just get back here, will you?

1079
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,530
- Let me at least get some coins.
- It's over for him.

1080
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,820
One shouldn't be broke
when entering the afterlife.

1081
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,190
- Jong Kook's back.
- Here you go.

1082
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,400
It was a blast.

1083
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,590
(Slave Kim returns.)

1084
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,920
- How was it?
- How did it go?

1085
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,190
You'll split up
even if you go as a group.

1086
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,530
- Really?
- I see.

1087
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,710
But Jae Suk and So Min
are still together.

1088
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,010
Yes, I know.

1089
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,030
- Why did we split up?
- Please...

1090
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,440
- Seriously?
- Bye, Suk Jin.

1091
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,150
- Me?
- Suk Jin will leave us.

1092
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,240
Is it time?

1093
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,050
- But the time...
- They're taking too long!

1094
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,510
Should I go?

1095
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,860
Your upper body has disappeared.

1096
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,590
I still have time.

1097
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,590
- Are you a ghost?
- I can see your face only.

1098
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,090
Joon Hyun and Sung Kook...

1099
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,320
came and...

1100
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,300
- I can't see them.
- This is driving me crazy.

1101
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,170
Why can I see your face only?

1102
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,240
- Do you want to see something cool?
- Yes.

1103
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,710
Watch this cool video.

1104
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:04,630
It's interesting.

1105
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,110
It's the wind that moves the swing.

1106
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,550
The wind.

1107
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,610
(A ghost will appear in 3 seconds.)

1108
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,150
(Flinching)

1109
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,690
Wait. Jong Kook.

1110
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,490
Joon Hyun in the back
was really surprised.

1111
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,630
(Surprised)

1112
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,490
(A ghost surprised by another ghost)

1113
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,900
Is Joon Hyun a Grim Reaper?

1114
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,740
The Grim Reaper flinched.

1115
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,440
My stomach hurts. Did he do that?

1116
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,740
He...

1117
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,740
flinched like this.

1118
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,510
It kind of relieves me
hearing that he was surprised.

1119
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,240
- He's a human.
- He's a human.

1120
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,840
- He's so cute.
- He's so cute.

1121
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,010
(Grim Reaper Joon Hyun
is so much like a human.)

1122
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,380
Why is his flinching so funny?

1123
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,990
My stomach hurts. It was hilarious.

1124
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,110
It's funny.

1125
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,780
Tell them to come quickly.

1126
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,420
Excuse me, do you know
where the Book of Fate is?

1127
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,460
(The scaredy-cats are still moving
like a snail.)

1128
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,690
(The ghost who can't stand it
anymore rushes them.)

1129
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,960
So Min.

1130
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,670
Why is it so long?

1131
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,400
(They didn't even have a glimpse
of the Book of Fate.)

1132
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,280
Look at this.

1133
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,550
Save me.

1134
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,510
Save me.

1135
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,880
Save me.

1136
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,280
- I found it.
- Is it yours?

1137
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,110
(Jae Suk found the Book of Fate.)

1138
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,210
(I found it!)

1139
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,420
- No. Don't go.
- I found it.

1140
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,130
- Please don't go.
- I found it.

1141
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,490
Don't go. Is it yours?

1142
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,670
- It's mine.
- Isn't it mine?

1143
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,760
- It's mine.
- Don't go.

1144
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,570
- Okay, So Min. I found it.
- Don't go.

1145
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,990
I found it, So Min.

1146
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,130
- Please don't go.
- What did you say to me?

1147
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,880
I'm telling you. If I find it,
I'll leave by myself immediately.

1148
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,940
- I'm sorry. I was wrong.
- What did you say to me?

1149
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,110
- I was wrong. Don't go.
- You said you would leave.

1150
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,380
I'll treat you better.

1151
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,280
You told me not to stop you.

1152
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,880
Please.

1153
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,320
Don't go, okay?

1154
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,650
(She calms down for now
and starts moving.)

1155
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,820
Let's go for now.

1156
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,880
- Let's go for now.
- Where is mine?

1157
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,030
Let's go for now.

1158
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,300
- Where is mine?
- Let's go for now.

1159
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,960
Where is mine?

1160
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,400
- What is this?
- It'd be where I can see, right?

1161
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,990
What's this? Oh, my.

1162
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,670
(Screaming)

1163
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,550
- It's alive.
- Jae Suk.

1164
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:25,010
- It's alive.
- Oh, my goodness. Wait.

1165
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,050
- It's alive.
- Oh, my goodness.

1166
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,820
(Running away as fast as they can)

1167
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,050
Wait.

1168
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,050
(Coming back to the room
where they were right before)

1169
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,460
I thought it was a doll.

1170
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,730
This is driving me crazy.

1171
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,230
Why is the Book of Fate his
and not mine?

1172
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,490
- I'll leave.
- No, Jae Suk.

1173
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,960
- Jae Suk. Please.
- I'll go.

1174
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,800
- I'll go if you talk like this.
- I'm sorry.

1175
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,210
- Okay?
- I'm sorry. I did wrong.

1176
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,360
Oh, my goodness.

1177
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,530
Until when will they get surprised?

1178
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,650
Those punks.
My life is about to end.

1179
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,240
Suk Jin.

1180
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,240
(Current time: 8:49 p.m.,
Suk Jin: 8:50 p.m.)

1181
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,190
Your lifespan is over.

1182
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,210
(His lifespan ended.)

1183
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,150
Now, you became a ghost.

1184
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,880
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1185
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:11,130
- Hey.
- Suk Jin.

1186
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,030
Take care of Hyun Woo, my son.

1187
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,090
(Seok Sam died
even before the real race began.)

1188
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,670
- Hey.
- Suk Jin.

1189
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,740
Hey.

1190
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,510
- Seok Sam.
- Suk Jin.

1191
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,960
Gosh, how did this happen?

1192
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:24,510
I couldn't even enjoy my life.

1193
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,670
(The scaredy-cats unintentionally
ended Seok Sam's life.)

1194
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,300
- It's still not over.
- When will this end, So Min?

1195
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,940
(They're still wandering around.)

1196
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,150
My goodness.

1197
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,880
When will this be over?

1198
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,590
It's here.

1199
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,650
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

1200
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,820
It's here.

1201
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,360
(Frightened to death)

1202
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,900
What should I do?

1203
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,960
(Locust jumped back out of fear.)

1204
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,990
Hey.

1205
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,030
Hey, it's here. So Bal's book.

1206
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,610
(But he found
So Bal's Book of Fate.)

1207
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,880
(Book of Fate, So Min)

1208
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,510
- Hey.
- Oh, my.

1209
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,280
- Jae Suk.
- Come out quickly now.

1210
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,550
- Hurry up.
- Wait for me.

1211
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,840
Hurry up.
We should go out quickly now.

1212
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,550
(They obtained two books.
All they have to do is go out!)

1213
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,260
(A shaman ghost was guarding
the way to escape.)

1214
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,630
Please.

1215
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,920
Please.

1216
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,030
- Please.
- I'm so scared.

1217
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,210
(Swinging)

1218
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,210
She told us to go out this way.

1219
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,300
- She told us to go out, but how?
- How?

1220
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,110
- How can we go out?
- It has just begun, you punks.

1221
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,300
- What?
- What has begun?

1222
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,110
- What is it?
- What...

1223
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,780
It has just begun, you punks.

1224
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,990
- What?
- What has begun?

1225
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,710
(The exorcism began.)

1226
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,880
The door won't open.

1227
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,860
- The door won't open.
- This is annoying.

1228
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,090
What is going on?

1229
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,530
- The door won't open.
- Oh, no.

1230
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:48,820
- What's this?
- Hold on.

1231
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,130
- Hold on. Open the door for us.
- What's this?

1232
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,260
The door won't open.

1233
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,420
(Shouting)

1234
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,800
- Be careful.
- Oh, my gosh.

1235
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,030
I really can't go.

1236
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,860
(The search for
the Book of Fate ended.)

1237
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,070
Gosh, please don't do it.

1238
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:06,010
I'm sorry.

1239
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,880
I'm so tired.

1240
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,050
I'm so upset. What should I do?

1241
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,150
- Hey. You honestly did nothing.
- My shoulders hurt so much.

1242
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,320
No, that's not true.

1243
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,860
I picked up all the books.

1244
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,860
(So Min did nothing.)

1245
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,280
Hold on.

1246
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:23,990
It was so scary.

1247
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,420
I almost tripped when the old lady
was coming after us. I was scared.

1248
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,990
- It was so scary.
- The door is so scary.

1249
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,360
My voice is gone.

1250
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:38,340
Haha, Se Chan, please go.

1251
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,070
It's completely dark.

1252
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,780
I want to show a new side of me.

1253
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,920
Being too dramatic
on a variety show is...

1254
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,010
actually...

1255
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,150
Haha, will you scream like this?

1256
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,920
No. That's kind of shameful.

1257
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,320
(They set off shamefully.)

1258
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,760
You can't start doing it
at the entrance, Haha.

1259
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,400
I can't see anything.

1260
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,710
How can I go?

1261
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,260
Go to the place where
Chinese characters are written.

1262
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,940
- "Patients?"
- Chinese characters.

1263
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,170
Kick it.

1264
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,670
Here? There must be one here.

1265
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,980
- Right?
- You go first.

1266
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,190
(Shouting)

1267
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,510
You punk.

1268
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,150
- Hey, you.
- Go.

1269
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,320
- You go first.
- Hey.

1270
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,650
- Hey.
- You go first.

1271
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,230
Hey.

1272
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,670
(The cheating instinct took over.)

1273
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,240
As I went in once, you should...

1274
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,400
(Emergency escape)

1275
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,880
- I'm here.
- I'm not doing it.

1276
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,940
- I'm not doing this with this guy.
- All right.

1277
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,240
- He's hopeless.
- Okay.

1278
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,920
He's hopeless.
I'm not doing it with him.

1279
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,380
- Okay.
- I'm not doing this.

1280
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,960
I was looking at you.

1281
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,880
- I quit.
- Okay.

1282
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,400
Seriously. You go first then.

1283
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,460
Okay, I will.

1284
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,360
Are you happy now? Come.

1285
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,690
Come.

1286
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,170
Just walk.

1287
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,360
Keep going.

1288
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,940
Just go.

1289
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,840
Do you know
how good fighters we are?

1290
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,840
- Beat them.
- He was the best in Dongducheon.

1291
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,240
- Bring it on.
- Got it?

1292
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,010
Do you know how scary we are?

1293
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,570
(Screaming)

1294
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:26,820
I'm sorry.

1295
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,820
(A quick apology)

1296
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,990
I'm sorry.

1297
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:34,760
Put candles.

1298
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,780
- Sorry?
- Sorry?

1299
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,420
Candles.

1300
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,690
(They listen well.)

1301
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,690
I'm so scared.

1302
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,740
What? Why?

1303
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,630
(They're startled just by the sound
of the door opening.)

1304
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,260
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1305
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,210
Where are the coins and my book?
I need to find them.

1306
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,280
My neck hurts. I'm sorry,
but you're human, right?

1307
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:01,240
We're looking for books.
Can you find them for us, please?

1308
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,650
- She told me to go out.
- I'm sorry.

1309
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:04,690
My neck hurts.

1310
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,760
It's because I'm so scared.

1311
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,780
- You do it.
- I'll do it. Let's do this quickly.

1312
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,300
What's there to be scared of?

1313
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,820
- Darn it.
- You darn...

1314
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,570
Why?

1315
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,090
(The door closed behind their back.)

1316
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,360
My neck.

1317
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,570
Just pass by. Go.

1318
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,670
(Shouting)

1319
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:24,800
(Screaming)

1320
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,380
(Crying out)

1321
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,650
(They're passing by quickly,
screaming shamefully.)

1322
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,920
Come here.

1323
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,460
(They got to the next room.)

1324
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,710
What's the matter?

1325
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,490
- I want to poop. Why?
- Oh, gosh.

1326
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,730
Why? What is it?
What's the matter, Se Chan?

1327
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,800
- You go first.
- Why, Se Chan?

1328
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,230
Wait. I want to poop.

1329
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,030
Hold on. Let me fart once.

1330
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,610
(Darn it!)

1331
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,110
Next to us.

1332
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:58,980
- I saw it too.
- Next to us.

1333
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,740
- I'll go. My goodness.
- Oh, my.

1334
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,610
- Isn't she the kid from earlier?
- Yes, she is.

1335
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,420
- I'm sorry. Let us go.
- Let us pass.

1336
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,110
Please...

1337
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,150
Do you have something in your hand?

1338
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,150
No, she doesn't.

1339
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,460
I'm sorry.

1340
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,380
I can't see. Don't do it.

1341
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,690
- Should we go this way? Hey.
- It's here.

1342
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,090
- It's here.
- Hey.

1343
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,400
(He found a book.)

1344
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,590
Is this not it?

1345
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,440
- Whose is it? Let me see.
- Wait.

1346
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,760
(Book of Fate)

1347
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,460
It says Haha.

1348
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,980
(They found Haha's Book of Fate.)

1349
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,380
Wait for me, Haha.

1350
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,480
Search for your book here.
There must be one.

1351
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,480
- I don't think there is.
- It must be there.

1352
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,340
- What?
- What? Why did you call me?

1353
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,210
- Why did you call me?
- I got a cramp.

1354
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,490
Do I go this way? Where do I go?
Tell me the direction.

1355
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:45,820
- I got a cramp.
- Where do I go?

1356
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,820
Come here.

1357
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,730
Don't do that. I'm sorry.

1358
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,460
I got a cramp.

1359
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,130
I got a cramp.

1360
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:56,130
Haha, wait for me.

1361
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,240
(Another dirty trick)

1362
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,240
Don't leave me.

1363
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,170
Wait for me. Help me find it.

1364
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,300
What's this?

1365
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,670
That was scary.

1366
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,670
- Come here.
- What?

1367
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,980
(What?)

1368
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,980
Come here.

1369
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,010
- What?
- To where?

1370
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,010
(Screaming)

1371
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,010
Gosh.

1372
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,610
(Screaming
as if they're practicing singing)

1373
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,630
That was so scary.

1374
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:22,630
(That was so scary.)

1375
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,860
Se Chan. We have to find yours.

1376
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,170
I've improved though.

1377
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:30,990
Haha. You're wonderful.

1378
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,440
I can't find the coins.

1379
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,070
We still need to find yours.

1380
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,010
I know. Help me find it
or I'm going to die.

1381
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,900
(Screaming)

1382
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,610
I'm sorry. That was darn scary.

1383
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,210
I admit it.

1384
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,110
I almost peed my pants.

1385
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,210
Hurry up and pass me.

1386
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,320
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1387
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,920
- Before I move.
- Hello.

1388
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,920
(She's sitting on
Se Chan's Book of Fate.)

1389
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,920
(He missed it.)

1390
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,960
Where's mine?

1391
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,730
Okay.

1392
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:00,420
- Help me find mine. Where is it?
- I'm trying.

1393
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,030
- Haha. I need to fart.
- Wait.

1394
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,090
- I need to fart.
- Go ahead.

1395
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:05,960
- I farted so much too.
- Are you still here?

1396
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,360
We're moving.

1397
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,070
- I was farting.
- We're going.

1398
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,740
- I was farting.
- Ma'am!

1399
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,110
Ma'am.

1400
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,510
What is it?

1401
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,820
It's moving.

1402
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,420
- What's moving?
- That's moving.

1403
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,710
(Fart booster on)

1404
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,360
(The fart brothers
escape successfully.)

1405
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,420
- Good work.
- I couldn't find mine.

1406
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,150
(However, Se Chan is empty-handed.)

1407
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,960
You should've gone
through the bookshelf.

1408
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,730
What? I couldn't find it.

1409
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,490
You should've gone
through the books.

1410
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,900
- Did you find your book?
- Yes.

1411
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,110
- Did you find yours?
- No.

1412
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,900
Then you have to go back in
and find it.

1413
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,340
Don't be ridiculous.

1414
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,340
(Don't be ridiculous.)

1415
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,980
(He fails to keep calm.)

1416
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,780
- Hey.
- Hold on.

1417
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,190
Don't be ridiculous.
That's nonsense.

1418
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,960
- What did you just say?
- Calm down.

1419
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,920
- Calm down.
- Hey.

1420
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,530
What are you talking about?
Are you telling me to go in there alone?

1421
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,630
By myself?

1422
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,490
He should go alone.

1423
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,130
That's up to you.

1424
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,800
Right? You should go alone.

1425
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,740
- Come here.
- Oh, my goodness.

1426
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,740
You forgot this.

1427
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,740
- Oh, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1428
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,740
- You forgot this.
- Oh, ma'am.

1429
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,880
(Se Chan's Book of Fate)

1430
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,740
Ma'am. Thank you.

1431
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,840
- Thank you so much.
- Bye.

1432
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,740
- This is great.
- Thank you so much.

1433
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,690
Where did you find it?

1434
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:28,990
I was sitting on it.

1435
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:30,110
I see.

1436
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,110
That's cheating.

1437
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:32,420
Good work.

1438
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,880
Here.

1439
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,820
(They all checked their lifespan
in the Book of Fate.)

1440
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,420
- Gosh.
- Sushi.

1441
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,440
Did you all check your lifespan
in the Book of Fate?

1442
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

1443
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,210
Now, let's start the race.

1444
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,240
As soon as your life is up,
you're out and become a ghost.

1445
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,400
(As soon as your life is up,
you're out and become a ghost.)

1446
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,840
Two of the ghosts will...

1447
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,050
receive the penalty sticker today.

1448
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,340
Do your best to survive
as long as you can.

1449
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:04,590
There are two bets
to expand your lifespan.

1450
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:05,880
Okay.

1451
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,420
You can bet your life
as much as you want.

1452
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,860
If you win, your life will expand
as much as you bet.

1453
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,590
If you lose, your life will reduce
as much as you bet.

1454
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,940
(If you lose, your life will reduce
as much as you bet.)

1455
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,130
I see.

1456
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,740
Okay. If you're confident, bet more.

1457
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,030
If the ghost wins the bet,

1458
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:27,800
he can reduce one human's life.

1459
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,240
(If the ghost wins the bet,
he can reduce one human's life.)

1460
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,340
I could lose the bet on purpose.

1461
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,980
(I could lose the bet on purpose.)

1462
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,590
If you lose the bet...

1463
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,490
- I should win, right?
- You have to win to reduce it.

1464
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,590
(He doesn't understand the rule
even after becoming a ghost.)

1465
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,150
You should just rest today...

1466
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:43,960
in the nearby grave.

1467
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,130
Leave the game to humans.

1468
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,320
- Right.
- Go to a nearby grave,

1469
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,920
- Go for a walk.
- and take a break.

1470
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,740
Fine. I'll reduce your lifespan.

1471
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,110
I'll reduce yours. Just wait.

1472
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,110
- Okay.
- The more the ghosts,

1473
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,400
the better it is for them.

1474
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,570
- They need to take us with them.
- Yes.

1475
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,610
You should take someone
with a short lifespan.

1476
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,240
- Her.
- Yes.

1477
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,340
- Her?
- Me? Why me?

1478
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,710
Not only the coins are hidden,

1479
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,490
but also a way to end the race...

1480
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,260
- before your life is up.
- Really?

1481
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,360
(There's a way to end the race
before your life is up.)

1482
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,230
(There's a hidden mission
to end the race.)

1483
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,260
You should look carefully.

1484
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,990
I should go for that.

1485
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,090
(What's the secret of today's race?)

1486
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,340
Let's get started.

1487
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,530
Let's go.

1488
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,760
If you don't have much time left,
I'll go pick you up.

1489
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:30,440
Let's stay together.
What do you say?

1490
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,300
- The three of us.
- Are you brave?

1491
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,940
Yes. Let's go.

1492
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,610
Let's go.
We need to find coins, right?

1493
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,510
- Yes.
- We just need to find coins.

1494
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,880
Let's find the coins
and go for the bet.

1495
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,110
- Where do we go?
- I'm so sweaty.

1496
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,210
I'm soaked too.

1497
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:42,880
That's pretty. Let's go over there.

1498
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,150
- We...
- I haven't been there yet.

1499
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,610
- It's pretty.
- So Min. Don't go there.

1500
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,610
- It's pretty.
- Stop.

1501
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,630
(Hushing)

1502
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,420
- Then I'll go this way.
- But it's pretty.

1503
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,590
Wait for me.

1504
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,730
(Screaming)

1505
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,130
(Scared for real)

1506
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,690
Hey!

1507
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,400
I was only rushing to find coins.

1508
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,570
You scared me.

1509
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,780
So, don't go alone. I'm scared.

1510
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,780
I'm scared too.

1511
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,740
I found it.

1512
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,610
(Screaming)

1513
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,610
(Trembling)

1514
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,730
(Falling)

1515
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:27,230
Se Chan. You still found it.

1516
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,030
(It was so hard to get the coin.)

1517
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,740
- Let's go in there.
- The coin.

1518
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,440
Why are you such a coward?

1519
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,710
What's so scary?

1520
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,630
That was frightening.

1521
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,780
I should make you a ghost.

1522
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,010
- Me? Try to recruit me.
- Yes.

1523
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:46,320
I need to recruit you, but I have
a feeling you have a very long life.

1524
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,780
Me? Because I never hesitate
to say what's on my mind.

1525
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,780
(He's never stressed.)

1526
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,780
What's that?

1527
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,860
(At that moment,
Jae Suk spots something.)

1528
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,880
Is something here?

1529
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,990
- Where?
- What's my position?

1530
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,800
- Bet.
- It's the bet.

1531
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,090
Ten coins for ghosts,
seven coins for humans.

1532
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,490
I only have two coins.

1533
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:02,690
Are you going to bet?

1534
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,630
(The price for a bet is 10 coins
for ghosts and 7 coins for humans.)

1535
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,840
I don't have seven coins.

1536
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,340
I don't have ten coins.

1537
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,070
Where can I get ten coins?

1538
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,940
- Hurry up and find them.
- Find them?

1539
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,670
Right. They must be somewhere.

1540
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,340
- I'm scared.
- What's this?

1541
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,670
I want to do it now.

1542
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,010
(Rich Lord Yoo tries to expand
his lifespan now.)

1543
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:23,690
Oh, gosh.

1544
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,690
Someone's here to bet?

1545
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,050
That scared me.

1546
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,150
Listen to the sound I make,

1547
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,320
and guess what it is.

1548
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,690
(1. Happy to take revenge)

1549
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,070
(2. Dumbfounded be dead)

1550
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:36,320
I'll bet ten minutes.

1551
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,490
(3. Happy to meet a human)

1552
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:40,130
(1. Happy to take revenge)

1553
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,760
(2. Dumbfounded be dead)

1554
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,170
(3. Happy to meet a human)

1555
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,570
(4. Looking down on Suk Jin)

1556
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,610
What's the answer?

1557
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,980
(3. Happy to meet a human)

1558
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,340
(4. Looking down on Suk Jin)

1559
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,150
Happy to take revenge. Number one.

1560
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:59,360
(1. Happy to take revenge)

1561
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,360
What a shame. It's wrong.

1562
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,690
What's the answer?

1563
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,230
That was number four.

1564
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,460
- Looking down on Suk Jin.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1565
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,420
(Lord Yoo loses 10 minutes of life.)

1566
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,130
That's ridiculous.

1567
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,960
You can't control your life.

1568
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,030
(After reading the lines
in the script,)

1569
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,710
Bring more coins.

1570
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:17,010
(she leaves.)

1571
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:19,300
Jae Suk. Did you get ripped off?

1572
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,610
It's impossible to win.

1573
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,940
- The bet?
- It doesn't make sense at all.

1574
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,610
- Did you try it?
- I'm going to do it now.

1575
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,610
I can't believe it.

1576
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,210
There are a lot of coins there.

1577
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,210
- Really?
- Yes.

1578
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,510
What's this?

1579
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,090
Suk Jin.
There's the Nine-tailed Fox.

1580
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:37,090
- What the?
- Where are the coins?

1581
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,190
Ms. Fox.

1582
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,130
- Suk Jin.
- Ms. Fox.

1583
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,690
- We're both ghosts.
- You're both ghosts.

1584
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,440
- Can you give me one?
- How should I...

1585
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,530
address her?

1586
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,740
Give me one please.

1587
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,900
- Suk Jin. Come here.
- Yes?

1588
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,240
- What?
- It looks like something's in here.

1589
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,610
It's guaranteed.

1590
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,710
Right? Go check it out.

1591
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,510
How? Do I take my shoes off?

1592
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,590
My goodness.

1593
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,010
It's 100 percent.

1594
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:03,960
- It's...
- Suk Jin.

1595
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:06,010
- Look.
- Something must be there.

1596
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:07,730
(Scared)

1597
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:08,880
It's just a cameraman.

1598
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,130
Anything?

1599
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,360
(They found coins.)

1600
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,490
Gosh.

1601
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,240
- Coins.
- There's nothing in here.

1602
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,840
- Nothing?
- It's empty.

1603
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,710
(Jong Kook lies
and takes the bag himself.)

1604
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:23,300
My goodness.

1605
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,030
There must be fake ones.

1606
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,050
- I...
- Suk Jin. There's one.

1607
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,340
- There's one.
- Where?

1608
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,440
- Money.
- Where?

1609
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,240
(They meet a ghost.)

1610
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,090
(He meets another one
while running away.)

1611
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,130
(Screaming)

1612
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,460
(Screaming)

1613
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,030
(Laughing)

1614
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,420
Why am I surprised to see a ghost?

1615
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,730
You're so fast.

1616
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,240
My shoes.

1617
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,610
Stop it. I'm your colleague.

1618
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,710
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook...)

1619
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,210
(Seizing the ghost with an arm bar)

1620
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,590
Wait. I should take that money.

1621
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,320
Good work.

1622
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,550
I'm so drained.

1623
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,820
Suk Jin.

1624
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,690
I'm a ghost. Why was I surprised?

1625
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,460
They're my colleagues.

1626
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:19,900
There's nothing.

1627
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,920
(Holding onto his heart)

1628
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,490
- I think...
- They're all fake.

1629
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,260
the one the Nine-tailed Fox
is holding is fake.

1630
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,260
Let's close it for other people.

1631
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,360
This place is scary.

1632
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,760
That was scary. My voice is gone.

1633
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,880
(That was scary. My voice is gone.)

1634
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,400
I'm so full. I had too many muffins.

1635
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,440
(Out of context)

1636
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,800
I'm so full.

1637
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,740
I'm so full.

1638
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,090
(Running away for the 2nd time)

1639
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,320
(It's too much work for the heart.)

1640
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,360
I am full. This is driving me crazy.

1641
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,490
- What? Give me some coins.
- What are you doing?

1642
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:56,260
- No. These coins are mine.
- Give me some coins.

1643
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,240
- Give me some coins.
- I need them for plastic surgery.

1644
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,960
- These coins are mine.
- I got more coins. Hold on.

1645
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,570
This is nice. Okay.

1646
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,400
- What?
- It's nothing.

1647
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,240
You got startled, right?

1648
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,050
I got some coins.

1649
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,480
(While the weak ghost walks around
without much gain,)

1650
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,740
(Jae Suk looks for coins
after losing coins in a bet.)

1651
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,740
Gosh!

1652
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,780
(Jae Suk's cameraman
screams as well.)

1653
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,820
Hey.

1654
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,110
Hey, Sung Ho.

1655
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:19,280
(The cameraman ran away.)

1656
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,490
Hey.

1657
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:22,590
How could you get startled?

1658
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,090
(Jae Suk's cameramen
are known to get scared easily.)

59:58,369 --> 01:00:00,340
Now that Kwon Ryeol isn't here,
he is causing me a headache.

1659
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:28,070
(Jae Suk's cameramen
are known to get scared easily.)

1660
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,090
I am stressed out.

1661
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,670
(The cowardly Lord Haha
is looking for white lights.)

1662
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:32,990
I don't want to get a penalty.

1663
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:34,130
(The cowardly Lord Haha
is looking for white lights.)

1664
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,170
My goodness, Suk Jin.

1665
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,280
He passed away...

1666
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,570
and turned into a statue.

1667
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,170
Suk Jin.

1668
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:49,190
I never treated you to a warm meal
while you were alive.

1669
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:52,260
Suk Jin.

1670
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,960
It's scary to imagine
the statue moving.

1671
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,400
(Cowards imagine things
and get scared.)

1672
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,650
Imagine the statue moving.

1673
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,900
I will find coins...

1674
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:02,990
(The old ghost is determined
to shorten the members' lifespans.)

1675
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,400
and shorten people's lifespans.
This won't do.

1676
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,590
(The old ghost is determined
to shorten the members' lifespans.)

1677
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,840
How much time
does Jae Suk have left?

1678
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,240
I will play for 30 minutes
of Jae Suk's life.

1679
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,170
- Thirty minutes of Jae Suk's life.
- Maybe he has 15 minutes left.

1680
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,210
- Understood.
- Yes.

1681
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,240
- The rules are simple.
- What are they?

1682
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,480
- I will take a photo of you.
- Okay.

1683
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,710
While you get your photo taken,

1684
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,380
- keep your facial expression blank.
- I can do that.

1685
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,920
It's easy.

1686
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,110
- I will take a nice photo.
- A blank facial expression.

1687
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:27,780
- A blank facial expression.
- Okay.

1688
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,760
I will take it now.

1689
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,630
One, two, three.

1690
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,570
(Startled)

1691
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,460
For goodness' sake.
This is so annoying.

1692
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,630
Gosh.

1693
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,800
All right. Suk Jin failed.

1694
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,030
It was too scary.

1695
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,150
(He lost his coins and failed.)

1696
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,300
You should have gone easy on me.

1697
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,240
This is so scary.

1698
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,550
(Se Chan walks around by himself.)

1699
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:55,920
How many minutes do I have left?
What time is it now?

1700
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,090
(The current time is 9:20 p.m.)

1701
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,260
What?

1702
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,280
Hold on.

1703
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:07,730
(Se Chan only has 20 minutes left.)

1704
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:12,590
I have 7 or 8 coins.

1705
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,530
(He plans to use his coins
in order to extend his life.)

1706
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,760
I will need to do the mission
and extend my life.

1707
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,900
Where will I find the coins?

1708
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,010
(So Min doesn't have
much time either.)

1709
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,240
I don't have much time left.

1710
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:25,440
Only 20 minutes remain of my life.

1711
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,380
(She needs to collect coins
in order to extend her life!)

1712
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,550
I feel dizzy.

1713
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:30,190
I really feel dizzy.

1714
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:31,590
(She needs to collect coins
in order to extend her life!)

1715
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:33,820
This is bad.

1716
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:37,630
(Meanwhile, Se Chan arrives
at a betting place.)

1717
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,550
(1. Sad to see a ghost
that looks better than her)

1718
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,230
(2. Annoyed because people
keep getting surprised at her face)

1719
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,030
(3. In pain because she fell down
while avoiding the Grim Reaper)

1720
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,590
(4. Touched because the food
at the ancestral rite is very tasty)

1721
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:48,960
Number two, annoyed because people
keep getting surprised at her face.

1722
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,210
It's correct!

1723
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:52,340
(It's correct!)

1724
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,710
It's correct!

1725
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:54,710
(Se Chan succeeded in winning a bet
by guessing the answer.)

1726
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:57,380
You succeeded in extending your life
as you wanted.

1727
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,880
(Se Chan's life got extended
by 30 minutes.)

1728
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,170
Thank goodness I earned time.

1729
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,320
(Se Chan's life got extended
by 30 minutes.)

1730
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,210
Ji Hyo, do you want
to go there together?

1731
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,650
Let's go over there.

1732
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,190
I was so scared.

1733
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:10,800
- Ji Hyo, the two of us...
- Haha, go in there.

1734
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,690
I am too scared to go in.

1735
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,170
We can do it. Let's go.

1736
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,170
I am too scared to go in.

1737
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,170
Okay. I will go in.

1738
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,570
(The entrance with the red light
looks spooky.)

1739
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:24,400
Haha, go in there.
I will look for coins.

1740
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:25,780
Okay.

1741
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,380
(After pretending to be brave,
he stops in front of the gate.)

1742
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:28,880
All right.

1743
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,820
(After parting ways with Haha,
she places a bet with her coins.)

1744
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,010
Here you go.

1745
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:34,940
(After parting ways with Haha,
she places a bet with her coins.)

1746
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,990
What time is it now?

1747
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:38,990
(The current time is 9:35 p.m.)

1748
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,530
(Squeaking)

1749
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:42,820
What a sound.

1750
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,050
(Creeped out)

1751
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:46,490
The sound is so scary.

1752
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,260
Hey!

1753
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,740
Hey!

1754
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,670
(Laughing)

1755
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:55,800
Open the door!

1756
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,610
- For goodness' sake.
- What?

1757
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,840
- You startled me.
- Aren't you a ghost?

1758
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,740
- I am, but things are scary.
- What's wrong with you?

1759
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,380
I don't know.
Why are things so scary?

1760
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,050
Look at them. They are on their way
to get someone.

1761
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:09,380
- Right?
- Someone died.

1762
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,440
They are on their way
to get someone.

1763
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:15,030
(Grim Reapers appeared.)

1764
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,860
- Someone died.
- Who died?

1765
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,090
Hey, Joon Hyun.

1766
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:19,760
Sung Kook.

1767
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,490
You startled me.

1768
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:22,760
(He won a bet and extended his life
by 30 minutes.)

1769
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,490
- Why?
- Let's go.

1770
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:25,990
(But the Grim Reapers came
before 30 minutes passed.)

1771
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:28,260
All right. Go easy on me. It hurts.

1772
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,860
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1773
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,440
It hurts.

1774
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,980
- Se Chan.
- Did you do it?

1775
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,740
- Hurry up and join me.
- Did you reduce my life?

1776
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:35,840
What?

1777
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,380
- Let's join forces.
- I will be back soon.

1778
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,210
Gosh, you startled me.
Don't grab me so hard.

1779
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,650
Se Chan, let's join forces.

1780
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,780
Okay. I will be back soon.

1781
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,050
Okay. Come back soon.

1782
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:47,320
(Did Suk Jin reduce
Se Chan's lifespan?)

1783
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,150
(Se Chan got eliminated at 9:40 p.m.)

1784
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,170
Your life has ended.

1785
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:59,840
(So Min begins to run hurriedly
upon seeing something.)

1786
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:05,010
(Grim Reapers appeared here
as well.)

1787
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:10,780
(So Min extended her life to 10 p.m.)

1788
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,990
(She still has 15 minutes left.)

1789
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:19,990
(Ji Hyo is in the middle of a bet.)

1790
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,990
Grim Reapers are following me.
Save me, Ji Hyo.

1791
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,920
So Min, I need to do ssireum. Wait.

1792
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,550
Ssireum?

1793
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:28,730
Your life has ended. Let's go.

1794
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:30,490
(So Min got caught
amidst Ji Hyo's indifference.)

1795
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:31,690
Ssireum.

1796
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,630
You seem to be out of breath.

1797
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,860
(So Min got eliminated
in a mysterious way as well.)

1798
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,170
I am out.

1799
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:40,510
I have no regrets.

1800
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,550
(Did Suk Jin take out two people?)

1801
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:42,900
It was a nice life.

1802
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,670
Bye.

1803
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:46,480
Let's find some coins.

1804
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,110
(Se Chan came back as a ghost.)

1805
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,510
(Glancing over)

1806
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:52,610
Are there no coins?

1807
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:54,990
My goodness.

1808
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:56,960
You were one tempo late.

1809
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:59,030
Gosh, that hurts.

1810
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:01,360
Do you have any coins?

1811
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:03,170
Help me out!

1812
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,130
Give me coins!

1813
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,030
Help me out!

1814
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,940
My throat is hoarse.
Don't you have any coins?

1815
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,670
I am a fellow ghost.

1816
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,780
Please give me some coins
if you have them.

1817
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,550
I need to turn more people
into ghosts.

1818
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:15,550
(He needs to collect coins
and reduce people's lifespans.)

1819
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,670
I need to hurry up.

1820
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,440
I should go to that lazy ghost
who is lying down.

1821
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,610
Mister.

1822
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,710
Mister.

1823
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,190
Do you have coins?

1824
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:26,780
Do you have coins? No?

1825
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:28,760
You shouldn't sleep here.

1826
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,150
You have coins, right?

1827
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:32,230
It's convenient
now that I am a ghost.

1828
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,190
(The second newbie ghost)

1829
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,400
I look scary, right?

1830
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,170
It's no joke.

1831
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,170
I hope someone sees me.

1832
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,460
(Happy)

1833
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,260
If someone comes...

1834
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,570
(The newbie ghosts
are absorbed in their roles.)

1835
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,110
(The current time is 10:10 p.m.)

1836
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:48,050
Let's play a game.

1837
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:50,820
Cham.

1838
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,840
(Those who place a bet
to extend their lifespans)

1839
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,490
My goodness, are you okay?

1840
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,920
I will extend your life
as you wanted.

1841
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,880
Who is next?

1842
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,690
You need to bet someone's life.

1843
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:04,360
I will play for 30 minutes
of Jae Suk's life.

1844
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,400
Okay.

1845
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:06,990
Thirty minutes of Jae Suk's life.

1846
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,170
I should look for hints.

1847
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,990
Placing bets to extend your lifespan
isn't the answer.

1848
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,780
(While explaining the rules
of the race)

1849
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:18,940
(There is a way to end the race...)

1850
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,740
(before their time runs out.)

1851
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:26,570
(A way to end the race?)

1852
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:29,990
What's this?

1853
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:32,990
(Jae Suk goes in search
of the hidden secret.)

1854
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,260
(At that moment,)

1855
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,800
(he finds
a suspicious-looking book.)

1856
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,130
What's this?

1857
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:46,590
What does this mean?

1858
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:52,630
The Joseon Book of Fate has
records of everyone's lifespan.

1859
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:57,210
The time of everyone's death
is written in this book.

1860
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,240
At that time, Grim Reapers
with five horns go to the person.

1861
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:09,990
In Running Village, there is
a total of three Grim Reapers.

1862
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:12,860
("Veritable Records
of the Joseon Dynasty...")

1863
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:18,360
"In Running Village, there is
a total of three Grim Reapers."

1864
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:23,960
(Three Grim Reapers
are in Running Village.)

1865
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,440
(Glancing over)

1866
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,940
Lord Yoo.

1867
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:32,050
- What...
- It seems like you found something.

1868
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:33,650
- What?
- Why don't you help me?

1869
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:37,240
- What is this about?
- It seems like you found something.

1870
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,690
- What do you mean?
- What's this?

1871
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:43,750
This is... I can't tell you.

1872
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,590
How much do you need?

1873
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,050
(How much do you need?)

1874
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:50,290
What are you doing?

1875
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,370
(Slave Kim joins them.)

1876
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:52,570
Did you find some coins?

1877
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:54,260
I found only one coin at a time.

1878
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,260
I know.

1879
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,670
(Glaring)

1880
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:59,200
- So it has begun.
- I know.

1881
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,340
- This race has a secret, right?
- What do you mean?

1882
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,500
Okay. I get it now.

1883
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,040
- I will get going now.
- Okay.

1884
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,120
(They part ways.)

1885
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,280
Where should I go?

1886
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,990
(Jae Suk takes out the book again
after everyone leaves.)

1887
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:12,210
What does this mean?

1888
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:19,700
"In Running Village, there is
a total of three Grim Reapers."

1889
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:24,630
(Three Grim Reapers?)

1890
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:28,570
(He saw two Grim Reapers earlier.)

1891
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:30,200
Grim Reapers with five horns?

1892
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,440
(Where is
the one remaining Grim Reaper?)

1893
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,450
Does that mean one of us is a ghost?

1894
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:37,670
It means one of us is a ghost.

1895
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:40,040
(Is there another Grim Reaper?)

1896
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,040
I need to collect hints.

1897
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,120
(Lord Yoo becomes careful
upon finding an important hint.)

1898
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,710
I think I can stop having matches.

1899
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:49,120
That isn't what's important
right now.

1900
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,750
I need to end the race.

1901
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:53,120
What's this?

1902
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,330
(He finds a scroll.)

1903
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,290
"Only the Grim Reapers
can eliminate a person..."

1904
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:58,870
"by taking off his or her name tag."

1905
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,160
"If the Grim Reapers eliminate all,
they win."

1906
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,800
"To beat the Grim Reapers,
rip off the name tag of the leader."

1907
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,440
"But if humans suspect each other
and rip off the wrong name tag,"

1908
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,910
"all humans will get eliminated
and the race will end. Be careful."

1909
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:13,650
"Only the Grim Reapers
can eliminate a person."

1910
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:14,750
My goodness.

1911
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,950
Your time has come.

1912
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,490
- I've come for you.
- Me?

1913
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:21,360
If the leader takes off
the last person's name tag,

1914
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,250
the Grim Reapers win.

1915
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,700
(Suk Jin, 8:50 p.m.)

1916
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,790
(Three humans have been eliminated.)

1917
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:32,660
(Se Chan, 9:40 p.m.)

1918
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:36,760
(So Min, 9:45 p.m.)

1919
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:39,080
To beat the Grim Reapers,

1920
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:42,200
rip off the name tag of the leader.

1921
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,510
(To beat the Grim Reapers,
rip off the name tag of the leader.)

1922
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,710
(Jong Kook found a way
to end the race.)

1923
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,820
I knew there would be more
to this race.

1924
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,490
Hold on.

1925
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:54,290
I need to tell people about this.

1926
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:57,490
The Grim Reapers
can take off our name tags.

1927
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:58,530
(Jong Kook sets out
to share the knowledge.)

1928
01:10:58,530 --> 01:10:59,530
Hold on.

1929
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,400
I am sorry.

1930
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,570
- Seriously.
- Haha.

1931
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:05,040
Seriously.

1932
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,240
- Haha.
- Yes?

1933
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:08,570
Come here. Who are you with?
Jae Suk?

1934
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:09,570
Jae Suk.

1935
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,500
- Stop it.
- You found something.

1936
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,440
What is it?

1937
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,870
- You...
- Hold on.

1938
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:16,870
- I don't know what to do.
- Is there something strange?

1939
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,370
You know...

1940
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:19,750
What's that?

1941
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:20,980
What's that?

1942
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,750
(They hesitate to share the hints.)

1943
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,950
- There must be a twist.
- There is more to the race.

1944
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,750
Open up.

1945
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,530
- "Open up?"
- Yes.

1946
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,950
For goodness' sake.

1947
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:32,230
What's that?

1948
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:33,590
What I have is too crucial.

1949
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:35,260
- We don't have much time.
- What I have is too crucial.

1950
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:36,730
What I have is the same.

1951
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,370
Maybe we have the same information.

1952
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,660
Let's see.
I think they are different.

1953
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,610
- Here.
- It's crucial. We are in trouble.

1954
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:43,660
What does it say?

1955
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:46,910
- Here.
- "The Joseon Book of Fate..."

1956
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:49,200
"There is a total
of three Grim Reapers."

1957
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,540
We only saw 2 Grim Reapers,
so that means 1 is among us.

1958
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,490
"Only the Grim Reapers
can eliminate a person."

1959
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:57,410
I need to watch my name tag.

1960
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,990
"If the Grim Reapers eliminate all,
they win."

1961
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:03,120
"To beat the Grim Reapers,
rip off the name tag of the leader."

1962
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,090
"But if humans suspect each other
and rip off the wrong name tag,"

1963
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:07,030
"all humans will get eliminated
and the race will end. Be careful."

1964
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,030
"There is a total
of three Grim Reapers."

1965
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,630
One of the three is the leader.

1966
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:13,590
- We saw two of them.
- Who?

1967
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:15,610
The two who took Suk Jin.

1968
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,980
- Are those the Grim Reapers?
- Yes.

1969
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:19,800
- And...
- And one of them is among us.

1970
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,950
- Thus, there are three.
- There is the leader.

1971
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:23,000
- There is the leader.
- Yes.

1972
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,080
- Hey.
- Right?

1973
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,150
The leader.

1974
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,080
Hey, I am not it.

1975
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,620
- I got him.
- I got him.

1976
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,040
- Hey.
- The leader.

1977
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:32,820
Look. He is flustered.

1978
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:34,920
- He is flustered.
- We caught the leader.

1979
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,030
- Hold on.
- The leader.

1980
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:38,030
- He must be the leader.
- It's fitting.

1981
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:39,290
It's fitting.

1982
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:42,000
- He is flustered.
- He did behave strangely.

1983
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,790
Jong Kook, I am not it.

1984
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:44,870
Sit down.

1985
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,460
(Okay.)

1986
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:48,070
- Sit down.
- I am 100 percent sure.

1987
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,740
Will the race end
if we remove his name tag?

1988
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,110
It will end
if we remove the leader's name tag.

1989
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:53,080
But if he isn't the leader,
all of us will be eliminated.

1990
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,040
You need to think about this.

1991
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,610
Why are you changing the subject?

1992
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:59,320
Listen. There are people
we haven't seen for a while.

1993
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:01,040
You are right.
There are such people.

1994
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,910
It means they could be working
separately...

1995
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:05,510
to eliminate people.

1996
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:06,710
Hold on. How many people remain?

1997
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:08,120
- You, me...
- People got eliminated.

1998
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,880
Ji Hyo is still alive.

1999
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:12,160
Come forward and take the coins.

2000
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,160
(She collected coins diligently.)

2001
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,250
Please give me coins.

2002
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,460
- Thank you.
- Go.

2003
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,830
Thank you.

2004
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,160
Who wants to place a bet?

2005
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,240
It's me.

2006
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,260
(Is Ji Hyo the leader?)

2007
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:24,070
- Here is the important thing.
- We could end the race.

2008
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:25,780
He isn't explaining himself well.

2009
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:27,670
I am not a Grim Reaper.
I am a mantis.

2010
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,450
- What?
- What?

2011
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,620
- I am not a Grim Reaper.
- That wasn't funny at all.

2012
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,620
- I am a mantis.
- That makes no sense.

2013
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,880
The only explanation
is that he is nervous.

2014
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,910
(Jae Suk didn't share his hint
with Haha earlier.)

2015
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:41,250
(Is Jae Suk the leader?)

2016
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,420
Okay. I got it.

2017
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:45,860
- I am serious. I am not it.
- Go and do whatever you want.

2018
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,160
This is driving me crazy.

2019
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,290
"This is driving me crazy."

2020
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,760
Go and do whatever you want.

2021
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,570
- Gosh.
- My lifespan...

2022
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,240
I think he will go
and place a bet...

2023
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,330
to reduce my lifespan by 30 minutes.

2024
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,740
This is driving me crazy.
They are suspecting me.

2025
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:58,940
(Jae Suk leaves.)

2026
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,130
Haha, we can't take off his name tag
if we become ghosts.

2027
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:04,340
We should extend our lifespans.
Let's place bets.

2028
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,910
Jong Kook, come here.
Let's go together.

2029
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:07,450
- We need to place bets.
- I was so startled.

2030
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:08,620
What time is it now?

2031
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,820
I don't have much time left.

2032
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:13,050
I don't have much time left.

2033
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,050
This is bad.

2034
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:16,920
I will place a bet.

2035
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,250
Hey, zombies.

2036
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,000
I brought water.

2037
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,500
Drink some water.

2038
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,700
Drink some water.
Here. Take a bottle.

2039
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:24,830
(This ghost is selling water.)

2040
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:26,940
Here is water. Thank you.

2041
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,240
Thank you.

2042
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:30,660
(Screaming)

2043
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,300
Give me a bottle of water.

2044
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,410
Are you a water ghost?
Why are you carrying water?

2045
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:35,700
Give me a coin.

2046
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,040
(Smacking)

2047
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,250
(The vendor ghost
gets a smack on the head.)

2048
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,010
- Hey.
- Give me a bottle of water.

2049
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,080
What's that?

2050
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,210
We are in trouble.

2051
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:44,290
Why?

2052
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:46,290
- Is there a spy?
- It's Jae Suk.

2053
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:47,550
- I think it's Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk?

2054
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:48,860
What's going on? Tell me.

2055
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,790
- Well...
- Just sell water.

2056
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,230
- Why? What's going on?
- Water vendor.

2057
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,590
What's going on?

2058
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:55,900
I did the blank expression mission.

2059
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,460
- Keep your distance.
- Why?

2060
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:58,870
You might be the leader.

2061
01:14:58,870 --> 01:14:59,940
Jong Kook.

2062
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:01,740
Rip off my name tag then.

2063
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,260
I can't do that. What?

2064
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:04,330
I think they are here for me.

2065
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:06,080
(Two Grim Reapers approach them.)

2066
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,110
Haha is out.

2067
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:08,150
No way.

2068
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:10,910
- We are here to drink water.
- I see.

2069
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:12,620
Thank you for your hard work.

2070
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,650
Jong Kook!

2071
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,150
Get him!

2072
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:16,510
- Your life has ended.
- For goodness' sake.

2073
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:17,580
- Let's go.
- Hey.

2074
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,210
- It isn't me.
- Take the scroll.

2075
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:20,210
Take the scroll, you punk.

2076
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:21,530
(Jong Kook gets eliminated as well.)

2077
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:23,120
My time isn't up yet.

2078
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,860
It seems like
someone reduced my lifespan.

2079
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:29,290
It's him!

2080
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:30,590
It's Jae Suk!

2081
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:34,240
(Jae Suk appeared
before Jong Kook.)

2082
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,440
The Grim Reapers have five horns.

2083
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,540
- It's Jae Suk!
- You are mistaken.

2084
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,410
(He is unfazed
by Jong Kook's elimination.)

2085
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,370
- It's Jae Suk!
- What's happening?

2086
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:43,580
It's Jae Suk.

2087
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,780
- Tell me what the race is about.
- Suk Jin.

2088
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:48,620
I think Jae Suk is the leader
among the Grim Reapers.

2089
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,150
- Is there such a thing?
- Yes.

2090
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,550
(A Grim Reaper eliminated people
from Suk Jin to Jong Kook.)

2091
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:58,030
(Suk Jin, Se Chan,
So Min, Jong Kook)

2092
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:00,950
The leader is
among the surviving members.

2093
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:03,290
(The leader is
among the surviving members.)

2094
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:08,440
To beat the Grim Reapers,
rip off the name tag of the leader.

2095
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,780
- Tell me what the race is about.
- Suk Jin.

2096
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:14,480
I think Jae Suk is the leader
among the Grim Reapers.

2097
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,080
- Is there such a thing?
- Yes.

2098
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,540
Why doesn't he think it's me?

2099
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,010
Edit this part to make things
more confusing.

2100
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,550
I was speaking nonsense.

2101
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:30,050
(This ghost wants more screen time.)

2102
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:31,120
Hey.

2103
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,290
You know that there is
a Grim Reaper among us, right?

2104
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:35,830
Yes, I do.

2105
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:38,130
It isn't me.

2106
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,260
- Is it you?
- It isn't me.

2107
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,160
- Who is it then?
- That's what we need to find out.

2108
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:44,260
What's the story?

2109
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:45,800
It's not like that.

2110
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:48,580
- What's the story?
- Suk Jin.

2111
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,300
He says there is
a leader of the Grim Reapers.

2112
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,620
What's going on?

2113
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,150
There must be more hints.

2114
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,320
- You little...
- You startled me!

2115
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,380
For goodness' sake.

2116
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:02,620
(You little...)

2117
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:04,250
For goodness' sake.

2118
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,120
(An old lady stops Jae Suk
at the gate.)

2119
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,660
Are you a human or a Grim Reaper?

2120
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,830
I am a human.

2121
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:12,940
A Grim Reaper can't enter a place
that has deer antler,

2122
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,300
fox head, and pig tooth.

2123
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,240
What?

2124
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:20,540
Deer antler,
fox head, and pig tooth?

2125
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:24,500
A Grim Reaper can't enter a place
that has deer antler,

2126
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,080
fox head, and pig tooth.

2127
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,450
(Grim Reapers dislike deer antler,
fox head, and pig tooth.)

2128
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:34,120
(They can't enter a place
with these items.)

2129
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,360
I have no problems.

2130
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:39,120
- Are you a human?
- Yes, I am.

2131
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:50,300
- Are you a human?
- Yes, I am.

2132
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,430
Enter.

2133
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:52,840
I...

2134
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,380
(Jae Suk got past the gate.)

2135
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:59,790
(Jae Suk is a human,
not a Grim Reaper.)

2136
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,680
She is an incredible actor.

2137
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,790
(Aristocrat's House)

2138
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:06,180
A Grim Reaper
can't enter this place.

2139
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,060
Then I just need to bring them here.

2140
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:20,300
(Jae Suk decides to bring
the remaining members.)

2141
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,800
Then I just need to bring them here.

2142
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,410
Hey.

2143
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:25,710
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2144
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:26,770
Hey.

2145
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,510
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Haha.

2146
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:29,810
- Jae Suk.
- What is it?

2147
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,420
- Come here.
- Why?

2148
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,990
What is it?

2149
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,420
- There are rumors about you.
- You know,

2150
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,660
(The members come
to the shrine gate.)

2151
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,590
- An old lady told me this.
- Okay.

2152
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,920
The Grim Reaper
can't get through the door.

2153
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,960
(The Grim Reaper
can't get through the door.)

2154
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:41,990
What?

2155
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,460
Do you know what I mean?

2156
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,670
- Try going in there.
- The Grim Reaper can't go in?

2157
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:47,020
The Grim Reaper can't go in there.

2158
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,060
You should try going in.

2159
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,390
The Grim Reaper can't go in?

2160
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:50,760
The Grim Reaper can't go in there.

2161
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,600
- You should try going in.
- It's a false rumor.

2162
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,260
- No.
- It is a false rumor.

2163
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,370
- Hello.
- Come here.

2164
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:57,130
- Is that what she said?
- Come here.

2165
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:58,170
Ma'am, come over here.

2166
01:18:58,170 --> 01:18:59,170
- You come here.
- Did you really say that?

2167
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:00,580
If he can't go through the door,
he's the Grim Reaper.

2168
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:01,970
- Go ahead and get through it.
- I can go in.

2169
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,170
But this is a lie.

2170
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:04,770
- Come on in.
- You should be able to go in.

2171
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:06,380
- Come in.
- Of course I can go in.

2172
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,120
- Go ahead and come on in.
- I'm going in now.

2173
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:10,660
I'm going in now.

2174
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,660
(But Haha stops on the threshold.)

2175
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,550
- I can go in.
- Go further in.

2176
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,890
- I can.
- Come on in.

2177
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,160
See? He wants to rip off my name tag
once I go in there.

2178
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,350
No, I won't rip it off.

2179
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:24,390
(Haha keeps stopping
in front of the door.)

2180
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:25,590
No, I won't rip it off.

2181
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,170
Come in with the ghosts.

2182
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:28,960
- Come here.
- You can come with them.

2183
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,380
(Right at the moment...)

2184
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:34,140
(Haha goes in.)

2185
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:36,250
You can come with them.

2186
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,010
The lady said
the Grim Reaper can't come in here.

2187
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:42,350
(That means
I'm not the Grim Reaper.)

2188
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:43,880
That means I'm not the Grim Reaper.

2189
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,760
Then it's Song Ji Hyo.

2190
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,630
(Then it's Song Ji Hyo.)

2191
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:51,760
Is Ji Hyo the Grim Reaper?

2192
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,520
(Is Ji Hyo the Grim Reaper?)

2193
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,930
The Grim Reaper can't come in here?

2194
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:58,370
Ji Hyo... I mean,
did the old lady say that?

2195
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:00,170
You and I are the only ones alive.

2196
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:01,460
Did Ji Hyo die?

2197
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:02,670
You're out once you become a ghost.

2198
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:04,630
Actually, I didn't see Ji Hyo here.

2199
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:05,950
I don't see her here.

2200
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:07,950
Find Ji Hyo.

2201
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:10,810
She's probably doing her mission.

2202
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,380
Where's Ji Hyo?

2203
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,490
Ji Hyo is the Grim Reaper.

2204
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:16,090
She must be the Grim Reaper.

2205
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:18,260
Gosh, it's Ji Hyo.

2206
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,260
Is that Ji Hyo? Go find Ji Hyo.

2207
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:22,330
Otherwise, we will be out,
and the race will be over.

2208
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:24,760
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

2209
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,560
So Min, hurry and come here.
Suk Jin.

2210
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,920
Ji Hyo has horns on her head.

2211
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:31,000
Otherwise, we will be eliminated.

2212
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,210
(The Grim Reaper, Song Ji Hyo)

2213
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:37,580
(This morning)

2214
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:42,770
(The 3 Grim Reapers are here to take
people's lives in Running Village.)

2215
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:47,750
That means there is a ghost
among us.

2216
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:52,990
(Song Ji Hyo, the Grim Reaper leader
is in Running Village.)

2217
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:57,520
(The Grim Reaper's goal is
to eliminate all the humans.)

2218
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,370
(The card reading said
night brings her good luck.)

2219
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:05,170
(And she's like a night owl.)

2220
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:10,580
(As the night glides on, she starts
looking for the Book of Fate.)

2221
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:11,970
Yoo Jae Suk.

2222
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:17,310
(Ji Hyo's Book of Fate had
the lifespans of humans.)

2223
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:20,950
(Ji Hyo could reduce the lifespans
of humans with bets as a ghost.)

2224
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:23,510
(She started the bet
by shortening Se Chan's life.)

2225
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:25,850
(Se Chan: 10:10 p.m.)

2226
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:28,830
(Se Chan: 9:40 p.m.)

2227
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:33,300
(That's why Se Chan got
eliminated 30 minutes early.)

2228
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,260
(The Grim Reaper's
second target is Jong Kook.)

2229
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,560
(Yang Se Chan 30 minutes,
Kim Jong Kook 30 minutes)

2230
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,740
(That's how she shortened
their lives and eliminated them.)

2231
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:46,750
(When she reached the entrance
to the shrine with Haha,)

2232
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:51,120
(The Grim Reaper was too scared
to go in there.)

2233
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:53,450
Okay. I'll show you how I go in.

2234
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:57,290
(Ji Hyo left the place
saying she'd look for coins.)

2235
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:00,990
(And there was a hint
that the humans missed.)

2236
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:05,550
(Ji Hyo's portraits were
tied up to a tree in the shrine.)

2237
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:10,130
(That's how the Grim Reaper was
taking human lives.)

2238
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:16,770
(The only humans who can stop
the Grim Reaper, Jae Suk and Haha)

2239
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:22,100
(It's 10:50 p.m. now.
Haha's life will end soon.)

2240
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:24,170
Don't be ridiculous.

2241
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:25,380
The ghosts are coming.

2242
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:28,450
(Right at the moment...)

2243
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:35,760
(The ghosts are rushing
to the entrance of the shrine.)

2244
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:38,460
Let us in!

2245
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,370
(The ghosts are
blocking the entrance.)

2246
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:43,040
- Let us in!
- Help us.

2247
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:44,670
What?

2248
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:46,040
- The Grim Reaper.
- There's...

2249
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,210
(They see someone
behind the ghosts.)

2250
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:48,760
That's the Grim Reaper.

2251
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,510
- Let us in!
- What?

2252
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:51,630
They can't get in here.

2253
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,010
They can't come in.

2254
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:54,470
Where's Ji Hyo?

2255
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,080
Where's Ji Hyo?

2256
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:58,340
I don't know!

2257
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:01,210
- Where is Song Ji Hyo?
- I don't know!

2258
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,290
Move over.

2259
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:09,960
(The Grim Reaper leader shows up
when the ghosts are gathered.)

2260
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,850
Move over.

2261
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:12,870
(The Grim Reaper leader shows up
when the ghosts are gathered.)

2262
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:14,460
It's done. There's Ji Hyo.

2263
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,870
- Ji Hyo.
- Yoo Jae Suk, Haha.

2264
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:18,260
(Yoo Jae Suk and Haha,
your lives are over. Come on out.)

2265
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:20,130
Your lives are over. Come on out.

2266
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:21,300
It's over.

2267
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:24,080
Come on out. Come here.

2268
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:26,210
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Come here.

2269
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,100
- Leader.
- I'm the leader...

2270
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,580
- of the Grim Reapers.
- Leader.

2271
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:32,420
- I'm the leader.
- Once the Grim Reaper rips off...

2272
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:35,920
the name tags of the humans,
the Grim Reaper wins.

2273
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:39,050
I don't have much time left.
I increased it a little though.

2274
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,380
It's one between the two.

2275
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:42,630
- We should... Hey, leader.
- We have to go out.

2276
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:43,760
Go ahead and rip it.

2277
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,920
Go and rip it off.

2278
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,560
- Come on out.
- Come in here.

2279
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,960
Just come out here.

2280
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:50,740
Come on out before
you run out of time and die.

2281
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:52,260
Hurry and come.

2282
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,910
Do you want to die
when the time is up?

2283
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:55,910
I know we will die
once the time is up.

2284
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:58,540
- Hurry and come on out.
- Go and try holding her hand.

2285
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:01,970
You two will have to go at her
and see who wins.

2286
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:04,810
Hold your name tags tight.

2287
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:06,180
Be careful.

2288
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,880
Or just stall for time so they will
run out of time and die.

2289
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:15,720
(At the moment...)

2290
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,160
(The two Grim Reapers try
to drag the humans out.)

2291
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,960
They're caught.

2292
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,420
- They are being dragged.
- Go.

2293
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:22,870
They're caught.

2294
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:25,040
(They are dragged out!)

2295
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,540
Ji Hyo, be careful.

2296
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,270
(Ji Hyo takes the chance
and attacks them.)

2297
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,750
- Hang on.
- They hold them for her.

2298
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:35,140
- Gosh, that's tough.
- Wait.

2299
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:37,270
- The Grim Reapers are strong.
- Go get them!

2300
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:38,640
I can't get off of it.

2301
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,290
(Ji Hyo has to rip off
the humans' name tags.)

2302
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:45,510
They are really strong.

2303
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,660
(At that moment, Jae Suk
and Ji Hyo grab each other.)

2304
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:51,660
No.

2305
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,170
No.

2306
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,040
- I took it off.
- My gosh.

2307
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,390
- He took it off.
- He did it.

2308
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,460
No.

2309
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:01,740
- I took it off.
- He did it.

2310
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:02,740
(Song Ji Hyo)

2311
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:04,270
(Song Ji Hyo,
the Grim Reaper is out.)

2312
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:06,050
- Did you rip it?
- Ji Hyo, are you all right?

2313
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:07,470
Ji Hyo lost her name tag.

2314
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:08,470
- Is it over?
- Are you okay, Ji Hyo?

2315
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,380
- Yes, I'm fine.
- The humans win.

2316
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,950
- He took it off.
- He did it.

2317
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:14,250
It says the Grim Reaper.

2318
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,350
What were you two doing?

2319
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:17,880
- No, I tripped.
- We did it.

2320
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,760
- Ji Hyo, are you okay?
- Yes.

2321
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,760
You lost, but you fought well.

2322
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,720
It says the Grim Reaper here.

2323
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,170
All right.

2324
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:28,170
The two humans won't get a penalty.

2325
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:32,170
The first episode of
Whatever Penalty Project,

2326
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,260
- Ghostly War of Coins is over.
- My goodness.

2327
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:36,080
- I'll get a penalty today.
- That was the best one ever.

2328
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,740
The Grim Reaper leader
who shortened human lives today...

2329
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,970
- was Song Ji Hyo.
- My gosh.

2330
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:42,840
- I had no idea.
- Hey, you...

2331
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,140
- She's so cool.
- Why did you eliminate me so soon?

2332
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,490
I didn't see her make a bet.

2333
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:47,680
You just died.

2334
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:48,810
I just died myself?

2335
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:51,550
- You started with a short life.
- I see.

2336
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,850
Since the Grim Reaper lost,

2337
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,550
the humans who eliminated
the Grim Reaper at the end...

2338
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:58,160
won the race.

2339
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:59,760
So Song Ji Hyo, the Grim Reaper...

2340
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,560
and one of the ghosts
will get penalty stickers.

2341
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,560
Okay.

2342
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,040
The member who will get
penalty stickers with Ji Hyo is...

2343
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,670
We have a penalty box.
Ji Hyo will draw a name.

2344
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:10,670
Me?

2345
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:12,540
- Right. The humans...
- I hope it won't be me.

2346
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,670
- The humans survived.
- This is the worst.

2347
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:15,910
- I hope she doesn't pick me.
- Hey.

2348
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:17,710
It will be the worst
if your name gets picked here.

2349
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,420
- Who's picking it?
- Ji Hyo will get a penalty sticker.

2350
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:21,380
- Ji Hyo.
- Shall we let the humans pick it?

2351
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:23,050
- Let the humans pick it.
- Whoever wants to do it.

2352
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:24,050
All right.

2353
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:26,660
Jae Suk, mix them well.
Don't go with your first choice.

2354
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,090
I got one.

2355
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:31,850
(The first penalty sticker
from Whatever Penalty Project)

2356
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,200
- Who is it?
- One name won't leave my hand.

2357
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,200
Okay.

2358
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,370
(The first gate
to the horrible penalty)

2359
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:39,040
- It won't leave your hand?
- No.

2360
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,040
Okay.

2361
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:44,580
(Who will get
the first penalty sticker?)

2362
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,550
- Let me see.
- That's strange.

2363
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:48,910
- This name won't leave my hand.
- It won't?

2364
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,170
- Let me see.
- That's strange.

2365
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:51,970
- I hope it's not me.
- This name...

2366
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:53,490
stuck to my hand the whole time.

2367
01:26:53,490 --> 01:26:54,490
You act like it's one of us.

2368
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:56,460
- I wonder who it is.
- It's strange.

2369
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,620
It's Kim Jong Kook.

2370
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:59,180
My goodness. What's that?

2371
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,660
- I wonder who it is.
- It's strange.

2372
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:04,520
(Kim Jong Kook gets
the penalty sticker.)

2373
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,370
- It's strange.
- It's Kim Jong Kook.

2374
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:08,960
- My goodness. What's that?
- I knew it.

2375
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,560
- You saw the name, right?
- No, I didn't.

2376
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,170
- I think you did.
- I didn't.

2377
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:15,630
Didn't you pray to the three stones
at the shrine earlier?

2378
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:16,910
- What do you mean?
- Did you even pray?

2379
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:19,170
I heard it would bring me good luck.

2380
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:21,580
So I stacked three stones
and prayed to them.

2381
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,140
Isn't it that you prayed
in the wrong way?

2382
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:25,340
Jong Kook doesn't seem that way,
but he's quite superstitious.

2383
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:27,310
- Congratulations.
- He's with Ji Hyo.

2384
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:29,380
- Okay.
- You two are going together.

2385
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:32,760
- Ji Hyo and...
- You're coming with me.

2386
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,760
You two look great together.

2387
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,720
- Good work.
- Good work today.

2388
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,260
- Good work.
- Thank you.

2389
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:40,560
The ghosts did a great job today.

2390
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:43,260
(What's the comment
that makes your heart flutter?)

2391
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:44,740
(I like your t-shirt.)

2392
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:45,740
(Cutie)

2393
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:47,130
(You're driving me crazy.)

2394
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:48,760
(Why are you so cute?)

2395
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:50,880
(You might feel like
some trivial things bother you.)

2396
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,080
(Have confidence in yourself.)

2397
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,100
(Be my girlfriend.)

2398
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,170
(That makes me sick.)

2399
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:56,310
(It's something
a man in his 40s would say.)

2400
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:57,310
(I can't believe them.)

2401
01:27:57,670 --> 01:28:00,250
(They have to get votes
from the citizens.)

2402
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:03,960
(A heated debate on dating
and generational conflicts)

2403
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:05,880
(Am I more like
a friend or an uncle?)

2404
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,660
(They receive real-time feedback.)

2405
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,200
(And there are 7 penalty stickers.)

2406
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,370
(It's a probability game where
only one member can get them all.)

2407
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,870
(They have to stop the penalty
from coming to them.)

2408
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,840
(Who is the member
with the worst luck?)

2409
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:21,800
(Running Man Round and Around)
