1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,230
It's rather cool today, right?

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,970
Yes. The heat let up.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,880
It's cool and refreshing.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,010
Hello

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,550
(A girl with black hair
shows up humming.)

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,380
I dyed my hair. What do you think?

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,380
(A girl with black hair
shows up humming.)

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,910
- I wanted to change my image.
- Hello.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,420
Hello.

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,920
(Se Chan shows up
with the chirpings of cicada.)

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,220
As soon as I get here, the sound...

12
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,490
- I know. The cicada sings.
- It starts chirping.

13
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,490
Hello.

14
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,690
- Ji Hyo looks so cute today, right?
- Ji Hyo, what's with your outfit?

15
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,490
She looks lovely today.
A funky girl.

16
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,690
Why are you guys so skinny?

17
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,490
- She lost a lot of weight.
- I know.

18
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,830
Omicron.

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,370
What? Did you catch the omicron?

20
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,040
I caught the omicron.

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,040
- When?
- When?

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,040
What?

23
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,400
I thought she meant
that she just caught it.

24
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,440
So Min and I caught it together.

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,820
- What Ji Hyo got was the omicron.
- It was a long time ago.

26
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,410
You mean the thing
from a long time ago?

27
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,940
- Yes. When I was ill.
- I see. It was a long time ago.

28
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,410
- He keeps his distance.
- Okay.

29
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,410
- I can't believe So Min.
- Look at him.

30
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,790
- Why?
- They say they like the shirt...

31
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,080
- I wore earlier.
- It looked good.

32
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,930
- I like what you were wearing.
- Why did you get changed?

33
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,430
- No.
- It was pretty, right?

34
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,520
Jong Kook says
what I was wearing is better.

35
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,020
- Because of you...
- This is so banal.

36
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,500
You should ask Jae Suk.
This is a lot better.

37
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,860
He looked like
a retired chairman earlier.

38
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,440
This is weird. He looks
like an elementary kid.

39
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,340
- You looked younger earlier.
- Don't you think so?

40
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,230
- Now you look like Mr. Color Paper.
- I know.

41
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,900
- Mr. Booger.
- Actually,

42
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,750
the highlight of today is Jae Suk.

43
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,840
- Why?
- Jae Suk is...

44
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,580
dressed like a grandma.

45
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,920
Honestly, I tried to hold it back.

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,720
- I wanted him to wear it.
- Right?

47
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,890
- Why isn't he coming?
- He looks like a grandma.

48
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,590
I thought he was my grandma.

49
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,730
Don't let him get changed.

50
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Grandma is finally coming.

51
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,700
- Grandma is here.
- He got changed.

52
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,090
- No.
- No, he didn't.

53
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,120
- Why would you say that?
- Forgetting

54
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,230
(They are ready
to greet the grandma politely.)

55
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,200
They said I looked
like a grandma, right?

56
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,440
I don't agree.

57
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,640
- Look at him.
- You look like a grandma.

58
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,750
- He thinks we're making fun of him.
- I don't agree.

59
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,340
- Mother.
- Grandma.

60
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,640
- What?
- Mother!

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,220
I don't care.
So Min mentioned it earlier,

62
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,810
but I didn't quite agree.

63
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,250
- On purpose...
- I'm not ashamed at all.

64
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,720
- A grandma's cardigan.
- You pretend to be fine, right?

65
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,120
- No.
- Do something with the pimple.

66
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,330
- So Min is upset.
- She failed to attack him.

67
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,150
- He doesn't want me to like it.
- So Min.

68
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,830
Are you wearing a towel?

69
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,520
That's what you wear
when you put your makeup on.

70
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,170
Honestly, this isn't the main theme.

71
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,170
- I...
- Why?

72
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,640
When I watched
"My Little Old Boy" yesterday...

73
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
- Why?
- What about it?

74
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,860
- Jong Kook?
- You were on the show shirtless.

75
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,230
- It's not like that.
- I couldn't believe it.

76
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,010
(Jong Kook took his shirt off
on "My Little Old Boy.")

77
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,510
(He was on the show shirtless
when he was just in a kids' pool.)

78
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,740
You take off your shirts
on every show, but not ours.

79
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,210
I was very disappointed.

80
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,210
He never does that on our show.

81
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,790
He shows his nipples on other shows.

82
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,680
- He's...
- All nipples.

83
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,230
What I liked about him was
that he had modest muscles.

84
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,730
I also had modest muscles that day.

85
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,170
He always tried to cover his body.

86
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,540
- But he took off his shirt there.
- But...

87
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,910
And he even put something
on his body.

88
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,170
- All over his body.
- Here's the thing.

89
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,080
I often take off my shirt
on my channel.

90
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,350
It's ironic that I never
take it off on other shows.

91
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,550
- Then take it off here.
- What about our show?

92
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,770
A lot of kids watch this show.
"My Little Old Boy" airs late at night.

93
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,210
Take off your shirt on our show too.

94
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,610
Why would I take it off?

95
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,850
He needs a reason.

96
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,420
- He doesn't need a reason.
- It's not like that.

97
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,580
What's wrong about taking off
a shirt at a swimming pool?

98
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,360
- Let's go to a swimming pool.
- It's strange to take it off here.

99
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,990
It was just
a small inground liner pool.

100
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,890
- Anyway, it was...
- He just had some water.

101
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,140
- All we need is water.
- I had to go into the water.

102
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,960
Then show
your lower body on our show.

103
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,170
Hey.

104
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,540
This show is for those above age 15.
What are you wearing?

105
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,610
- Haha.
- What's wrong with this?

106
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,610
- Why?
- You can't wear that here.

107
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,550
- What's that?
- What's wrong about this?

108
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,110
- What's that?
- What's wrong with you?

109
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,510
Have you not kissed at all?

110
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,510
Dream will be watching this.
Do you not mind it at all?

111
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,010
- What's wrong with this?
- This isn't just a kiss.

112
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,360
- Not just a kiss.
- We should blur it.

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,610
This is not right.

114
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,790
All our outfits are a mess.

115
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,730
- Doesn't he have another shirt?
- It's a mess.

116
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,420
- They are naked.
- This shirt is not right.

117
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,520
This is just fine.

118
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,730
- That's not fine.
- It's not right.

119
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,260
- Pull yourself together.
- We should blur it.

120
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,540
Get a grip.

121
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,110
Get me something.

122
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,170
- I'll do this.
- I need scissors. I'll cut it off.

123
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,330
- But we're...
- Young Jin!

124
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,800
We're being too strict
to one another now.

125
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,240
No, this is not acceptable.

126
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,170
This is just fine.

127
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,350
By the way, Ji Hyo's outfit
is the best I've seen this year.

128
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,420
- She looks lovely today.
- Ji Hyo is...

129
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,950
You can't wear a shirt
with skulls on it around Suk Jin.

130
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,110
What are you talking about?

131
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,790
What's wrong with that?

132
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,960
- He will soon become a skull.
- Me?

133
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,900
- What do I have to do with skulls?
- Hey.

134
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,360
You can't wear that
when you're with Suk Jin.

135
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,060
- Cover it.
- I have nothing to do with skulls.

136
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,430
- You should cover it.
- It's fine.

137
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,040
- He will soon become a skull.
- No.

138
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,400
- Pull yourself together.
- Right.

139
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,910
We never know who will die first.

140
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,210
- So Min.
- My goodness.

141
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,170
- So Min dyed her hair.
- That's right. I did.

142
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,570
I like your hair, So Min.

143
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,780
- Well done.
- I dyed my hair.

144
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,070
He does sound like a grandma
who nags a lot.

145
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,110
- I like her hair. What?
- Good.

146
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,790
There are a lot of grandmas
who are nice and kind.

147
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,480
Are you trying to belittle grandmas?

148
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,880
- That's a hasty generalization.
- Apologize.

149
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,360
- Hey! Get lost!
- Hey.

150
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,920
- Everything we say...
- Grandmas are...

151
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,050
Whatever we say, it's belittlement.

152
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,190
- Not all grandmas nag a lot.
- Seriously?

153
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,160
- My mom is a grandma too.
- Hey.

154
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,690
And my mom is a grandma too.

155
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,300
What about my mom?
She's a grandma too!

156
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,860
- Hey.
- And my mom nags a lot.

157
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,300
How could you say that
about grandmas in Korea?

158
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,930
(This is how the members
of Running Man attack each other.)

159
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,170
Today is Monday.

160
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,930
- We're being sensitive.
- Seriously...

161
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,340
- Se Chan looks good today.
- Why?

162
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,280
- He lost weight.
- Right.

163
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,520
- I lost 1kg.
- I knew it. I could tell.

164
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,740
When he loses weight,
his jaw area becomes slim.

165
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,090
Right. So my mouth
sticks out even more.

166
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,220
- I know.
- It's better when I'm fat.

167
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,530
We have some news to share.

168
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,680
- What is it?
- What?

169
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,690
For Korea's most
influential celebrity...

170
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,550
- Why would you say that?
- He was ranked number one.

171
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,120
- My goodness.
- It's Yoo Jae Suk.

172
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,990
- Number two is BTS.
- My gosh.

173
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,630
- Thank you.
- He's the most influential figure.

174
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,980
- I mean...
- I saw that too. He won...

175
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,480
over 70 percent.

176
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,870
I was greatly influenced by him.

177
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,870
Thank you. This is just...

178
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,050
Honestly,
I don't study others' faces,

179
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,170
but I do study his.

180
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,740
- Is it an influence?
- Yes, it is.

181
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,940
Jong Kook does.

182
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,220
He's the only celebrity...

183
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,880
- I walk on eggshells around.
- He does mind me.

184
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,750
Jong Kook does mind my feelings.

185
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,750
Look at me.

186
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,480
(Look at me.)

187
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,120
- This is what I do.
- He's 44.

188
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,100
I think this is just fine.

189
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,100
- Hey.
- Well done.

190
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,860
This is where you should put it.

191
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,710
- He's 44.
- What are you doing?

192
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,170
That's right. This is nice.

193
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,710
- It looks nice.
- I told him something earlier.

194
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,300
I told him to grow his hair.

195
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,350
- I know.
- My gosh.

196
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,110
I'll grow my hair
starting on November 1.

197
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,310
- He should grow his hair.
- If you have your hair cut short,

198
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,480
it should look good on you.

199
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,920
But your jaw area looks
like a middle-aged man now.

200
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,380
Because I'm a middle-aged man.
That's why!

201
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,360
(Exploding)

202
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,480
What?

203
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,460
- Get lost!
- He's upset.

204
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,120
Actually...

205
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,190
Are you wearing a skirt or shorts?

206
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,690
It's a skirt!

207
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,230
- This is a skirt!
- Stop it.

208
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,600
- A skirt.
- Your children are watching.

209
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,770
It looks like a skirt.

210
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,910
Before we start today's race,

211
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:54,300
- I will take your phones.
- Why?

212
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,550
- Please give it to me.
- What?

213
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,920
- I don't have my phone with me.
- Why do you want my phone?

214
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,020
No.

215
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,550
- My phone...
- Please give it to me.

216
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,240
- Why?
- This is important.

217
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,290
- Just take mine.
- Why my phone?

218
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,520
- This is mine.
- Where's mine?

219
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,660
Why?

220
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,530
Why my phone?

221
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,750
(They hand over their phones
with doubts.)

222
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,730
- All our phones?
- What are they writing down?

223
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,920
- They're writing down something.
- What is this for?

224
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,030
I need to check the stock prices.

225
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,100
Now I will tell you the rules
for today's race.

226
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,840
- Please bring in the roulettes.
- Okay.

227
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,710
We're spinning the roulette
from the beginning.

228
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,910
Oh, right. It's the penalty.

229
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,040
What? A roulette?

230
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,410
- I forgot about the penalty.
- That's right.

231
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,720
It's the penalty project.

232
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,050
You know what?

233
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,550
- They started collecting opinions.
- Really?

234
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,980
As you can see, each roulette has
28 slots with your names on them.

235
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,790
- Yes.
- Each roulette has our names.

236
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,880
What is this for?

237
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,300
There will be four missions.

238
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,420
You'll get empty slots
according to your rankings.

239
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,270
You can write the name
of a member you want on the slots...

240
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,730
- and put them on your roulette.
- I should attack others.

241
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,110
You will spin the roulette to decide
which person gets a penalty sticker.

242
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,870
(They will spin the roulette
and give a penalty sticker.)

243
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,440
- Can I write down any name I want?
- Yes.

244
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,980
- Whom should I pick?
- We can choose.

245
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,780
- Who should it be?
- I can pick anyone I want.

246
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,150
So you should try to get
as many empty slots as you can.

247
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,480
This is about probability.

248
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,380
And you just
finished your first mission.

249
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,480
- We did?
- When?

250
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,160
(We already did it?)

251
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,170
We just determined the ranking
with the remaining battery level...

252
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,670
- of your phones.
- What?

253
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,690
My battery was full.

254
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,110
- Mine was very low.
- My battery was almost dead.

255
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,210
Number one is Jong Kook,
100 percent.

256
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,610
It was full.

257
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,550
- I knew it.
- He didn't use his phone at all.

258
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,780
Number two is Ji Hyo, 99 percent.

259
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,920
- Doesn't she use her phone at all?
- I know.

260
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,840
Number three is Jae Suk,
97 percent.

261
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,390
What?

262
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,760
Number four is Haha, 95 percent.

263
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,080
- What about me?
- I guess I'm the last.

264
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,550
Number five is So Min, 90 percent.

265
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,630
Am I number six?

266
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,500
Number six is Suk Jin, 75 percent.

267
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,300
- My gosh.
- I charged my phone.

268
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,690
This is like our stamina.

269
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,190
The last is Se Chan, 50 percent.

270
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,330
- Did you not charge your phone?
- I don't usually charge it fully.

271
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,040
- I see.
- You'll get the empty slots.

272
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,800
Number 1 gets 7 slots.

273
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
- I see.
- That's good.

274
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,650
- I should've charged my phone.
- This is nice.

275
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,810
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Jae Suk,
Haha, So Min, Suk Jin, Se Chan)

276
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,440
My goodness.

277
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,750
- I get only two slots.
- Why did I...

278
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,210
I think it would be fun...

279
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,850
if Suk Jin got a penalty.

280
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,490
Whom should I pick?

281
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,530
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
got penalty stickers last week.

282
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,660
- That's right.
- Yes.

283
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,090
We should distribute the stickers.

284
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,130
- Whom should I pick?
- Who should it be?

285
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,540
- Jae Suk, why...
- Hey, why...

286
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,770
Why do you not agree
that you look like a grandma?

287
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,770
- I agree.
- Do you agree?

288
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,140
- I do.
- Okay.

289
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,240
- So Min.
- Yes.

290
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,780
- I agree.
- Okay.

291
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,840
- Still talking about a grandma?
- Do you not like this shirt?

292
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,410
(Do you not like this shirt?)

293
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,340
- I love it.
- Okay.

294
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,070
- So Min, I agree.
- So Min, I'm happy...

295
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,990
- that I got changed because of you.
- Okay. I get it.

296
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,160
Whom should I attack then?

297
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,550
So I can cover the whole section.

298
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,160
You can completely
cover Section One.

299
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,030
What do I do then?
First, I need Ji Suk Jin.

300
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,170
- Why me?
- Ji.

301
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,870
I'm so envious. I got only one slot.

302
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,190
(Se Chan got only 1 slot.)

303
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,370
Can you give me one?

304
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,930
Can we give the slots to others?

305
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,100
No.

306
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,240
Today, I really don't know
whom I should attack.

307
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,800
Today, it's somewhat...

308
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,570
It's not like I'm mad at anyone yet.

309
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,920
I don't want to write down
any names yet.

310
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,420
I bet they will write Jae Suk's
name a lot because of the opening.

311
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,120
Haha, I will write down
your name on five slots.

312
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,490
Let me see.

313
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,990
(Se Chan also wrote
Jae Suk's name.)

314
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,450
- Why did you pick me?
- I have only one slot.

315
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,820
(The pink cardigan has become
a public enemy.)

316
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
Okay. So this is how it goes.
I get it.

317
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,690
Jae Suk, I have only one.

318
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,540
You have 1, so I'll have 1.

319
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,800
(Getting his revenge)

320
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,060
Haha has 2, so I'll have 2.

321
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,430
(This is the beginning of a war.)

322
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,510
All right.

323
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,020
Then there's Suk Jin.
I'll write down Suk Jin's name.

324
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,340
Why?

325
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,620
(They write each other's names
on 1 slot each.)

326
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,890
I have no choice but to pick
the members who chose me.

327
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,660
Don't be so emotional.

328
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,490
We're doing this for fun.

329
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,320
Yoo Jae Suk on three slots.

330
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,720
- What?
- Jong Kook.

331
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,450
- Yoo Jae Suk for three?
- Done.

332
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,190
Why did you write down my name?

333
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,170
Why did you pick me, Haha?

334
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,240
(He sounds calm.)

335
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,510
(He just said
he was doing this for fun.)

336
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,670
Why did you write my name?

337
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,330
Ha.

338
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,170
- They all wrote down my name.
- Ha.

339
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,840
- Ha.
- Why?

340
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,810
There are people
who weigh on my mind.

341
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,470
(Throwing a tantrum)

342
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,810
- Done.
- Gosh.

343
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,260
(He wrote Haha's name
on 5 slots in a row.)

344
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,890
Because I wrote his name
on one slot?

345
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,490
- I'm just...
- They are five.

346
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,820
I mean, he picked...

347
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,820
It went up fivefold
because I wrote his name.

348
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
- I already got a sticker last week.
- He's throwing a tantrum.

349
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,300
- And...
- I didn't...

350
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,270
- Jong Kook. I didn't pick you.
- Why does it have to be me?

351
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,270
I already got a sticker last week.
Don't you think so?

352
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,040
It's a war from the beginning.

353
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,780
- Ji Hyo, why did you write my name?
- No.

354
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,300
I'm just being fair.

355
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,440
- It's not fair. Why...
- This is so...

356
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,210
Because of your grandma sweater.

357
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,780
This is only fair.

358
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,150
Are you guys done?

359
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,790
- And you checked them all.
- Yes.

360
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,420
You will get changed
and move on to the next mission.

361
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,820
- Okay.
- Yes.

362
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,530
It's cold.

363
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,550
Hey.

364
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,820
Gosh, this is...

365
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,830
Are we writing down something again?

366
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,900
Or maybe it's a drawing game.

367
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,510
Aren't we going to play
a drawing game anymore?

368
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,510
Yes! It's a sketchbook.

369
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,200
- What?
- I haven't been here in a while.

370
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,880
Why? Why do you say that?

371
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,250
This is where
you had a blind date before.

372
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,570
- Right. When I looked like a mess.
- Just...

373
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,940
stay quiet if you don't have
anything to say.

374
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,810
You don't have to comment...

375
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,620
- on everything I say.
- We haven't been here in a while.

376
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,680
My gosh.

377
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,420
I wrote 1 and got 5.

378
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,660
Right?

379
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,950
This is what I say all the time.

380
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,370
I just don't like
an unprovoked attack.

381
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,370
- That's just...
- I had my reasons.

382
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,040
- You did?
- You have your reasons.

383
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,600
- You just don't know that.
- Let's do this.

384
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,870
Why did you write Jong Kook's name
all of a sudden?

385
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,200
You had no reason.

386
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,430
Yes.

387
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,200
- I had.
- You had a reason.

388
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,170
It drives me crazy
that these two get along so well.

389
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,020
(They make a fatal duo
when they get along well.)

390
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,170
I don't like it either.

391
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,890
Jong Kook and I are inseparable now.

392
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,180
Don't be like that!
You should slander each other.

393
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,920
I don't have anything
to say about him.

394
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,680
I just don't like it when he takes
off his shirt on another show.

395
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,850
- So what?
- All right.

396
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,060
This mission is...

397
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,270
Solomon's Choice where
citizens will cast their votes...

398
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,870
to determine your rankings.

399
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,960
- My gosh.
- Is that so?

400
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,740
You will have a free discussion
on various topics...

401
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,330
and write down your own answers.

402
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,880
And we will conduct a survey
of citizens for about an hour.

403
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,380
It's all set...

404
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,810
- in Hongdae and Shinchon like this.
- For real?

405
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,660
(The ballot boards are
all set in Hongdae and Shinchon.)

406
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,990
- This is interesting.
- My gosh.

407
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,420
- Should we get more votes?
- I can win.

408
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,090
There will be
three different subjects.

409
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,800
The first ballot board is
set at a shopping mall...

410
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,770
in Shinchon where there are many
office workers...

411
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,560
- and college students.
- Shinchon?

412
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,140
- Shinchon is...
- It's Shinchon.

413
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,910
And the second ballot board is set
in a karaoke room at Hongdae...

414
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,640
where there are many
young people and foreigners.

415
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,880
(A karaoke room at Hongdae)

416
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,800
Lastly, there will be online voting.

417
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,880
- Online.
- Online voting?

418
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,520
- Okay. Good.
- Online.

419
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,180
The member with the most votes
will be ranked number one.

420
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,120
And you'll get
the roulette slots accordingly.

421
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,120
- But this...
- This is important.

422
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,320
I'm not sure I can win.

423
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,420
The thing is,

424
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,450
your answers will be anonymous.

425
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,300
- That's fair.
- We should do that.

426
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,370
Some people must have
preconceptions about each of us.

427
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,140
It's different from affection.

428
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,400
I'll win over Generation MZ.

429
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,240
Then will they see our debate?

430
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,830
- Of course not.
- No, only your opinions.

431
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,510
- Nice.
- Only our opinions.

432
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,040
- We have a chance to win.
- Nice.

433
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,470
- Yes, we have a chance to win.
- I'm worried.

434
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,380
- Use your personal experience.
- Of course.

435
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,180
If I have no experience...

436
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,210
- You can imagine the situation.
- That's okay, right?

437
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,180
- You can tell someone else's story.
- What topic could there be?

438
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,720
You must've experienced everything
since you've lived long enough.

439
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,180
But why are you scolding her?

440
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,950
- I'll figure it out on my own.
- You've lived long enough.

441
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,530
- I know you're trying to help her,
- Right.

442
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,300
- I mean, she's not that young.
- but you're being unreasonable.

443
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,430
- Don't talk with a scolding tone.
- She must've experienced a lot.

444
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,460
- Suk Jin, come on.
- I'll figure it out on my own.

445
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,910
- I'll tell you the first topic.
- What is it?

446
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,140
- What is it?
- Love?

447
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,910
The bossiest comment
you've ever heard.

448
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,300
(The bossiest comment)

449
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,970
- That's easy.
- The comment that I've heard?

450
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,340
- Yes.
- The bossiest comment?

451
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,710
(What comment could the citizens
most relate to?)

452
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,170
- This topic is...
- There are so many.

453
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,390
- "Back in my days..."
- I know a very simple comment.

454
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,790
Most people would think of...

455
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,050
- the phrase "back in my days."
- That should be left out.

456
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,350
- Such a phrase like that...
- "Back in my days..."

457
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,760
I just heard a bossy comment.

458
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,820
- Me too.
- What was it?

459
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,500
As soon as I came, Jong Kook said...
You heard him, right?

460
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,360
"Why is the door open
when the air conditioner is on?"

461
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,830
- That's not a bossy comment.
- I see.

462
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,060
- You should write that one.
- You meant I should close it.

463
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,560
- Write that down.
- No, I didn't.

464
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,930
Or is it the drawing game?

465
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,990
(Before the mission began)

466
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,660
Won't we ever play
the drawing game again?

467
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,760
(The door was slightly open
because of the power cords.)

468
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,800
Shouldn't we close the door
since the air conditioner is on?

469
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,400
(So Min looks at him nervously.)

470
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,950
We're wasting so much energy.
Right, So Min?

471
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,610
Are you going to close it?

472
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,080
(So Min got up
as the environmentalist complained.)

473
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,450
Good.
That's the youngest member's job.

474
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,010
On the other side.
You should fold that, So Min.

475
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,460
- You meant I should close it.
- That's right.

476
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,330
- No, I didn't.
- I don't think he meant that.

477
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,520
- I've heard something really bossy.
- I think he wanted me to close it.

478
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,600
No, I didn't.

479
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,700
"Just do it."

480
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,200
"Just do it."

481
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,070
It's what Suk Jin says often.

482
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,200
- "Come on. Just do it."
- "Just do it."

483
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,860
- "Stop talking." I'll write it.
- Is it a bossy comment?

484
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,260
"Stop talking."

485
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,130
"Stop talking."

486
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,210
I also say, "Don't think too much."

487
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,610
- "That's how it is" is the worst.
- Right.

488
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,310
- I just heard a bossy comment.
- "Just do it."

489
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,980
Why? What did you hear?

490
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,110
What is it?

491
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,050
"Aren't you old enough
to think of it?"

492
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,240
That's so annoying.

493
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,380
(Aren't you old enough
to think of it?)

494
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,780
(Feeling guilty)

495
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,860
That's the worst.

496
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,280
- Who said that?
- He says that to me and Jae Suk.

497
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,620
- Was it Jae Suk?
- Suk Jin, you just said it to me.

498
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,020
- Suk Jin said it.
- To whom?

499
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,520
- Suk Jin said it to me just now.
- Yes, he did.

500
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,860
- I clearly heard it.
- I didn't say that.

501
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,020
- You said it.
- I've heard this.

502
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,260
- Why are you lying?
- "What do you know?"

503
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,440
- But that's true.
- Right. I do not know.

504
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,000
- That's...
- But I live my life in my way.

505
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,870
- My way, my life.
- It doesn't sound bossy.

506
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,210
"My life, my way."

507
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,680
- Then why does he act bossy?
- "What do you know?"

508
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,580
- It's because...
- "What do you know?"

509
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,980
- The viewers...
- "Then what do you know?"

510
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,850
- "Hey."
- We should guess the first place.

511
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,450
- The thought of it alone angers me.
- "Hey, what are you wearing?"

512
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,030
He sounds so bossy.

513
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,560
"Hey, what are you wearing?"
It's a bossy comment, right?

514
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,000
- But you see...
- You heard that earlier.

515
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,100
Reading the words is not
good enough.

516
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,570
- It depends on the tone of voice.
- Right.

517
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,890
- "Just be quiet."
- "Just be quiet."

518
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,300
- "Just be quiet."
- What about this one?

519
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,570
"Hey, that's not a good idea."

520
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,570
"That's not a good idea."

521
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,470
- "Hey, listen."
- Right. That's a good one.

522
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,400
- All office workers would hear it.
- "That's not a good idea."

523
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,440
- "That's not a good idea."
- "Hey, that's not a good idea."

524
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,580
- That's the perfect tone.
- "That's not a good idea."

525
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,970
(Jae Suk can say the comment
in a perfectly bossy manner.)

526
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,990
- "Shut your mouth. That's not it."
- "Shut your mouth?"

527
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,180
(The reason why he can say it
with a perfect tone)

528
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,360
(No,
I don't think that's a good idea.)

529
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,880
He didn't even let me finish.

530
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,950
(He often cuts others off
and says, "That's not a good idea.")

531
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,920
- This is a perfect example.
- "Hey, what do you know?"

532
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,100
- "What do you know?"
- "What?"

533
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,070
Suk Jin makes
a lot of bossy comments.

534
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,340
- Really?
- Indeed. "Will you sit there?"

535
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,240
- That's not a bossy comment.
- "Will you eat that?"

536
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,900
- I ask those questions politely.
- "Will you eat that?"

537
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,170
- Suk Jin asks, "Will you eat it?"
- "Will you eat it?"

538
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,440
- What about this one?
- "Why are you so late?"

539
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,080
- I know that, but...
- "I'll leave. Do it without me."

540
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,050
- That's thoughtful, not bossy.
- Suk Jin used to say it...

541
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,520
in the early days of Running Man.

542
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,490
That's what he'd say
when he's upset.

543
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,110
- That's him sulking.
- No.

544
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,720
- Really? This isn't bossy?
- That's not bossy but sulky.

545
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,330
- Why do you think it's bossy?
- "I'll leave."

546
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,190
- "I'll leave. Do it without me."
- Who could be that petty?

547
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,220
- He swore after saying this.
- I was just upset.

548
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,570
He swore. I'll add it.

549
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,920
That sounds just petty.

550
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,360
"He swore."
He swore after saying this.

551
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,130
(He added more details.)

552
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,900
And then, he said,
"That filthy jerk Haha."

553
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,610
"Filthy?"

554
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,780
(The story is being updated
nonstop.)

555
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,140
- I didn't say that. Come on.
- You did say that.

556
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,320
- I didn't call him "filthy jerk."
- Yes, you did.

557
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,350
- Why would you come between us?
- It's true.

558
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,550
The week after that, you started...

559
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,060
- staring at me from head to toe.
- Right.

560
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,450
- He said that.
- Hey, Haha.

561
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,860
- I love you.
- Did he really say that?

562
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,220
- Yes, Suk Jin said that.
- That's what a petty man would say.

563
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,030
- "I'll leave. Do it without me."
- That's a bossy comment.

564
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,270
Would this be considered bossy too?

565
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,160
"I'd like to propose a toast."
Does it sound bossy?

566
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,840
- Of course, it is.
- It sounds a little bit bossy.

567
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,070
EYY!

568
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,860
- Enjoy your youth!
- Enjoy your youth!

569
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,400
- MFLF!
- MFLF!

570
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,470
Men's friendships last forever.

571
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,280
Such phrases are old-fashioned.

572
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,350
Super cool!

573
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,050
- There are a lot of such phrases.
- Don't we propose a toast...

574
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,670
when we have a team dinner?

575
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,790
- Especially Jae Suk.
- Don't you do that often?

576
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,680
- He uses a lot of old phrases too.
- To liven up the mood. It's fun.

577
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,860
When my dad uses this word,
it drives my mom crazy.

578
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,090
- It has three syllables.
- What is it?

579
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,390
This would drive you crazy.
It drives you crazy too.

580
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,500
But it's not bossy...

581
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,190
- "Here's advice just for you."
- Right. This could be...

582
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,690
- That's the worst.
- ranked first.

583
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,720
- I came up with this comment.
- Okay.

584
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,630
"Anyway!"

585
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,840
- What's that?
- No.

586
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,160
"Anyway!"

587
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,540
- What's that?
- No.

588
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,130
- "Anyway?"
- I thought he was listening to me.

589
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,310
I explained something to him
for 30 minutes.

590
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,700
Then he said, "Anyway..."

591
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,200
- He wasn't listening to me.
- "Anyway!"

592
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,750
- "In any case."
- "In any case."

593
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,350
- "Anyhow..."
- "Quiet down."

594
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,790
- "That's not a good idea."
- "Shut your mouth."

595
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,450
- "The world has changed."
- Right. "The world has changed."

596
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,530
- "The world has changed a lot."
- That's a good one.

597
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,830
- It's the worst thing to hear.
- "You should be grateful."

598
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,420
- "The world has changed."
- "The world..."

599
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,500
Isn't that what you always say?

600
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,690
- That's right. I often say this.
- I mean...

601
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,070
- That's what you always say.
- "Look at this."

602
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,430
- I've made my decision.
- Why is he so sensitive about it?

603
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,340
- "I'm not so bossy, right?"
- Yes.

604
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,340
- I've picked my answer.
- That's such a bossy comment.

605
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,840
- I wrote my answer.
- What is it?

606
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,240
That's what
a bossy person would say.

607
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
- "Tell me honestly."
- I'll add to that.

608
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,280
- "I'm not so bossy, right?"
- In fact...

609
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,410
(He got inspiration.)

610
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,640
- They don't know they're bossy.
- Right.

611
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,360
When we have guests
who are members of idol groups,

612
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,260
I always ask this
and ended up being called bossy.

613
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
- What is it?
- What do you ask?

614
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,360
"Would you consider me a friend
or an uncle?"

615
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,720
I hate it the most. It's the worst.

616
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,220
- It really is the worst.
- That's the worst.

617
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,570
You'd be considered an uncle.

618
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,800
- Why would he ask that?
- I see.

619
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,860
Right. He must want to know that.

620
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,040
Haha, I think that's a good one.

621
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,740
- "A friend or an uncle?"
- He's insecure about his position.

622
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,310
- Right. Stop worrying about it.
- That's bossy.

623
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,810
- Normally, people say "Shut it..."
- What is yours?

624
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,470
- instead of "Be quiet."
- Oh, I see.

625
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,470
- "Shut it and do as I say." What?
- Isn't it similar to my answer?

626
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,440
"Just do it. Stop talking."

627
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,880
It's different.
They're two different expressions.

628
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,060
- "Be quiet and do as I say."
- "Do as I say."

629
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,260
- It's the same as mine.
- No, it's different.

630
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,760
- You won't accept it, right?
- It's different.

631
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,530
- I wrote it before he did.
- I wrote it first, you punk.

632
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,120
- See?
- "Be quiet..."

633
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,220
- See? He swore again.
- Why...

634
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,360
- Why do you keep swearing?
- That's not a swear word.

635
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,720
- Why would you swear at me?
- The word "punk..."

636
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,890
can be found in novels
and Korean dictionaries.

637
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,430
- You shouldn't...
- "Be quiet and do as I say."

638
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,130
- See? I told you so.
- "I'm saying this for your sake."

639
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,310
I think this is a good one.

640
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,700
- "I'm saying this for your sake."
- That's what I hate to hear.

641
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
- What do you mean?
- Which comment?

642
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,400
- "I'm saying this for your sake."
- I really hate to hear that.

643
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,910
- That's a lie.
- Exactly.

644
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,610
- It's annoying. It's a lie.
- They say it for their own sake.

645
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,050
Those who actually care about you
would never say that.

646
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,850
- "It's because I love you."
- Sorry?

647
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,110
"I'm saying this
because I love you."

648
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,590
Stop copying others' answers.

649
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,120
- I mean...
- It has a different nuance.

650
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,990
- Our answers are all very similar.
- Why would you do that?

651
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,060
Stop copying others' answers.

652
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,500
- They're similar to one another.
- I think this will be ranked high.

653
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,960
- I've made my decision.
- Then go with it.

654
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,390
- Then go with this answer.
- I'll go with this one.

655
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,430
- We all wrote our answers.
- "The world has changed."

656
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,500
- Let's read our answers.
- That's a good one.

657
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,540
- Ji Hyo, what's your answer?
- "The world has changed."

658
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,740
- It's what she told us about.
- I picked...

659
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,810
"Aren't you old enough
to think of it?"

660
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:13,170
- Right.
- That won't be ranked high.

661
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,780
I'll give you a piece of advice.
You...

662
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,050
- "I'll give you a piece of advice."
- "I'll give you a piece of advice."

663
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,110
I'll go with that.
"I'll give you a piece of advice."

664
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,610
"I'll give you a piece of advice."

665
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,910
- I'll just write down what he says.
- You see...

666
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,620
- Change your answer.
- Suk Jin likes to give advice.

667
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,000
- Change your answer.
- He's like a book of answers.

668
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,770
I'm saying this
because we're close friends.

669
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,570
- Write down what Suk Jin says.
- It's the same thing.

670
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,800
That's the same thing.

671
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,070
You should write that comment.

672
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,810
- That's okay.
- Change your answer to that.

673
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,660
- I'll stick to what I wrote.
- I like it. "I'll give you advice."

674
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,280
- We're done.
- Okay. It's been decided.

675
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,810
We'll carry out a survey
with these answers for an hour.

676
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,580
This will be done at Shinchon,
right?

677
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,710
I want to go to Shinchon.

678
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,290
- Suk Jin and I went there often.
- Right.

679
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,450
(What will the citizens choose
as the bossiest comment?)

680
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,880
(Giggling)

681
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,420
That's what Haha would say.

682
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,260
(So Min: Tell me honestly.
I'm not so bossy, right?)

683
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,360
- "Back in my day" is annoying.
- I hate "The world has changed."

684
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,770
- That's bossy.
- That doesn't sound bossy at all.

685
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,810
(Haha: Would you consider me
a friend or an uncle?)

686
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,940
(The survey continues actively
for an hour.)

687
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,180
"Back in my day." This is the worst.

688
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,260
- I never said any of those.
- You're lying.

689
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,490
I found it.

690
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,760
- I said that?
- Yes.

691
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,060
- You asked that question.
- "Would you consider me an uncle?"

692
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,450
(They're having a fun debate
about the bossy comments.)

693
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm a college student.

694
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,800
And I'm 21 years old.

695
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,570
We all go to the same school.

696
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,130
The two of us chose number three.

697
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,310
I picked number five.

698
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,010
He just said,
"I'm not bossy, right?"

699
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,170
He said it while we were talking.

700
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,610
I thought, "That's exactly what
a bossy person would say."

701
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,880
I really don't think I'm bossy.

702
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
(If you don't know,
you're really bossy.)

703
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,450
- That's true.
- Yes.

704
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,560
Asking if he or she is bossy
alone...

705
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,760
proves that the person is bossy.

706
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,720
Those who don't know
that they are bossy...

707
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,830
think they're trendy
and have a young mind.

708
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,570
Among the people who have said it
to me,

709
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,040
there was none who wasn't bossy.

710
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,160
Honestly, you can't find anyone
who's not bossy like me.

711
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,540
What do you mean?

712
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,870
I'm saying
that I'm not bossy at all.

713
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,580
You are bossy.

714
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,700
Do you know what "bossy" means?

715
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,210
Well... A person like Kim Jong Kook?

716
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,350
(A 13-year-old child's
candid evaluation)

717
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,250
I can tell he's bossy
only by looking at him.

718
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,680
- Number 5.
- Number 5.

719
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,360
- Number five?
- Yes.

720
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,290
That's a typical bossy comment.

721
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,360
It's what my grandfather often says.

722
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,600
It makes me feel uncomfortable
and makes me want to go to my room.

723
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,620
I think that I want him
to stop saying such a thing.

724
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,500
Number five. It's offensive.

725
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,400
It sounds like the person is
looking down on me.

726
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,900
"The world has changed."

727
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,110
I hated to hear that
when I was a little boy.

728
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,280
But I found myself saying it
more often as I aged.

729
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,610
Then you should go back to the past.

730
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,640
(What would you feel
when you hear this?)

731
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,210
I picked number seven.

732
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,490
It's obvious that the person wants
to hear a particular answer.

733
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,450
I think the person just wants to be
considered a friend.

734
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,390
It feels like the person wants
to get along with Generation MZ.

735
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,860
It sounds like the person wants
to look younger than he or she is.

736
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,570
(So the survey among the citizens
in Shinchon went on.)

737
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,430
- I heard this so many times.
- This is the worst.

738
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,540
- This is it. Yes, it is.
- No.

739
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,940
- It's the same as "Back in my day."
- I don't think so.

740
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,700
(The worst comment
chosen by the citizens...)

741
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,750
(will be revealed
after the mission ends.)

742
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,440
I'll give you the second topic.

743
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,950
It's for the survey at Hongdae.

744
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,180
- Many young people go there.
- It's about time.

745
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,530
It's my hometown.

746
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,220
The best pick-up line or action
to give the person you like...

747
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,760
- butterflies.
- Come on.

748
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,770
- That's too easy.
- All you have to do is...

749
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,190
smile at her.
You don't need to say anything.

750
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,270
"You look so pretty today."

751
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,660
Just make eye contact with her
and smile at her.

752
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,510
- I know the best pick-up line.
- I have no idea.

753
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,630
I said to my wife before...

754
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,970
when she got in the car,
"Gosh, I'm so annoyed."

755
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,250
- She asked,
- I know.

756
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,750
- "Why? Are you in trouble?"
- I know that story.

757
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,350
I said, "You look gorgeous."

758
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,050
- She liked it.
- This works in all situations.

759
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,020
- She liked it so much.
- "You look so pretty today."

760
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,710
That sounds like a pick-up line
from the 1980s.

761
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,380
- It sounds like a pick-up line...
- "I'm so annoyed." Why?

762
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,950
- from the 1980s.
- Indeed.

763
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,650
It sounds so old-fashioned
that I want to hold a hearing.

764
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,030
Isn't it a good pick-up line?
"Gosh, I'm so annoyed."

765
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,860
- Many people use this pick-up line.
- Not long ago,

766
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,920
- someone said this to me.
- What did he say?

767
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,160
- I wasn't doing anything special.
- Yes.

768
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,240
I just scooped the rice with a spoon
and put it in my mouth.

769
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,130
- And?
- He chuckled and said,

770
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,010
"So Min, you're so cute."

771
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,370
(So Min was eating normally,
and he said she was cute.)

772
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,550
I think...

773
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:43,110
(What?)

774
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,520
- What's that?
- that his birthday was coming soon.

775
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,880
- No. That's not true.
- I'm sure of it.

776
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,650
- Check if he has a debt.
- Right.

777
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,990
- Hey, you're wrong.
- But he really said it.

778
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,990
You paid for the food, right?

779
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,890
No. He burst out laughing
even when I was just breathing.

780
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,830
- I didn't do anything funny.
- It's not what you think it is.

781
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,460
- Even when I just tucked my hair...
- So did you... Yes.

782
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,890
But you shouldn't fall for that.

783
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,960
- But I was flattered.
- That's not right.

784
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,860
- Did you lend him money?
- No, I didn't.

785
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,070
Do you really think so?

786
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,240
You need to act a little bit
when saying this.

787
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,970
- "You look so pretty today."
- You should say it in a cute way.

788
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,140
- But they can only read the words.
- They can't hear us, right?

789
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,870
- No, they'll only read the words.
- I see. Okay.

790
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,850
I don't know.
I'll just write a simple comment.

791
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,550
(He's drunk.)

792
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,710
He's drunk.

793
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,450
(Drooling)

794
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,820
- Then...
- You... You look so pretty today.

795
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,860
(You... You look so pretty today.)

796
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,290
(The overaction
that would never work on anyone)

797
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,500
"You look so pretty."

798
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,300
That's too cheesy.

799
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,460
- When people used pagers,
- That's better.

800
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,460
- many used this pick-up line.
- You mean, 8282?

801
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,270
- Come on. What's that?
- If we go back to those days,

802
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,270
- things will get complicated.
- That's so old-fashioned.

803
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,010
Back in the day, we all used...
This is amazing.

804
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,010
- "Hurry up, my angel?"
- "Hurry up, my angel."

805
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,630
- My gosh. That's too old-fashioned.
- This would suit you better.

806
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,350
- The number 1004.
- "Please hurry."

807
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,050
- "Please hurry."
- It was...

808
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,440
- so popular back in the day.
- That's so funny.

809
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,280
- "Welcome. Please hurry."
- It was popular.

810
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,250
- What do you think of this comment?
- What?

811
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,640
- "I miss you?"
- Yes.

812
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,760
"I miss you?" That's too ordinary.

813
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,620
- I think that's...
- Try to think of something special.

814
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,950
- Suk Jin.
- Did I make you upset?

815
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,860
- Are you upset with me?
- Ji Hyo hasn't...

816
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,390
- No. Why would I be upset with you?
- Then why do you...

817
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,570
- keep criticizing my answers?
- Or... It's simple, but...

818
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,800
It's simple, but what do you think?

819
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,070
"Where shall we go today?"

820
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,130
- No. That wouldn't work.
- "Just go home."

821
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,240
(Just go home.)

822
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
(It's a comment that makes a girl
want to send him home.)

823
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,740
- "Just go home?"
- "Just go home."

824
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,080
- "Just go home?"
- Yes.

825
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,140
- Jae Suk, I wrote my answer.
- Or if I...

826
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,640
- "I'd love to come here with you."
- Come on. I would hate that.

827
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,750
Why?

828
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,140
You'd be at the gym.

829
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,750
- No. What's wrong?
- You want to work out with her?

830
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,060
This was the only pick-up line
I could come up with.

831
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,450
- Oh, my goodness.
- Guys.

832
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,260
- Take a listen.
- My gosh. He's...

833
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,830
- so old-fashioned.
- What is it?

834
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,950
- What is it?
- It worked back in the day.

835
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,960
Gosh. I don't like it.

836
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,100
"You might be bothered
by trivial things."

837
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,460
"Be more confident.
Read the initial letters."

838
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,840
- It means "Go out with me."
- Gosh!

839
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,930
(Go out with me.)

840
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,130
- What's that?
- It would make my heart flutter.

841
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,170
It's an acrostic poem
that means "Go out with me."

842
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,610
- I really like it.
- It's romantic.

843
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,820
"What?
Why is he asking me out suddenly?"

844
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,850
- It's funny though.
- Yes. I'll go with this.

845
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,850
- Right. I think it's a good one.
- "You might be bothered..."

846
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,880
"by trivial things."

847
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,180
"Be more confident. Read the initial
letters." It means "Go out with me."

848
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,910
- It would make her heart flutter.
- It's romantic because...

849
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,950
(Meanwhile, a man is
writing down something quietly.)

850
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,560
It would make her heart flutter...

851
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,720
- only if she's interested in you.
- Look at Jae Suk.

852
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,660
- He's just an old fossil.
- What is it?

853
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,420
- Show me.
- Why would he...

854
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,100
- Why did he write a toast speech?
- What did he write?

855
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,390
JRS.

856
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:20,160
- "Just like a robot and steel,"
- "Just like..."

857
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,340
"I will keep you safe."

858
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,130
- That's good.
- Good. That would work.

859
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,050
"Just like a robot and steel..."

860
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,700
- JRS.
- JRS.

861
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,970
By the way,
this moment makes me sad.

862
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,610
You guys thought of
a lot of bossy comments.

863
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,360
But not this time. I guess you don't
have much love experience.

864
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,830
- Suk Jin, it's difficult.
- The key to romance.

865
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,090
Can you help us a little?

866
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,560
Shall I read you some examples?

867
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,500
Yes, please. What are those?

868
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,530
"I'm not hitting on you."

869
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,530
"I'm betting my life on you."

870
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,270
(I'm not hitting on you.
I'm betting my life on you.)

871
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:54,240
(It's such a cheesy and sleazy
pick-up line.)

872
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,080
(They love pick-up lines like this.)

873
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,440
- Oh, my. I...
- Really? Should we go that far?

874
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,750
- I...
- That's just amazing.

875
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,020
- Should it be that cheesy?
- So Min, what would you do?

876
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,350
It's amazing. I'll go with it.

877
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,020
- I mean, I would...
- So Min, what would you do?

878
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,110
(She's lost for words.)

879
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,150
- I would...
- Can't I?

880
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,120
If a man says that,
I would risk my life for him.

881
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,150
- I can use it, right?
- "I'm not hitting on you."

882
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,920
I can parody the line, right?

883
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
(The man from the 1980s tries
to copy the answer.)

884
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,740
- "I'm not hitting on you."
- It'd make her heart flutter.

885
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,660
- "I'm betting my life on you."
- If a man says that...

886
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,700
(Meanwhile, he's practicing
the pick-up line he just learned.)

887
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,700
- "I'm not hitting on you."
- My goodness.

888
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,240
- "I'm betting my life on you."
- "I'm betting my life on you."

889
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,540
(So Min loves it.)

890
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,940
- That was good. I love it.
- "I'm calling you."

891
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,050
- I really love it.
- That wouldn't work.

892
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,110
We can use it since it's an example.

893
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,250
No, we can't.

894
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,290
"I'm not hitting on you.
I'm tripping you."

895
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,560
(The gym lover ruined
the romantic mood.)

896
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,360
- Write that down, Suk Jin.
- No.

897
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,030
Then I'll compromise.

898
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,260
I'll come up with something
cheesy and romantic.

899
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,570
(What's So Min's answer
that's half cheesy, half bland?)

900
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,100
- So Min added a theatrical vibe.
- What is it?

901
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,660
- Are you writing a book?
- Show me. I'm so curious.

902
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,930
- What is it?
- "The person makes a mistake."

903
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,340
- That's cheesy.
- "Unbelievable."

904
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,540
"You're incorrigible."

905
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,280
"You'll have to be
my responsibility."

906
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,110
- That's cheesy.
- That's too much.

907
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,940
I like this pick-up line.

908
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,870
(It's only cheesy, not bland.)

909
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,640
(Touched)

910
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,610
- I felt it.
- I like this pick-up line.

911
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,210
- It made my heart flutter.
- Right.

912
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,450
(Only Haha likes her pick-up line.)

913
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,530
- It made my heart flutter.
- Good. I like it.

914
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,680
What else?

915
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,260
- It's game over.
- Se Chan.

916
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,000
Write, "You drive me crazy. Darn."

917
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,830
(You drive me crazy. Darn.)

918
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,360
He told me to write, "Darn."

919
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,240
- Hey.
- That's what makes it romantic.

920
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,960
"You drive me crazy. Darn."

921
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,740
(His straightforward confession
made Mirani crazy too.)

922
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,280
- Right.
- Oh, gosh.

923
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,780
I heard about something
that young people do these days.

924
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,440
A man dumps water on his girlfriend.

925
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,710
- Why?
- She says, "What are you doing?"

926
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,710
Then he says,
"I'm watering a flower."

927
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,640
- Suk Jin, that's not romantic.
- "I'm watering a flower."

928
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,710
(Everyone hates it.)

929
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,560
- What is he doing?
- "I'm watering a flower."

930
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,860
- Times have changed.
- They actually do that.

931
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,760
- You should know that.
- I mean...

932
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,030
- You'll be criticized for this.
- Right.

933
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,390
- Why? Isn't it flattering?
- Dumping water on a girl?

934
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,030
- Of course, it's upsetting.
- Really?

935
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,460
- It's upsetting.
- I think it'd be okay...

936
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,130
- if you just opened a bottle.
- I see.

937
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,340
- That's not right.
- "I didn't ask for water."

938
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,610
"I should water my flower."
That'd be okay.

939
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,010
- Right. That's romantic.
- Right?

940
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,240
- No.
- Wait.

941
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,010
I'll be ranked first with this line.
Can I write one of the examples?

942
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,750
- No, you can't use the example.
- One of the examples.

943
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,970
Go ahead.

944
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,780
- Go ahead.
- I'll go with this.

945
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,790
"I'm not hitting on you."

946
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,990
"I'm betting my life on you."
This is amazing.

947
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,710
- Okay. Are you done?
- Yes.

948
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,760
- "You drive me crazy."
- It'll be asked at Hongdae...

949
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,100
- for one hour.
- Okay.

950
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,190
(The streets in Hongdae at 10 a.m.
on Monday are still empty.)

951
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,770
(4. Where shall we go today?)

952
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,360
(6. I'd love to come here with you.
7. You look so pretty today.)

953
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,040
(The survey begins.)

954
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,970
"You might be bothered
by trivial things."

955
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,040
(Se Chan: Go out with me.)

956
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,870
"Read the first letters.
Go out with me."

957
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,610
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook's comments
got many votes in the beginning.)

958
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,520
- It's either number 2 or 6, right?
- I'll pick this comment.

959
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,410
I picked "I miss you a lot."

960
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,860
The fact that there's someone
who misses me...

961
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,030
would make my heart flutter.

962
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:02,150
Since the person thought of me
in his daily life,

963
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,460
I think that means
he's interested in me.

964
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,070
Rather than a straightforward
confession or a compliment,

965
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,800
this comment feels more romantic.

966
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,510
- Number 2.
- Number 2?

967
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,700
Go ahead. What about you?

968
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,740
I pick number five.

969
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,050
Number five? What is it?

970
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,350
That's funny.

971
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,140
"I'm not hitting on you.
I'm betting my life on you."

972
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,820
Are you sure
you want to vote for number five?

973
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,610
What about this one?

974
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,360
"Unbelievable."

975
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,410
"You're incorrigible."

976
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,180
You're so annoying!

977
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,530
"You'll have to be
my responsibility."

978
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,450
It's the worst. I hate it.

979
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,890
"I'd love to come here with you."
That's what I chose.

980
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,190
I was leaning toward number three,

981
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,540
but then he said it to me out loud.

982
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,160
- It...
- He played out the scene.

983
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,200
I felt sick,
so I went with number six.

984
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,780
(The words made me sick.)

985
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,200
This is the worst.

986
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,610
(This is the worst.)

987
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,210
(1: Yang Se Chan)

988
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,380
It's the worst.

989
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,820
This is the worst.

990
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,880
(1: Yang Se Chan)

991
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,150
Entry number one.

992
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,530
"Read the first letters."

993
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,330
That just makes me angry.

994
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,220
Entry number one...

995
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,720
seems too childish
for a serious situation.

996
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,860
How should I put this?

997
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,890
This is what you'd say
after learning the theory of love.

998
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,340
(What was voted as
the best and worst pick-up line?)

999
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,110
The next one is a minor
but a heroic story of yours.

1000
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,800
You are to reveal something good
that you did.

1001
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,870
- Something good we did?
- Yes, that relates to you.

1002
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:33,390
Choose one that will
impress the people.

1003
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,180
Are you supposed to write
the whole story?

1004
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,390
This is going to be posted online.

1005
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,860
- Mine's pretty long.
- Online?

1006
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,360
It can't be something
super impressive though.

1007
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,760
- Something small.
- It must be small.

1008
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,720
Just how frivolous should it be?

1009
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,820
Like carrying heavy bags
for a neighbor...

1010
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,340
- from the elevator.
- Not something like that.

1011
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,340
Someone farted during filming
but I didn't say anything...

1012
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,140
even though the smell was there.

1013
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,370
- That's good enough.
- That I approve.

1014
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,800
- Would that be okay?
- So Min's the one who farted.

1015
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,870
Why would you...

1016
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,450
- She must've had an upset stomach.
- What are you talking about?

1017
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,050
It wasn't me.

1018
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,840
You can't call her out like that.

1019
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,910
I didn't say anything
about Se Chan's stinky feet.

1020
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,160
- When?
- Wasn't that nice of me?

1021
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,910
- Is that allowed?
- Of course.

1022
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,180
- I turned a blind eye to it.
- Must it have been among us?

1023
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,390
No, it can be something you did
outside of Running Man.

1024
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,930
But mine's pretty long.

1025
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,890
- Do you have one?
- Well,

1026
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,990
this was edited out of the show
because I said it myself.

1027
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,030
Jae Joon and I were in a car,

1028
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,640
and we came across a taxi
parked in the middle of the road.

1029
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,970
The driver was screaming for help,

1030
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,410
so Jae Joon and I stopped.

1031
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,470
A drunk passenger of his...

1032
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,510
was fighting
to take control of the wheel,

1033
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,320
so they were in a frenzy.

1034
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,550
The driver was screaming for help,
but other cars...

1035
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,660
drove past him
on the four-lane road.

1036
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,620
Jae Joon and I
parked our car behind the taxi,

1037
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,180
got out, and grabbed
the drunkard to stop him.

1038
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,950
I also called the police as well.

1039
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,220
The police came by
and handled the rest.

1040
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,720
- Why does no one know about this?
- Can you write that all down?

1041
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,660
Shouldn't the taxi driver
be thanking you instead?

1042
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,800
It's why I can't write it down.

1043
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,200
Hold on, I got one.

1044
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,010
- On Mapo Bridge...
- This is a true story.

1045
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,280
A taxi bumped into my car
from behind.

1046
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,050
The rear bumper got caved in.

1047
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,280
I felt bad though,
so I just let him go.

1048
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,510
I've done that many times as well.

1049
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,640
We've all done that many times.

1050
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,240
- Of course.
- Then write it down.

1051
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,590
Why do you sound angry?

1052
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,410
- Write it down.
- There's no need to be angry.

1053
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,160
Why add that you've done it
many times before?

1054
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,820
There was no need for that.

1055
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
- I...
- He's like that sometimes.

1056
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,090
I've gone after
a hit-and-run driver before.

1057
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,820
(Suk Jin's second attempt)

1058
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,660
Did you manage to stop him?

1059
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,760
I wasn't able to.

1060
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,930
(I wasn't able to.)

1061
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,990
(He didn't manage
to stop the driver.)

1062
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,740
- You should've.
- So you just chased him around?

1063
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,800
I can't believe you.

1064
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,410
How is that a heroic story
if you didn't catch the guy?

1065
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,410
The driver hit a person
and drove off.

1066
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,910
At Namdaemun Market...

1067
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,340
- Maybe it was on his way.
- A car hit a pedestrian.

1068
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,950
- It was a minor incident but...
- What about the plate number?

1069
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,050
The driver drove off at high speed
after putting out his taillights.

1070
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,410
I drove after him,

1071
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,820
- but couldn't catch up to the car.
- In my senior year...

1072
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,450
I once mentioned this
on a TV show once.

1073
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,760
It happened back
when I was in high school.

1074
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,990
(Back when Jae Suk
was in high school)

1075
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,160
On my way to school,

1076
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,220
I saw high school kids smoking.

1077
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,260
(Jae Suk came across
high school kids who were smoking.)

1078
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,070
- That sounds dangerous.
- It was 1 against 3.

1079
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,160
It could've been nasty.

1080
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,010
I don't know
what came over me, but...

1081
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,740
- When you were in high school?
- That's right.

1082
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,910
I don't know what came over me.

1083
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,840
Maybe a sense of justice
ignited inside me.

1084
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,140
It was 1 against 3,

1085
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,110
but I asked what they were doing.

1086
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,070
- What?
- They replied,

1087
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,240
"Who do you think you are?"

1088
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,120
- I said, "Put out the cigarettes."
- You approached them first?

1089
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,280
"Put out the cigarettes."

1090
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,510
- You approached them first?
- I don't know what came over me.

1091
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,590
"Put out the cigarettes."

1092
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,720
(Jae Suk patronized
other kids his age.)

1093
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,220
"Who are you to tell us
to put them out?"

1094
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,390
- If only it were me.
- I got scared,

1095
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,320
but I asked how old they were.

1096
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,120
They said,

1097
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,700
"we're 20."

1098
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,700
"We're 20."

1099
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,260
(We're 20.)

1100
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,140
What happened next?
They were older than you.

1101
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
- They were older than you.
- So...

1102
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,740
They were old enough to smoke.

1103
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,870
- Did you apologize?
- And?

1104
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,340
So I got beaten for it.

1105
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,300
(I got beaten for it.)

1106
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,640
What came over you?

1107
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,950
- I don't know.
- They weren't in school uniforms.

1108
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,510
They seemed my age.

1109
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,780
- They must've looked young.
- I saw them as high school kids.

1110
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,240
- Like Haha.
- I strongly believed...

1111
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,120
that high school kids
shouldn't smoke.

1112
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,950
Getting cheeky with men
older than me...

1113
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,360
earned me a beating.

1114
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,660
- Still.
- I showed up at school that day...

1115
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,260
in a shirt
that had been pulled by the neck.

1116
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,120
- How sad.
- You must've been embarrassed.

1117
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,240
They must've been flustered.

1118
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,070
- I don't know what came over me.
- Here's my story.

1119
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,640
- What is it?
- In middle school,

1120
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,530
I packed lunches for friends
who couldn't afford lunch.

1121
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,870
- Really?
- Yes, thanks to my mom.

1122
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,870
- Your mom did all the hard work.
- Exactly!

1123
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,120
- The friends...
- Say that on "My Little Old Boy."

1124
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,910
You weren't the one
who packed the lunches.

1125
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,590
- My friend...
- You should've packed them.

1126
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,780
- He...
- He would always...

1127
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,590
go out to the playground
during lunchtime.

1128
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,050
I get you were being nice.

1129
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,360
- That's all that matter.
- Your mom did all the work.

1130
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,930
How could I have packed him lunch
when I didn't even pack my own?

1131
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,530
Are you sure you didn't steal
other kids' lunches?

1132
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,570
You ate other kids' lunches while...

1133
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,840
Yes, that's true.

1134
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,430
We're supposed to share anyway.

1135
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,200
I'll write this as my heroic story.

1136
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,030
Even though I hated Haha's clothes,

1137
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,700
I praised him by saying...

1138
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,050
- that he looked stylish.
- That's a nice one.

1139
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,280
That really was nice of you.

1140
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,680
You said someone was good looking
even though there was no difference?

1141
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,860
You said someone was good looking
even though there was no difference?

1142
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,360
Isn't that
what you said to me earlier?

1143
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,320
- Se Chan, you look great today.
- What do you mean?

1144
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,930
- He lost some weight.
- You look handsome.

1145
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,360
- It was to encourage you.
- How loyal of you.

1146
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,720
- Of course.
- You wanted to encourage me.

1147
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,970
- We're the same, then.
- Words of encouragement.

1148
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,320
That's also why I said this.

1149
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,930
This is my heroic story.

1150
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,410
While walking my dog,
I cleaned up after other dogs...

1151
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,570
as well as cleaning up after my own.

1152
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,700
- That was sweet of you.
- Nice.

1153
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,840
- Yours and other dogs.
- That was nice of you.

1154
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,550
- You did well.
- Cleaning up after other dogs.

1155
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,780
- I also cleaned the garbage.
- How nice of you.

1156
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,840
Here's mine.

1157
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,890
What is it?

1158
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,680
The meat I carefully grilled...

1159
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,320
was taken from me by a friend,
but I didn't say anything.

1160
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,700
- Unbelievable.
- And I didn't touch the meat...

1161
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,930
my friend had been grilling.

1162
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,550
- Well...
- You...

1163
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,200
- You sound like a loser.
- That's camaraderie.

1164
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,800
You're such a loser.

1165
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,200
- Wasn't it mature of me?
- Yes, but you sound like a loser.

1166
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,370
"I didn't eat the meat
someone else grilled."

1167
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,800
"I won't eat yours."

1168
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,970
(The consideration of a man at 44.)

1169
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,800
- It's tough.
- That's also a heroic story.

1170
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,050
Jae Suk is shy about these things.

1171
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,910
Do you remember
when we all went to dinner together?

1172
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,910
You dropped So Min home...

1173
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,780
even though it took you
two more hours to get home yourself.

1174
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,550
That's what you call
a small but heroic story.

1175
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,820
- Of course.
- It took you three hours.

1176
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,120
- It wasn't on the way.
- I don't see that as heroic.

1177
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,300
It's something anyone could've done.

1178
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,530
It's normal for a colleague
to drop another colleague off.

1179
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,930
- Add on to that.
- That's what I should put down.

1180
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,470
"When Suk Jin
turned his back on her..."

1181
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,240
(When Suk Jin
turned his back on her...)

1182
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,840
- While knowing.
- While knowing!

1183
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,260
- He ignored her.
- Even though...

1184
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,010
- it was raining...
- It didn't rain.

1185
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,300
- No, it rained.
- It rained.

1186
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,340
It was drizzling.

1187
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,450
- No, it poured.
- It was pouring.

1188
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,180
So Min was trying to catch a cab.

1189
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,220
On a rainy day,
when she couldn't catch a cab...

1190
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,050
You asked Suk Jin
to give you a ride home.

1191
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,280
No, I didn't ask him.

1192
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,910
- She didn't ask me.
- I see.

1193
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,360
Even though Suk Jin's place
and mine were in the same direction,

1194
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,990
he pretended not to hear Jae Suk...

1195
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,300
when he offered me a drive home.

1196
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,990
- Suk Jin had the advantage.
- Even though...

1197
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,070
But he didn't offer me a ride.

1198
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,300
Jae Suk already offered,

1199
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,640
so who am I to offer her
a ride home too?

1200
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,200
- That'd be weird.
- Even though...

1201
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,640
Come on, So Min. I gave you a ride
to Incheon Airport recently.

1202
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,010
That was for a show.

1203
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,070
- So...
- Be quiet, will you?

1204
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,370
(Suk Jin fails
to salvage his image.)

1205
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,620
This won't make it in the top three.

1206
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,450
- This is what I'm going with.
- What is it?

1207
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,590
I let someone else
have the 40g protein snack...

1208
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,620
and had
the 20g protein snack instead.

1209
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,780
- That's huge!
- How generous of you.

1210
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,050
- This is incredibly huge.
- That...

1211
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,300
That is worth mentioning.

1212
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,200
To those who lift weights...

1213
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,370
- That's huge.
- It is a touching story.

1214
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,990
Are we good?
Did you take the photos?

1215
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,160
Hold up what you wrote.

1216
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,300
Thank you for taking the time
to write these down.

1217
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,140
What you wrote
have been put up for a vote...

1218
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,200
both online and on the streets.

1219
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,530
This is huge.

1220
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,800
The votes will be tallied
while you have lunch...

1221
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,870
- and the results will be revealed.
- Okay!

1222
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,550
- Nice!
- Yes!

1223
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,140
- This won't be in the top three.
- Nicely done.

1224
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,890
(The online voting begins.)

1225
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:51,260
(Running Man Online Poll)

1226
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,930
(The suggestions
were put to a vote...)

1227
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,390
(both in Hongdae and Shinchon.)

1228
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,160
(Who got the most votes?)

1229
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,570
The votes have been tallied
and the results are out.

1230
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,740
- Come on!
- Right.

1231
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,970
I doubt I made it
high up in the ranking.

1232
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,220
- I think otherwise.
- I call upon the MZ generation.

1233
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,050
Here's the result
for the online poll.

1234
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,220
- Sure.
- I doubt I scored many votes.

1235
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,220
- The heroic story...
- I'm not too hopeful for that one.

1236
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,220
- Me neither.
- It was just for fun.

1237
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,660
I bet Ji Hyo got a lot of votes.

1238
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,700
She mentioned the dogs, right?

1239
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,760
I was only trying to be cute.

1240
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,990
(I was only trying to be cute.)

1241
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:36,260
(Whose heroic story
was chosen as the best?)

1242
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,240
(The result)

1243
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,140
- With 46...
- Gosh, that's a lot.

1244
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,970
- Me?
- Seriously?

1245
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,470
- Me?
- Yes.

1246
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,550
Seriously?

1247
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,010
- No way.
- Yes!

1248
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,740
I'm the one who reminded you
of this anecdote.

1249
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,370
- I appreciate it.
- I assisted you.

1250
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,740
- This...
- Please don't forget that.

1251
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,120
(Out of 4,272 votes,
he received 2,004 votes.)

1252
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,490
Jae Suk, you...

1253
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,320
- Seriously?
- It's at 47 percent.

1254
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,510
- I won first place?
- Come on.

1255
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,180
- Of course.
- It's me!

1256
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,990
- The dogs.
- I knew it.

1257
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,390
I would've ranked higher
had I stuck with the lunch story.

1258
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,590
In third place is So Min
who complimented one's looks...

1259
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,090
even though he didn't
look all that handsome.

1260
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,530
- So Min?
- That's in third place?

1261
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,530
Many wrote the reason as to
why they voted for each story.

1262
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,110
"Giving someone a ride home
is the textbook move of a hero."

1263
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,140
"Time is gold, and he shared
his gold with a colleague."

1264
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,550
My gosh!

1265
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,220
- Nicely put.
- I love that comment.

1266
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,410
- That's cool.
- That's cool.

1267
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,620
Time is gold.

1268
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,780
- He always does it.
- That's meaningful.

1269
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:35,030
"By revealing it, Seok Sam is given
a chance to reflect on himself."

1270
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,050
That's also true.

1271
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,090
- That's also true.
- Right. It's a nice story.

1272
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,390
The point is he pretended
not to hear it.

1273
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,470
Yes.

1274
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,530
- Someone said it wasn't good.
- I see.

1275
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,140
"Did he have to badmouth someone
to say a good thing about himself?"

1276
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,800
That's true as well.

1277
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,870
That's a clear judgment.

1278
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,680
- That's sharp.
- It's good.

1279
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,840
- It fits our sentiment these days.
- Yes.

1280
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,950
And there's someone
who didn't like...

1281
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,510
So Min's fake compliment
about someone's ugly look.

1282
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,860
"She has to give a direct advice
so that her colleague can improve."

1283
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,780
That's right.

1284
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,220
That's good.

1285
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,550
- You should be honest.
- It's...

1286
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,160
- convincing as well.
- That's funny.

1287
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,200
- That's true.
- Yes.

1288
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,490
"It's hard to say it's good that
he didn't tease about the fart..."

1289
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,840
"in the middle of the shoot."

1290
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,260
- Right.
- He didn't do his job.

1291
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,010
- He should've said it for the show.
- Yes.

1292
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,370
- He didn't do his job.
- He missed a chance to be funny.

1293
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,200
About Haha's story about meat.

1294
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,780
"That's pathetic."

1295
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,470
I told you it was pathetic.

1296
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:35,140
"Thinking like that itself
is shameless."

1297
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,510
Bite me.

1298
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:40,450
- "Bite me?"
- I'll eat all the meat then.

1299
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,820
Look. That's pathetic too.

1300
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,490
- What's with "Bite me?"
- That's so...

1301
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,200
It's about the compliment about
Haha's outfit, which was last place.

1302
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,890
Yes, that's me. What did they say?

1303
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,530
"It's like a flattery
of a disloyal subject."

1304
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,740
(It's like a flattery
of a disloyal subject.)

1305
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,470
- They're eloquent.
- They're eloquent. I acknowledge.

1306
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,870
"That's why Haha
is still living an illusion."

1307
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,140
- That's true.
- That's right.

1308
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,050
"Sometimes, realistic advice is
better than a lie for your friend."

1309
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,120
Realistic advice.

1310
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,760
- So that he can realize.
- Being objective.

1311
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,620
The next is "the words
from an old fossil."

1312
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,760
The words from an old fossil.

1313
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,450
- I'm curious about that.
- Please let me rank high.

1314
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,300
(Revealing)

1315
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,160
- That's right.
- Who is first place?

1316
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,160
(Which sounds the most
boomer-like among these?)

1317
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,090
- Wait. What?
- Number five...

1318
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,840
- got the most votes.
- "The world has changed."

1319
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,890
(Boomer Ji is 1st place.)

1320
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,160
- He's such a boomer.
- Suk Jin.

1321
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,140
I told you so.
"The world has changed."

1322
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,610
- I'm in last place again.
- Second place is So Min.

1323
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,280
- These guys...
- Third place is Jae Suk.

1324
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,680
Fourth place is Haha.

1325
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,870
Jong Kook is in 5th place, Ji Hyo in
6th place, and Se Chan in 7th place.

1326
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,390
Look at them.

1327
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,720
What do they know?

1328
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,050
- What made their heart flutter.
- It's...

1329
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,280
- It's...
- At this rate, I have no hope.

1330
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,820
- It's my weakness.
- I won't be ranked high.

1331
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,120
- I'm anticipating.
- What I said is plain. It's weak.

1332
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,370
- It was weak.
- You're anticipating?

1333
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,160
Which one received the most votes?
"I miss you a lot" got a lot.

1334
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,930
- It got a lot of votes.
- It's "I miss you a lot."

1335
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,570
"I'd love to come here with you."

1336
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,240
- Many people chose it.
- I'm in last place.

1337
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,510
I'm in last place again.

1338
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,340
(Last place 3 times in a row)

1339
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,370
He's in last place.

1340
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:06,680
"I miss you a lot." Yes.

1341
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,220
- Indeed, love...
- It's classic.

1342
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,950
- doesn't need grandeur modifiers.
- Right.

1343
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,120
"I miss you" is the best.

1344
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,220
- "I miss you." It's honest.
- Yes.

1345
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,860
- "I miss you."
- You don't need pretty words.

1346
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,260
That's true.

1347
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,590
Right. You don't need those things.

1348
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:26,720
Adding the total number of votes and
percentage for the online survey,

1349
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,840
- the ranks were decided.
- I'm in last place.

1350
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,470
First place is Jae Suk.

1351
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,910
You should remember me.

1352
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:34,910
This is annoying.

1353
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,570
Second place is unexpected.
It's Suk Jin.

1354
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,870
Thank you.

1355
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,240
That's from years of experience.

1356
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,010
Third place is Ji Hyo.

1357
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,780
Ji Hyo did better than I thought.

1358
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,820
Fourth place is So Min.

1359
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,260
Fifth place, Jong Kook, sixth place,
Haha, and seventh place, Se Chan.

1360
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,030
I declare war against
Millennials and Generation MZ.

1361
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,720
- How can you not know?
- It's okay.

1362
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,320
- Should I put it on the second one?
- Yes.

1363
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,760
That's right. Round two.

1364
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,160
Why did you write my name again?

1365
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,140
I can't deal with you today.

1366
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,740
I can't deal with you today Haha.

1367
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,470
I just wrote one.

1368
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,370
(Disappointed)

1369
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,610
Okay. Go ahead.

1370
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,050
When I become the first place,
I'll write your names only.

1371
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:16,320
- Then I'll do it right now.
- I got it.

1372
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,410
- All right. I got it.
- You got it?

1373
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,590
- Okay. Let's stop here.
- Let's stop here.

1374
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:22,320
So MIn, did you write four?

1375
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,220
Five? Good. Provoke me.

1376
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,820
That's good. I'll write So Min
no matter what next time.

1377
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,050
Please let me
become the first place.

1378
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,490
I'll fill it with So Min's name.

1379
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,030
- Did you all put it on?
- Yes.

1380
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:37,240
- Let me explain the next mission.
- Okay.

1381
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,910
It's Yoom Yoom Human Fish
where you should eat a donut...

1382
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,030
hung on the fishing line.

1383
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,180
It sounds fun.

1384
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,280
Before doing the mission,
pick one member to help you.

1385
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,570
The member who was picked
can refuse.

1386
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,970
The member trying the mission should
stand at the starting point...

1387
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,010
and eat the donut
hung on the fishing line.

1388
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,260
The assistant should hold
the member's arms behind them.

1389
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,360
So that the member can lean
to eat the donut.

1390
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,890
I see.

1391
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:06,200
- Holding is important.
- Right.

1392
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,430
If you succeed, you can try
the next one in the back.

1393
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,570
The one who eats the donut that is
farther will be ranked higher.

1394
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,870
- Core muscles are important.
- They should be able to hold us.

1395
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,180
- Core muscles are important.
- It's war.

1396
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,180
The one who will be holding us
would be important, right?

1397
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,240
It's very important.

1398
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,450
We can reject, right?

1399
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,140
No simulation?

1400
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,640
If you refuse too many times,
they might write your name...

1401
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,820
- on the roulette.
- Let's start without simulation.

1402
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,260
- Really?
- We can't refuse too many times.

1403
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,510
How do we get to choose?

1404
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:33,050
I'll try.

1405
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,090
- That's unusual.
- I'll help him.

1406
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:36,160
- Really?
- I'll help him.

1407
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,700
- I'll help him.
- I'll help him.

1408
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:38,990
I'm better.

1409
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,340
- I...
- Jong Kook is mine. Don't pick him.

1410
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,640
- They have to hold me, right?
- Yes.

1411
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,430
- I'll choose Jong Kook.
- Okay.

1412
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:49,840
Are you going to accept it?

1413
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,800
- Yes.
- You can refuse it.

1414
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,450
- I'll do it.
- If he refuses,

1415
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,120
- he might take revenge.
- Sure. I'll do it.

1416
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,470
- Writing his name on the roulette.
- Thank you.

1417
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:59,180
I'll hold you well. Don't worry.

1418
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,990
Can we pick Jong Kook again?

1419
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,320
- Yes, you can.
- We can pick him again?

1420
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,680
- He's popular.
- But...

1421
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,050
- I can't trust the other guys.
- Who is going to do this?

1422
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,950
How should I do it?

1423
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,490
- How? Since you have to eat it...
- Yes.

1424
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,700
Hold on.

1425
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,700
Isn't it best to eat this way?

1426
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,370
- I don't think I can go far.
- Or stretch the side.

1427
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,740
Try it without a donut first.

1428
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,970
- It works.
- Keep going.

1429
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,470
I can eat this for sure.

1430
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,800
- It's the third.
- Jong Kook.

1431
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,470
Pull me more. Okay.

1432
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,200
- Okay.
- I said not to worry.

1433
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,300
I'll try the third one.

1434
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,700
- One spot further.
- You're going to do this, right?

1435
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:30,720
- This position.
- Yes.

1436
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:33,410
- It's...
- He wrote your name too many times.

1437
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:36,160
- What if he writes my name again?
- One, two, three, four.

1438
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,320
- If he's in last place...
- It's hard to refuse.

1439
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,660
- Right. Or he will write your name.
- Yes.

1440
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:40,950
- Here I go.
- Go.

1441
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,320
I'll try.

1442
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,760
I'll do it properly
since we're working together.

1443
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,370
- Squat all the way down.
- All right.

1444
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:49,590
(He starts leaning slowly.)

1445
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,970
But why did you write my name?

1446
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,840
The one behind him
can betray him, right?

1447
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,070
- Yes.
- Okay.

1448
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,300
- You can't do it if you're weak.
- Haha's grip got weaker.

1449
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,680
- Hey.
- Wait.

1450
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,140
- Hey.
- Wait.

1451
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,340
(Sticky rice cake makeup)

1452
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,010
- Why did you do that?
- I got it.

1453
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,680
- Hey, you should stretch your arms.
- Jong Kook couldn't hold it.

1454
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,680
- His strength...
- He should stretch his arms,

1455
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,950
but he kept doing this.

1456
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,590
- You made it impossible for him.
- I did my best, didn't I?

1457
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,970
- Yes, you did.
- I did my best.

1458
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,870
Why did you keep your arms
like this? You should stretch them.

1459
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,800
He's frustrating.

1460
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,870
Was it me?

1461
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,640
- It was you.
- I stretched my arms.

1462
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,240
I'll do it one more time for you.
Let him do it one more time.

1463
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,800
- I'll give you one more chance.
- Yes.

1464
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,180
Hey. Stretch your arms.
Don't do this.

1465
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,470
Gosh.

1466
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,680
I'll do it properly this time.

1467
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,240
I'll sit completely.

1468
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:40,890
Stretch your arms.

1469
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,510
- I'm totally stretching my arms.
- I'm going to sit. Hey.

1470
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,820
- Try it. Hold me tightly.
- Here I go.

1471
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:46,280
Go.

1472
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,550
Stretch your arms. Yes.

1473
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:51,530
Does it work or not?

1474
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,090
He looks like a catfish.

1475
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,390
- Does it work? Should I go down?
- It's hard.

1476
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,490
- His lips touched it.
- Did his knees touch the floor?

1477
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,300
- His knees touched it.
- They touched it.

1478
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,160
- Keep your knees off.
- They totally touched the floor.

1479
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,870
He did it.

1480
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,870
- Keep your knees off.
- They totally touched the floor.

1481
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,970
(He completed stage 4.)

1482
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:09,320
We should remove the second one.

1483
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,870
You need a lot of strength.

1484
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,050
Gosh.

1485
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,510
This is the farthest.

1486
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,950
- Are you going to do it?
- I don't think I can do it.

1487
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,550
- The one you did earlier...
- I don't think he can do more.

1488
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,930
- Right.
- Hold me tightly.

1489
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:25,970
I can hold it
as much as I did earlier.

1490
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:27,660
- Try it.
- Will Jong Kook be able to hold it?

1491
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,200
- Look.
- His arms can't do it.

1492
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,390
- His arms can't reach.
- It'll work.

1493
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,660
His arms can't do it.

1494
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:34,700
- His arms can't reach.
- It'll work.

1495
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,020
- His arms can't reach.
- It'll work.

1496
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,000
(Laughing)

1497
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,920
(His sticky rice makeup
looks heavier.)

1498
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,600
- Gosh.
- It's funny.

1499
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,170
You should let me go when I fall.

1500
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,440
What?

1501
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,410
- Why would I let you go?
- If you hold me so tightly...

1502
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,830
You'll fall even harder
if I let you go.

1503
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,040
- Jong Kook did his best.
- What should I do?

1504
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,270
- Jong Kook did his best.
- In the middle...

1505
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,210
Jong Kook, my back hurts so much.

1506
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,040
Get up. Okay.

1507
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,370
What should I do?

1508
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,980
No one can do it.

1509
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,810
I'll try.

1510
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:15,980
- Ji Hyo will try it?
- Ji Hyo.

1511
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,020
- Who do you want?
- Jong Kook.

1512
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,420
- Can you hold me?
- Okay. Come.

1513
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,420
I think I can do it.

1514
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,690
How are you going to do it?
Are you going to try it?

1515
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,230
- Yes.
- Give me your hands.

1516
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,330
Hold my hands here.

1517
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,100
The donut...
Get into position first.

1518
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,100
- Jong Kook...
- The donut.

1519
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,330
also pronounces it as "donut."

1520
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:32,810
- The donut.
- The donut is quite far.

1521
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,170
Get into position.

1522
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,770
Older people pronounce it
as "donut."

1523
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,770
- Are you in position?
- Yes.

1524
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,410
- Ji Hyo is pretty flexible.
- Jong Kook.

1525
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:40,980
Your bottom should go down too,
Ji Hyo.

1526
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,140
She looks like a lizard.

1527
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,520
- She can't reach it.
- It's actually hard.

1528
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,120
- She's getting it.
- She's getting it.

1529
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,750
- She's getting it.
- Bite it.

1530
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,920
All right. Let's go down, Ji Hyo.

1531
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,060
- She's getting it.
- There you go.

1532
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,460
- Let's go down, Ji Hyo.
- She's getting it.

1533
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,560
- She's getting it.
- There you go.

1534
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,560
(She fell on the flour slowly.)

1535
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,270
- It's hard.
- Let go of her.

1536
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,770
- That's as far as we can go.
- She just went down straight.

1537
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,390
- She even used her whole body.
- Don't your hands hurt?

1538
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,770
- Don't your hands hurt?
- I did reach it,

1539
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,230
but it didn't come into my mouth.

1540
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,230
What if we fall after taking a bite?

1541
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:10,980
That will be counted.

1542
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,210
(It'll be counted as long as
they take a bite of it.)

1543
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,670
We don't have to hold each other.

1544
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:17,120
- Why?
- We can just take a bite of it.

1545
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,670
- No, but that's...
- So you can fall as you eat?

1546
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,810
That's not easy to do.

1547
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,080
- Why not?
- No, it won't work.

1548
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,580
- Come on, So Min.
- It won't work?

1549
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,890
- Of course not.
- It won't?

1550
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,210
I'll give it a go.

1551
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,390
Go ahead, So Min. Who will hold her?

1552
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,520
It's not easy to eat it.

1553
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,120
So Min said she'd
jump to bite it off.

1554
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,790
I succeed as long as
I take a bite, right?

1555
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:35,190
- Then I will...
- I felt it as I did it.

1556
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,790
- One, two, three...
- They should be way taller.

1557
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,500
I want it a little further
than Level Four.

1558
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,710
- A little further than Haha's.
- It's impossible to do it.

1559
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,910
- It is?
- A little further than Level Four?

1560
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:43,310
But Haha did it at Level Four.

1561
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:44,330
Are you going to jump
and bite it off?

1562
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,940
- Yes. I'll give it a try.
- It'll be funny.

1563
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,350
- Give it a try, So Min.
- It could work.

1564
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,210
- As expected.
- She said I just need to bite.

1565
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,940
- Great.
- Let's go, Tiger Moth!

1566
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,480
- Without touching it.
- I like that spirit.

1567
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,520
- It's great!
- Tiger Moth!

1568
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,580
- Try it with your spirit!
- You can do it!

1569
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:57,210
If you succeed in this,

1570
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,660
I won't write down your name
for the whole day.

1571
00:53:58,690 --> 00:53:59,980
- Your name.
- Really?

1572
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,020
Yes, I mean it.

1573
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,850
I should try the same way
after seeing So Min go.

1574
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:05,660
Right? It's not a bad idea, right?

1575
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,420
You need strength like Superman's...

1576
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,790
which you can fly in the air.

1577
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,770
- She must stop midway.
- After you jump,

1578
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:14,500
you should turn like this
and take a bite.

1579
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,210
Please shoot it in slow motion too
in case she eats it.

1580
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:17,370
Is she a hero?

1581
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,210
I'm so nervous.

1582
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,410
- I'm so nervous.
- I applaud your challenging spirit.

1583
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:22,480
- I can't succeed in it anyway...
- Let's go.

1584
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,580
if I eat it like this.

1585
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,040
- It's ready.
- It's ready.

1586
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,480
(Here I go!)

1587
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,480
- It's ready.
- It's ready.

1588
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,750
Gosh, So Min.

1589
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:34,690
(Laughing)

1590
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,600
- That was cool.
- You looked like a fool.

1591
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,960
So Min failed.

1592
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,600
- Let me try one more time.
- You looked like a tiger moth.

1593
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,890
What's even worse
is that she got scared.

1594
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,940
(She got scared.)

1595
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,170
- She got scared midway.
- So Min...

1596
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,960
So it was useless to run up to it.

1597
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,770
- She got scared.
- She got really scared.

1598
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,100
- It was scary.
- Right.

1599
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,580
- I could reach it, though.
- Yes, but it bounces off.

1600
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,850
I should try her way.

1601
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,100
- I could reach it.
- You?

1602
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,710
- Really?
- Jong Kook, you'll give it a go?

1603
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,420
- There's no other way.
- You should open your mouth wide.

1604
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,420
No one can hold me.

1605
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,120
- Why not?
- I'll hold you.

1606
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,390
- I'll do it for you.
- I think it'll work...

1607
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:03,480
if I don't get too greedy.

1608
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,790
Maybe I'll go for Level Three.

1609
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,330
It's better to succeed
in Level Three.

1610
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:07,390
I'll go for Level Three.

1611
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:08,790
- Which level did Haha succeed in?
- Level Four.

1612
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,060
- Level Four.
- He succeeded in Level Four?

1613
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,390
I think I can do this much.
I'll bite off one.

1614
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,460
You'll secure Level Three first.

1615
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,290
- Then you'll go for another one?
- Because you have to bend.

1616
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:17,330
- You want me to hold you?
- Will you hold me?

1617
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,140
- You want me to do it?
- I think you can.

1618
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,330
- Hold on.
- Give me your hand.

1619
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:21,810
- Hold me like this.
- Haha.

1620
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,210
It'll be funny
if Haha betrays him here.

1621
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:24,580
(It'll be funny
if Haha betrays him here.)

1622
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,100
If Haha...

1623
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,080
Jong Kook.

1624
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,250
(This won't do. Move!)

1625
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,290
Don't you know him?

1626
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,210
- I didn't do anything!
- His eyes already flipped.

1627
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,480
The look in his eyes
looked suspicious, right?

1628
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,560
You come here.

1629
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:39,960
- I can't trust him either.
- Why not?

1630
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,920
- Hold on.
- You must check their eyes.

1631
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,960
Look at them.

1632
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,350
Which one will you choose?

1633
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,420
Jong Kook, make your choice.

1634
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,190
There's no one I can trust here.

1635
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,500
- Look at us.
- Look into our eyes.

1636
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,640
Look into our eyes.

1637
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,210
What should I do?

1638
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,770
- Jong Kook.
- Do you want us to do it?

1639
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,910
(Will he choose the eyes of
halibut or frozen pollack?)

1640
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:00,250
(Contemplating which fish to choose)

1641
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,440
You should just do it. Come here.

1642
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,440
His eyes
are already flipped, though.

1643
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,020
- Haha, you can do it!
- You chose the person...

1644
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,250
you should've avoided the most.

1645
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,310
- His eyes are flipped. This is bad.
- You can do it!

1646
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,190
Look at his eyes.

1647
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,390
Haha, you know
I'm working really hard, right?

1648
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,850
Okay.

1649
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:20,520
- Hey.
- I think it'll work.

1650
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,690
How come it didn't?

1651
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,290
- Haha is...
- Let's go, Haha!

1652
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,290
(Practicing how to betray him
with his flipped eyes)

1653
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,170
You can do it! Don't be scared.

1654
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,310
You got this!

1655
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,810
- That's it.
- Let's make a big hit.

1656
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,350
- Don't bend my arm.
- I'm trying to hold you.

1657
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:34,500
It looks great.

1658
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,670
- You shouldn't...
- You look stable.

1659
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,440
You can't do that, Haha.

1660
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,980
- Haha. You should also...
- Haha.

1661
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,580
- lean back after placing your foot.
- That's right.

1662
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,920
- That way, you can support me.
- That way, it'll be balanced.

1663
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,060
Look at his eyes.

1664
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:46,790
Hey.

1665
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:48,690
His eyes are already zonked out.

1666
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,290
You should lean back
with your foot on me.

1667
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,170
We need to make a V shape
so our weight will be balanced.

1668
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:55,730
- A V shape?
- That's right.

1669
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,230
Not this kind of V. This one.

1670
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,310
That's the fun of it.

1671
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:01,810
But if I write his name...

1672
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,500
Jong Kook has written my name
so many times.

1673
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,100
So you ought to take revenge.

1674
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,040
You just need to hold out a little.

1675
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,520
But Haha won't just stay still.

1676
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,210
- But Haha...
- He's done for.

1677
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,920
- Hey, don't say such things.
- Why not?

1678
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,480
We're only saying this
for your sake.

1679
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,120
- Look at his eyes.
- Don't do that.

1680
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,480
It's all for your sake.

1681
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,020
- Look at his eyes.
- He's already gone crazy.

1682
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,420
Haha is grabbing his hand
in a way...

1683
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,690
- that'll be easy to let go.
- If he just pushes Jong Kook...

1684
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:26,390
- with his knee...
- His grip is getting loose.

1685
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:28,500
- Push him with your knee.
- Look at his grip getting loose.

1686
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,330
- Gosh.
- He's letting him go.

1687
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,810
- That's it. Come closer.
- We just need to grab the string.

1688
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,830
All right. A little closer.

1689
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,170
Just a bit more.

1690
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,810
(Pulling a prank
with the fishing pole)

1691
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,210
(He explodes in the end.)

1692
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,390
No, Suk Jin told me...

1693
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,980
Suk Jin told me to do that!

1694
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,190
- That's not true.
- Suk Jin told me to do that.

1695
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,230
- Suk Jin told me.
- That's enough.

1696
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:56,560
All right!

1697
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,160
Gosh, seriously.

1698
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,690
(The prankster got scolded
by Jong Kook again.)

1699
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,100
Let's go for it. Let's make it work.
I'm not trying to be greedy here.

1700
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,310
Let me get closer, Haha. That's it.

1701
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:08,410
Haha, you should go closer.

1702
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,710
No, I'm almost there. There you go.

1703
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:12,480
You have no idea how tightly
he's grabbing me.

1704
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,500
I can't do anything right now.

1705
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,420
- I can't do anything.
- You're like a pillar.

1706
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,580
He's grabbing me so tight
so he won't fall.

1707
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:20,920
Just lick it.

1708
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,920
- Bite it.
- Gosh.

1709
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,690
- Gosh.
- He got it.

1710
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:25,960
- Goodness.
- You did it.

1711
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,890
(Gosh.)

1712
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,500
- You did it.
- Gosh, he did it.

1713
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,920
He's no joke.

1714
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,600
- Gosh, he's...
- Gosh, seriously...

1715
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,690
I only went for Level Three!

1716
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,060
- Se Chan.
- Yes.

1717
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,600
Let's try a different approach.
Let's try a backflip.

1718
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,410
- A backflip?
- Oh, with your back against it?

1719
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,870
- Will it work?
- Look at this.

1720
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,410
Jae Suk, I locked my feet
with yours. Great.

1721
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,500
But I can't lean back
if you lock me too hard.

1722
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,500
How far will you go?

1723
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,600
Or you can grab my shirt.
There you go.

1724
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,040
- Like "The Matrix?"
- There you go.

1725
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,710
- This is great.
- Yes, it's great.

1726
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:54,390
- It'll work.
- That's it. This will work.

1727
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,660
- It'll work.
- I'll go for Level Three.

1728
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,690
That's too weak.

1729
00:58:58,690 --> 00:58:59,690
You should go for Level 3.5...

1730
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,160
- because the angle...
- Go for Level 3.5.

1731
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,850
- It's possible for Level 3.5.
- You should face front first.

1732
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:04,960
- That's right.
- Facing front won't do.

1733
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,390
- It's difficult.
- This is Level 3.5.

1734
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:07,790
Go for it, Jae Suk.

1735
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:09,600
- It's hard this way.
- Just try it.

1736
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,290
This way. Will it work?

1737
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:13,230
It will work.

1738
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,000
(Surprised)

1739
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,440
(Hold on!)

1740
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,100
Hold on!

1741
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:23,520
- Hey, Se Chan.
- All right.

1742
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,210
- We haven't even begun.
- But this will work.

1743
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:26,420
- But it'll work.
- Hey.

1744
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,480
We haven't even begun.

1745
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,660
But I was trying on the grip.

1746
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,310
You can go far as long as the person
at the back doesn't betray.

1747
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,020
- Jae Suk.
- I'll go with my back against it.

1748
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,080
- All right. Grab it.
- I'll lock my feet with yours.

1749
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,920
You want me to grab it?
I locked my feet with yours.

1750
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,330
- Take a look.
- Hold on.

1751
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:40,500
- Wait.
- You got it.

1752
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,330
You got it? No, wait!
I'm not ready yet.

1753
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,290
(He ate it?)

1754
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,040
You got it? No, wait!
I'm not ready yet.

1755
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,560
- Is this how it's done?
- He did it.

1756
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,000
Didn't his head touch the floor?

1757
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,410
No, he didn't say he'd go.

1758
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,600
He needs to say he'll go.

1759
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,440
I'm sure that he'll let go of me...

1760
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,620
if I try it again.
You need to count that.

1761
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,170
- I won't let go of you!
- Otherwise, I can't do it.

1762
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,540
- Jae Suk, I will never let go.
- Hyung In, I can't do this.

1763
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:02,690
You need to count it.

1764
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:04,390
- Darn it.
- Will you let go of him?

1765
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,960
No, I won't because I need you
to hold me for my turn.

1766
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,830
- He'll let go of me for sure.
- Get up now.

1767
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:11,160
- He'll let go of me for sure.
- Come on.

1768
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,190
- Hurry.
- He'll let go of me for sure.

1769
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:14,870
He will let go of me.

1770
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,500
- Don't worry, Jae Suk.
- All right, it'll be counted.

1771
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,960
- Great.
- Come on!

1772
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,410
- Then I'll go for Level 4.5.
- This isn't right!

1773
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:22,500
- It was a practice.
- Let's vote.

1774
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,170
- Right. It was a rehearsal.
- It really was a practice.

59:58,269 --> 01:00:00,199
Whatever! I'll write only Jae Suk's
name for the next one.

1775
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,940
- Write his name.
- If I get to write a name,

1776
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,410
I'll write one person's name
in all seven slots.

1777
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:30,420
I'll succeed in Level 4.5.

1778
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,870
Then Se Chan won't let you.

1779
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,210
Why is he so confident
that he'll get seven slots?

1780
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,850
- This is stable.
- Won't you slip with this?

1781
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:36,960
- It might fall.
- It'll work for sure.

1782
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,160
It'll snap.

1783
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,190
I think it'll snap.

1784
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,830
- This is great.
- Hold on.

1785
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,600
- This is great.
- It'll snap.

1786
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,160
Wait.

1787
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,920
I told you to wait!

1788
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,690
- Why didn't you hold me?
- I need to get ready too!

1789
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,690
- Hey!
- Don't just lie down.

1790
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,230
- You should've grabbed me!
- Why did you go down?

1791
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:54,500
Let's go.

1792
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,640
Se Chan...

1793
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,810
(Ripping)

1794
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,350
Hey, why did you untie it?

1795
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:02,770
Hey. Se Chan, this isn't right.

1796
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:04,670
- All right.
- I'll hold you when you do it.

1797
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,210
- You're right.
- Right?

1798
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,210
- I'll hold you like this.
- Okay.

1799
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:10,160
- Is he going for Level 4.5?
- Yes, he is.

1800
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,890
- Level 4.5?
- Come a little closer.

1801
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:14,290
- Should I? I'm good.
- You should step on me.

1802
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:17,060
Se Chan has been in last place
many times recently.

1803
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:18,730
Se Chan, why are you...

1804
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,870
- Darn it.
- Why are you...

1805
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,670
(Ripping)

1806
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:24,170
(The belt hit him
in the wrong spot.)

1807
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,140
- Well done.
- Oh, no...

1808
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,710
- He failed, right?
- He failed.

1809
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:28,770
He failed.

1810
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,500
- Darn it. Hey!
- Jae Suk, you failed.

1811
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:33,810
- It just ripped.
- How could you...

1812
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:35,870
- How could you let go?
- It ripped!

1813
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:37,040
Why did you...

1814
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,980
You should let them
succeed once first.

1815
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,640
Then Level 3.5 was counted right?
What a bummer.

1816
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,250
I could've done it.

1817
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,460
- Just try it.
- It's such a bummer.

1818
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,330
From here...

1819
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,890
(You'll fall just like this.)

1820
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,190
You'll fall just like this.

1821
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:53,190
(Flopped)

1822
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,190
Suk Jin, I'll do it for you.

1823
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:56,290
Wait a minute. Wasn't that a couple
on a honeymoon?

1824
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:59,600
- Let me do it for you.
- Wait a minute.

1825
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,140
Wasn't that a couple on a honeymoon?

1826
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,310
I felt weird too.

1827
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:03,770
- Hey...
- I felt weird too.

1828
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,100
Wasn't that like your wedding night?

1829
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,870
- Trust me.
- Hey!

1830
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,600
- Hold on. It was obviously...
- Darn you.

1831
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,040
- like a wedding night.
- Just trust me.

1832
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,920
Or we could do this.
You know the grasshopper pose, right?

1833
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,920
That will work.

1834
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,980
You should put your feet
on his legs.

1835
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,480
- You can't use your hands!
- No, not like that.

1836
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,080
- Go forward a little.
- Not like that.

1837
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,080
- You should grab over here.
- Okay.

1838
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,080
- You know the "Titanic" pose.
- That's it.

1839
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,000
Lift your hands, Suk Jin. In one...

1840
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,690
- Lift him up.
- You need to get your hands off.

1841
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:26,830
There you go.

1842
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:28,500
- Lift him up.
- You need to get your hands off.

1843
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,600
There you go.

1844
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,730
(He face-planted on the floor.)

1845
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,330
How are you going to do this?

1846
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,100
I didn't do anything.

1847
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,210
(It seems like
Suk Jin can't think clearly.)

1848
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,580
Hold on. How do I do this?

1849
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:40,410
- I don't have a strong core.
- Listen.

1850
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,750
It's not a matter of your core.

1851
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,370
It will work
if Jae Suk holds you right.

1852
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,250
- Grab my pockets.
- Okay.

1853
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,310
Okay. Grab my pockets.
You got them, right?

1854
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:49,850
- Will it work?
- I got them.

1855
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:52,080
- You feel stable, right?
- I love it.

1856
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,520
- Good.
- Go for Level 3. That's Level 4.

1857
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,580
- Okay.
- It's too far.

1858
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,960
- This far.
- That's a good idea.

1859
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,230
I can go that far.

1860
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:03,440
- Here you go.
- "Here you go?"

1861
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,870
Why did you say, "Here you go?"

1862
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:06,870
- Are we going?
- "Here you go?"

1863
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,460
- "Here you go."
- Why did you say, "Here you go?"

1864
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,940
(He says it correctly
and gives it a go!)

1865
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,080
Jae Suk, let's go!

1866
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,580
For goodness' sake.

1867
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,080
Stop pulling.

1868
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,670
- I am trying to go down.
- All right.

1869
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:17,710
Jae Suk should pull.

1870
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,310
His mouth touched the donut. Eat it.

1871
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:20,690
There you go.
Jae Suk, you need to lower him.

1872
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,040
- He got it.
- He got it.

1873
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,250
He ate it.

1874
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,420
- Jae Suk, you need to lower him.
- Go down.

1875
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,560
- He got it.
- He got it.

1876
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,730
He ate it.

1877
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:30,160
You succeeded in Level Three.

1878
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,350
- Why...
- Let's do it the same way.

1879
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,560
- Then I will succeed in it.
- Why did you do it so nicely?

1880
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,020
- Let's do it the same way.
- Why did you do it so nicely?

1881
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:35,230
I ate it.

1882
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,690
I will go for Level Four this time.

1883
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:37,940
Lower him.

1884
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,140
Here I go.

1885
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:40,710
- I don't think he will betray him.
- You need to eat it.

1886
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:42,540
- I wouldn't betray him.
- I mean... Hey.

1887
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:43,910
He looks serious.

1888
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,100
- Hey.
- He looks serious.

1889
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,850
Hold on.

1890
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:48,910
(Showing his underwear)

1891
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,210
Hey!

1892
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,250
Suk Jin showed his underwear.

1893
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,040
I can't believe you.

1894
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:56,750
- Hey.
- I didn't do it on purpose.

1895
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,210
I was pulling with all my might.

1896
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,890
I couldn't see.

1897
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:02,160
- I couldn't see.
- That's no excuse.

1898
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,460
- The entire world will see it.
- When you went down,

1899
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,020
- I had to lower my body.
- I saw his eyes.

1900
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,100
- Jae Suk's eyes were serious.
- That's right.

1901
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,390
- I didn't fool around, did I?
- That's right.

1902
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:12,190
- He did it with seriousness.
- I didn't fool around.

1903
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:13,960
- I will grab this part.
- Don't do that.

1904
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,330
- It would be better.
- It would be nice.

1905
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,910
- It would be much better.
- This is nice.

1906
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:18,830
All right.

1907
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:20,870
- A bit lower.
- I got you. A bit lower?

1908
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:21,940
A bit lower.

1909
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,140
- He ate it.
- See?

1910
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,350
- He ate it.
- See?

1911
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:28,890
- Did he eat it?
- I guess he ate it.

1912
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,350
Success.

1913
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,020
Did he succeed in Level Four?

1914
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,290
I ate it as I went down.

1915
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:34,460
- Right?
- I see.

1916
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,580
You have my acknowledgment.

1917
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,350
Someone help me.
I need to place first this time.

1918
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:38,460
- I will help you.
- Okay.

1919
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,190
- I won't fool around.
- Really?

1920
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,230
- Se Chan, it's your turn.
- I will help you.

1921
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,960
- I ate it as I went down.
- Level 3.5.

1922
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,540
- I ate a lot.
- I will help you.

1923
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:48,460
Se Chan, do it the other way
so that you face the camera.

1924
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:49,810
There you go.

1925
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,730
There you go. That's good.

1926
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:53,080
I think you stink.

1927
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:56,670
I am sorry.

1928
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:57,980
- My goodness.
- I am sorry.

1929
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,540
- Hey.
- I am sorry.

1930
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,690
Did Mr. Sour strike?

1931
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:02,810
I am sorry.

1932
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,960
Hey.

1933
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,250
(He smelled grandma's meju
even before Chuseok.)

1934
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:07,290
Did you put something on your feet?

1935
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:08,350
Hang in there.

1936
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:09,960
- That's teamwork.
- Okay. I will help you.

1937
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,830
Se Chan, you have an advantage
since you have a protruding mouth.

1938
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:14,690
- He ate it.
- Yes.

1939
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,960
I will give you the final rankings.

1940
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,440
- First place, Suk Jin.
- Yes.

1941
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,710
Second place, Haha.

1942
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,870
Third place, Se Chan.
Fourth place, Jae Suk.

1943
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:28,640
Fifth place, Jong Kook.
Sixth place, So Min.

1944
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,270
- Seventh place, Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

1945
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:31,980
I give hope to people in their 50s.

1946
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:34,480
Since I have six stickers,
I might put everyone's name.

1947
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,520
(He begins to put
the roulette stickers.)

1948
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,190
Okay. I will do it like that.

1949
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:38,480
I can accept that.

1950
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,980
You should leave me out.

1951
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,460
Why would I leave you out?

1952
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,020
- Won't you leave me out?
- Aren't we on the same boat?

1953
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,730
Are you going to write my name?

1954
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,250
Then I will write your name
on all stickers.

1955
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,600
- Then I will write your name too.
- Go ahead.

1956
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,600
- It will be each other's loss.
- You are right.

1957
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,040
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

1958
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,460
- Leave me out.
- Who wrote my name?

1959
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,710
I wrote everyone's name
except for mine.

1960
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,270
- I can accept one sticker.
- In any case...

1961
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,580
Yes.

1962
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,520
- Let's distribute them evenly...
- You wrote my name.

1963
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,480
so that the outcome will be random.

1964
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,790
Stop writing my name.

1965
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,480
- You wrote my name.
- Should I keep writing your name?

1966
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,690
- Write my name.
- Should I do that?

1967
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:11,560
- I will write your name.
- I will write your name.

1968
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,850
I will write Ji Suk Jin
on every slot.

1969
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,580
I will write Yoo Jae Suk
on every slot.

1970
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:16,020
- Okay.
- Okay. Write my name.

1971
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,120
I will write your name
on every slot.

1972
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,120
Seriously.

1973
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,160
Write my name.

1974
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,120
- Did you write my name?
- On every slot.

1975
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,000
- I wrote it on every slot.
- Fine. Okay.

1976
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,640
I will write your name
on my future stickers too.

1977
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,330
- Same here. Suit yourself.
- Okay.

1978
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:27,410
Good.

1979
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:31,810
If you write my name,
I will write your name.

1980
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,210
Did you write my name?

1981
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:36,770
You wrote my name?

1982
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,310
Okay.

1983
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,540
I wrote Kim Jong Kook on two slots.

1984
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,890
- I will explain the last mission.
- Okay.

1985
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:47,330
In childhood, have you played
a game called Kkomkkomi?

1986
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:48,520
- What?
- Kkomkkomi?

1987
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,750
- Doesn't it involve hiding?
- Yes.

1988
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,620
This mission is Kkomkkomi,
a childhood game...

1989
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:54,620
which is a mix of tag
and hide-and-seek.

1990
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:56,270
- I see.
- I know what it is.

1991
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:57,670
- I played Dabanggu.
- It involves hiding.

1992
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:59,000
- I played Dabanggu too.
- I played Dabanggu.

1993
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,310
- You go, "Kkomkkomi."
- It's different in each region.

1994
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:02,600
- It's my first time hearing it.
- Kkomkkomi?

1995
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,440
While the tagger
goes and touches a certain point,

1996
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,980
other members will hide
with bells attached to their shoes.

1997
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:11,210
When the tagger comes back
to the starting point...

1998
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:14,890
and yells, "Kkomkkomi, kkomkkomi,
Gangnam's swallow is here,"

1999
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:16,250
the search begins.

2000
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:19,310
You are out if you get tagged.

2001
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:22,290
If you succeed in touching the flag
without getting tagged...

2002
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:23,350
and yell, "Kkomkkomi,"

2003
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:24,460
- you will receive points.
- That's right.

2004
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:27,330
You will receive three points,
which is the highest point.

2005
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:30,040
Those who didn't get tagged
in the set time...

2006
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,600
will get zero points.

2007
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:35,500
Those who got tagged out
will receive negative points...

2008
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,270
- in the order it happened.
- That means...

2009
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:38,940
- we need to yell "Kkomkkomi."
- I know.

2010
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,480
We need to win points.
Zero points mean nothing.

2011
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,100
You will win points
if you come out and touch the flag.

2012
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,350
We need to yell "Kkomkkomi."

2013
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:46,080
You will play three rounds.

2014
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:48,390
The tagger's score will be
the number of missed members...

2015
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:49,690
times minus three.

2016
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:52,980
The order of the scores
will determine the rankings.

2017
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,960
Does it go into your nostril?

2018
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,230
(They had a preliminary mission
of Playing the Nose Flute.)

2019
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:58,660
Suk Jin is the tagger.

2020
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,100
We will set up the cameras.

2021
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,500
(Suk Jin becomes the tagger
thanks to his poor lung capacity.)

2022
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,100
- Suk Jin, do you start here?
- Do I start here?

2023
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,870
Are you ready?

2024
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,600
Where can we hide?

2025
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,910
The 1st and 2nd floors
of the building can be used.

2026
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,100
Where? Here?

2027
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,710
- So I start here and...
- Go downstairs and come back.

2028
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:15,270
- Go downstairs and come back.
- People will hide during that time.

2029
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:16,440
Okay.

2030
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:19,940
Come back and say,
"Kkomkkomi. kkomkkomi..."

2031
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,040
- Then the game begins.
- Then...

2032
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,460
- you can search for the members.
- Okay.

2033
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,020
- Get ready.
- This is hard.

2034
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,350
- This is hard.
- Set, go.

2035
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,560
- Where should I go?
- This isn't easy.

2036
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,890
- Let's go.
- Set, go.

2037
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:35,670
(Suk Jin runs fast as he can.)

2038
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:37,190
Should I just make myself visible?

2039
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:39,190
Seriously. This isn't easy.

2040
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,640
I will touch the flag right away.

2041
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,100
- I will make myself visible.
- That would be better.

2042
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,230
We just say, "Kkomkkomi."

2043
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:47,140
(So Min hides under a table.)

2044
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,120
(Ji Hyo goes inside to be safe.)

2045
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:58,620
He won't think to look here.

2046
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,960
Please hide me.

2047
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:05,460
(Suk Jin reaches the point.)

2048
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,130
(He works hard
and even adds sound effect.)

2049
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:11,890
(Jae Suk, Jong Kook, and Haha
didn't hide yet.)

2050
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:13,760
This spot is a dead end.

2051
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,760
I think I can stay here.
He won't be able to catch me.

2052
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:20,210
(The current location)

2053
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,270
This spot is a dead end.

2054
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,620
(The tagger appears.)

2055
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,440
- Will it begin already?
- He came back very quickly.

2056
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:32,790
Kkomkkomi, kkomkkomi,
Gangnam's swallow is here.

2057
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,260
(Now, they will be eliminated
if Suk Jin touches them!)

2058
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,430
He came back too quickly.

2059
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,050
(Now, they will be eliminated
if Suk Jin touches them!)

2060
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,390
(He charges toward Jong Kook
without fear!)

2061
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:40,590
He came back too quickly.

2062
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:42,330
(At that moment)

2063
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:43,800
(Peek-a-boo)

2064
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,190
Do we just yell "Kkomkkomi?"

2065
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:51,840
Kkomkkomi!

2066
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,550
(Se Chan yelled "Kkomkkomi!")

2067
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:54,880
For goodness' sake.

2068
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:58,810
(Now is my chance.)

2069
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:00,510
- Kkomkkomi!
- For goodness' sake.

2070
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:01,620
- Kkomkkomi!
- Kkomkkomi!

2071
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,840
(2 kkomkkomis in a row)

2072
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,180
- For goodness' sake.
- Kkomkkomi!

2073
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:08,180
All right.

2074
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,050
(So Min was hiding nearby.)

2075
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:11,390
(4 people succeeded in
yelling "Kkomkkomi.")

2076
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:13,130
- For goodness' sake.
- Kkomkkomi!

2077
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:15,000
So Min, success.

2078
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:18,040
(Jong Kook had no intention
to hide from the start.)

2079
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,170
I touched you.

2080
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:20,470
(Suk Jin's camera)

2081
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,540
(After losing 4 people,
he succeeded in touching Jong Kook.)

2082
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,510
- He got Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook is out.

2083
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:25,210
Only Ji Hyo remains.

2084
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,080
Only Ji Hyo remains.

2085
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:30,640
(Only Ji Hyo remains.)

2086
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,580
This isn't easy.

2087
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,720
- It's hard.
- From different directions...

2088
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:35,590
The tagger is lonely in this game.

2089
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,980
- The tagger is the loneliest.
- That's why...

2090
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,090
I don't want to be a tagger.
It makes me sad.

2091
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:40,660
It makes me sad.

2092
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,090
It's the role So Min hates the most.

2093
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,760
- Seriously.
- So Min, stop moving.

2094
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:45,930
- Why?
- I hear the bell.

2095
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:48,970
(Teasing him with the bells)

2096
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:50,130
It's confusing.

2097
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:52,340
He won't think
to search the vicinities.

2098
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,970
(Ji Hyo is in the building.)

2099
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:55,840
Now!

2100
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,540
(Turning around)

2101
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:00,180
Where is she?

2102
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:03,270
- She isn't here.
- The tagger is lonely in this game.

2103
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:04,550
Where is she?

2104
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:05,840
- Time's up.
- Zero points.

2105
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,750
You failed to find Ji Hyo.

2106
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:11,620
Suk Jin, you caught one member.

2107
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:14,090
- Minus 15.
- Your score is minus 15.

2108
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:16,380
The tagger is at a disadvantage.

2109
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,500
- Seriously.
- I won't place last.

2110
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:19,720
I will place last.

2111
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,430
- Kkomkkomi!
- Where were you?

2112
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:22,560
I was over there.

2113
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,470
- You can't do it. Time's up.
- Time's up?

2114
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:25,540
- Time's up, Ji Hyo.
- Really?

2115
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,930
This time, the tagger will be
Jong Kook...

2116
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:30,380
since he was the only member
who got caught.

2117
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:31,730
- Jong Kook?
- My goodness.

2118
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:32,930
- It will be difficult.
- This is bad.

2119
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:35,210
- It won't be easy.
- Jong Kook.

2120
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:37,080
- What should I do?
- It won't be easy.

2121
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:39,010
Jong Kook is a bit...

2122
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,680
- I should go inside.
- I should go inside.

2123
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,290
I have no other choice.

2124
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:45,290
Jong Kook is too scary.

2125
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,130
What should I do?

2126
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,720
- I will go easy on you.
- It's closer than you think.

2127
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,090
The flag is closer than you think.
You can reach it in no time.

2128
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:53,090
If you are ready,
let's begin right away.

2129
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:55,300
- Shall we begin?
- We should go inside.

2130
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,630
Take your time.

2131
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:57,760
Set, go.

2132
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,760
(Round 2 begins.)

2133
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,840
It won't be easy
since Jong Kook is the tagger.

2134
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,970
(He sets off
as if he is warming up.)

2135
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:08,750
(Ji Hyo and Haha
decide to wait inside the building.)

2136
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:13,810
(Suk Jin and Se Chan head
toward the staff members.)

2137
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:15,790
This way.

2138
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,960
Come here.

2139
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,460
Move a bit to the back.
I need one person.

2140
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:22,480
Okay. A bit more.

2141
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,830
A bit more.

2142
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:24,830
(Suk Jin makes a wall
of staff members.)

2143
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:29,970
(Se Chan chooses the table
next to the staff members.)

2144
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:38,770
(The tension is thick
compared to the last round.)

2145
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:41,180
- Where should I hide? This is bad.
- Where should I go?

2146
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:44,180
Jae Suk, don't come this way.

2147
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,380
Why?

2148
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:49,620
(The cowardly siblings hide
at the same spot.)

2149
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,380
He will definitely come here.

2150
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:00,760
(He reaches the halfway point.)

2151
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:03,500
Kkomkkomi, kkomkkomi,
Gangnam's swallow...

2152
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,670
As soon as he enters,
we need to run.

2153
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,260
I should hide here.

2154
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,380
- Please help me.
- Okay.

2155
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:14,880
When Jong Kook comes,
I will go and yell "Kkomkkomi."

2156
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:17,220
He wouldn't think to look here.

2157
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,050
How would he think to look here?

2158
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,920
It would be unimaginable.

2159
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,380
(Will they avoid Jong Kook's radar
as they wish?)

2160
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:33,350
(Jong Kook comes back
in a relaxed way.)

2161
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,760
(Scanning)

2162
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,930
Kkomkkomi, kkomkkomi,
Gangnam's swallow is here.

2163
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:42,370
(The arrival of Gangnam's swallow
scares them badly.)

2164
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:43,470
My goodness.

2165
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:45,380
(The arrival of Gangnam's swallow
scares them badly.)

2166
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,800
(Glancing over)

2167
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:52,840
(Jong Kook's camera)

2168
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,480
(Screaming)

2169
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,340
(It only took 5 seconds.)

2170
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,720
How did you find me?

2171
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,480
- I saw you.
- Suk Jin is out.

2172
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,590
How did you find me?

2173
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:01,720
I saw you right away.

2174
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:04,050
(Thank goodness.)

2175
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:08,590
(He spots
the suspicious blue outfit.)

2176
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,300
Who was that?

2177
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:16,170
(Startled)

2178
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,510
Se Chan is out.

2179
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,580
I could see your back.

2180
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,050
- We can't outrun Jong Kook,
- I could see it.

2181
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,920
so we resort to tricks.

2182
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,220
Jong Kook is coming.

2183
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,260
(Jae Suk and So Min's hiding place)

2184
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,380
The production crew.

2185
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,720
(What should we do?)

2186
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,880
Over there.

2187
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,390
if they are inside...

2188
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:41,330
(Jong Kook heads over
to So Min and Jae Suk!)

2189
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,590
You might succeed
if you make a run for it now.

2190
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,840
(His eyes widen more
and his mouth protrudes more.)

2191
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,730
You might succeed
if you make a run for it now.

2192
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:53,130
(Did he spot them?)

2193
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:54,340
Come now.

2194
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:56,580
Come now.

2195
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,140
(Screaming)

2196
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,340
(Jae Suk gets taken out
by himself.)

2197
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,550
My goodness.

2198
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:08,680
(Haha runs upon hearing
Jae Suk's scream.)

2199
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:10,720
Kkomkkomi.

2200
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,390
(Haha yelled "Kkomkkomi.")

2201
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,500
- Okay. Yes!
- What? Are you out?

2202
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,560
For goodness' sake.

2203
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,190
We get too scared
to contend against him.

2204
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:20,930
- For goodness' sake.
- Did he catch all of you guys?

2205
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:21,970
Yes.

2206
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:23,340
No way.

2207
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,080
So Min and Ji Hyo remain.

2208
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:27,680
Too bad.

2209
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,720
(The survivors look
for the right time to run out.)

2210
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:35,920
(Jong Kook heads toward Ji Hyo.)

2211
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:41,050
(Did he leave?)

2212
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:42,590
(He left!)

2213
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,930
- He hasn't left yet!
- Hey.

2214
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,830
(Chiming)

2215
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,690
(Detective Jong Kook
was looking in all directions.)

2216
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:55,340
- Why did you come out?
- I thought he left.

2217
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,600
The cameraman gave me a sign...

2218
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,410
- that he left.
- I knew one member was there.

2219
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,470
- Gosh, So Min.
- Too bad.

2220
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,270
How is Ji Hyo so good at hiding?

2221
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:05,080
Why is he over there?

2222
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:08,050
Time's up.
Ji Hyo, please come on out.

2223
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:09,620
- Where is she?
- She is so good at hiding.

2224
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:10,920
(Jong Kook caught four members.)

2225
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,260
- For goodness' sake.
- Good.

2226
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,830
Is it over?

2227
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,790
I think she is coming from there.

2228
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:18,190
Congratulations. Hurry over here.

2229
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:19,190
(Ji Hyo succeeded in hiding
2 times in a row.)

2230
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:23,020
Suk Jin was the tagger before,
so this round's tagger will be...

2231
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,170
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2232
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,500
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2233
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,540
Thank goodness.

2234
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:29,430
- Thank goodness.
- Okay.

2235
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,880
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2236
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:34,470
Ready. Set, go.

2237
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:36,250
Set, go.

2238
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,470
(Round 3 begins.)

2239
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:42,510
(As soon as Jae Suk leaves,)

2240
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,810
(Se Chan takes off his top.)

2241
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:49,930
(He uses camouflage
to look like a staff member.)

2242
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,720
(He hides in a lousy way again.)

2243
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,540
I will win points in this round.

2244
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,840
(Laughing)

2245
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,930
Kkomkkomi,

2246
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:05,430
kkomkkomi,
Gangnam's swallow is here.

2247
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:06,430
(They face each other.)

2248
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:07,640
Jong Kook, I see...

2249
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,550
- that you want to get eliminated.
- I will win points.

2250
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,920
(While Jae Suk's eyes are
on Jong Kook)

2251
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:16,050
(Laughing)

2252
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:18,720
Kkomkkomi.

2253
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:19,720
(Se Chan yelled "Kkomkkomi.")

2254
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,720
- Suk Jin.
- Touch.

2255
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,590
(Suk Jin ran out
at the wrong time.)

2256
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,300
(He ran as fast as he could,
but he didn't stand a chance.)

2257
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,720
(Touch!)

2258
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:30,500
I thought someone would be here.

2259
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,730
(Sad)

2260
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,760
You changed.

2261
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:35,510
(Only Se Chan succeeded
in yelling "Kkomkkomi!")

2262
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,300
- He is fast.
- He is fast.

2263
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,380
Kkomkkomi.

2264
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:39,630
It's better to get him
out of the picture.

2265
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:40,640
(Jong Kook succeeded
in yelling "Kkomkkomi.")

2266
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,750
All right.

2267
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,440
Kkomkkomi.

2268
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,380
Now is your chance.

2269
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:47,750
- Come. Hurry up.
- Now is your chance.

2270
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:48,880
- Kkomkkomi.
- Kkomkkomi.

2271
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,880
I touched you first.

2272
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,960
- I did it first, right?
- Kkomkkomi.

2273
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,010
- I touched you first.
- Kkomkkomi.

2274
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:53,720
- You didn't touch the flag.
- I did!

2275
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,090
- She didn't touch the flag.
- So Min didn't do it.

2276
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:56,680
- They are out.
- Was I supposed to touch it?

2277
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,500
- She didn't touch the flag.
- Both of them are out.

2278
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,630
I touched the flag first.

2279
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:01,020
- So Min is out.
- Out.

2280
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,260
Didn't So Min touch the flag?

2281
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:03,970
- No.
- It's too bad.

2282
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:05,130
Was I supposed to touch it?

2283
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:08,470
- I will give you the results.
- Okay.

2284
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:10,370
First place, Haha.

2285
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:12,010
First place?

2286
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,540
Second place, Ji Hyo.

2287
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:15,010
Third place, Se Chan.

2288
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:16,270
Fourth place, So Min.

2289
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:17,840
- Fifth place, Jong Kook.
- I didn't place last.

2290
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,680
- I keep placing fifth.
- Sixth place, Jae Suk.

2291
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,340
Seventh place, Suk Jin.

2292
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:22,550
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

2293
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:25,720
You will fill out the slots
for the last time.

2294
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:28,130
We will spin the roulettes
one at a time.

2295
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:31,300
The moment your name comes out,
you will get a penalty sticker.

2296
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:34,370
You could get seven penalty stickers
if you are unfortunate.

2297
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:36,130
(A total of 7 stickers
will be distributed.)

2298
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:38,090
(There will be 7 express tickets...)

2299
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:42,540
(to the legendary penalties!)

2300
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,380
- Whose name should I write?
- Whose name should I write?

2301
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:46,430
This is so stressful.

2302
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:47,750
It's okay.

2303
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:49,550
My name is
on the most number of slots.

2304
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:50,680
My name is on many slots.

2305
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:53,940
Whose name is on the fewest slots?
I should write them down.

2306
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,620
- Is it Haha?
- My name is on many slots.

2307
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:56,840
Is it Ji Hyo?

2308
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,480
Suk Jin, I got chosen last week.

2309
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,720
You are right.

2310
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,460
Suk Jin wrote down my name
on many slots.

2311
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:05,020
That's not true.
Your name is only on two slots.

2312
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,590
- Really?
- Three.

2313
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:08,890
Hey.

2314
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:11,040
- It can't be helped.
- What's wrong with you?

2315
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,500
It can't be helped.

2316
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:13,590
You only wrote my name.

2317
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:15,430
It can't be helped.
I have no other choice.

2318
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:16,870
- For goodness' sake.
- I have no other choice.

2319
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:18,800
On how many slots is my name?

2320
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,010
- Haha wrote my name on many slots.
- What?

2321
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:21,880
So Min wrote my name
on so many slots!

2322
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,010
I only did it
because you wrote down...

2323
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,510
- my name earlier.
- I didn't write down your name.

2324
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,310
That's not true.
You wrote down my name.

2325
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:31,790
- So I wrote down your name.
- You wrote it on two slots, right?

2326
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:32,960
I will write your name on two slots.

2327
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,090
I will write your name again then.

2328
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:35,330
Haha.

2329
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:36,550
Are you serious?

2330
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:37,550
So Min.

2331
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:40,460
- You just wrote down my name.
- It's a match. He wrote it down.

2332
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,670
Haha again.

2333
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:42,720
So Min again.

2334
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:44,040
Haha and So Min are having a match.

2335
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,390
- You...
- You wrote my name again.

2336
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:48,210
- I will fill all the slots.
- Are you serious?

2337
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:50,510
- Then I will do the same.
- It's a match.

2338
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:53,630
Haha.

2339
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:54,710
(They fill the slots
with each other's names.)

2340
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:55,970
- Why did you write my name?
- Go.

2341
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:58,340
- You wrote my name.
- You wrote my name.

2342
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:01,640
Hey, So Min.
So Min wrote your name once.

2343
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,940
Se Chan doesn't disappoint.

2344
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,050
- Look at this.
- Hey.

2345
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:05,550
- I wrote it once.
- He wrote it once.

2346
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,050
You wrote my name too.

2347
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:08,630
This is wrong.

2348
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:11,430
- No one else wrote my name.
- Let's begin.

2349
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,550
I give up at this point.
Se Chan, spin your roulette first.

2350
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,760
- Spin it.
- My name is on too many slots.

2351
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,430
- This is...
- Hey.

2352
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:18,930
Most of the slots are for Se Chan.

2353
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:20,370
It will either be Se Chan or So Min.

2354
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,470
Let's begin.

2355
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,210
If I get picked, it would mean
that I am very unlucky.

2356
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:25,580
- You are too much.
- Here I go.

2357
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:26,630
- Suk Jin.
- Okay.

2358
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,250
- One,
- Okay.

2359
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,510
- two,
- Please.

2360
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:30,550
three.

2361
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:31,750
- Please.
- It will be funny...

2362
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,750
if Jae Suk gets picked.

2363
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,420
- His name is on one slot.
- It will be the worst situation.

2364
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,590
- It will be funny.
- You will be the unluckiest man.

2365
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:37,660
It will be the worst situation.

2366
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:39,510
I think it's you.

2367
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:40,660
- It's So Min.
- No.

2368
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:42,050
- It's So Min.
- No.

2369
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:43,090
I think it's you.

2370
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:44,160
- It's So Min.
- No.

2371
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,330
- So Min.
- So Min.

2372
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:50,060
(So Min gets picked.)

2373
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,040
So Min.

2374
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,730
(So Min gets picked
with Se Chan's slots on both sides.)

2375
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:55,230
- Please put one sticker.
- Really?

2376
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:57,170
- All right!
- How many stickers will there be?

2377
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:58,970
There will be seven stickers.

2378
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:00,040
My goodness.

2379
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:03,210
So Min, I put your name
on the right spot.

2380
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,770
My slot was right next to it.

2381
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:05,810
(The first penalty sticker
goes to So Min.)

2382
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:07,550
Many penalty stickers
will be distributed today.

2383
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,790
Seriously.

2384
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:10,340
Seriously.
A total of seven penalty stickers.

2385
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,120
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2386
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,290
It will be bad
if he doesn't get chosen.

2387
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:16,430
- Most of them are for Jae Suk.
- Here I go.

2388
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:17,630
(Jae Suk's roulette is covered
in Suk Jin's name.)

2389
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:19,350
He wrote my name on every slot.

2390
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:21,170
Someone might get
two penalty stickers today.

2391
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:23,430
- Please don't let it be me.
- No!

2392
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:25,340
(What will be the result?)

2393
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:26,590
(Suk Jin, Jae Suk,
Haha, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan)

2394
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:28,760
Please don't let it be me.

2395
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,800
(Ji Suk Jin)

2396
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,730
(Suk Jin gets picked.)

2397
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,010
(Of course.)

2398
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:35,270
Congratulations.

2399
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:37,270
Let's go.

2400
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:38,680
- I hope this spot gets picked.
- Okay.

2401
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,940
I hope this spot gets picked.

2402
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:40,980
- Suk Jin.
- This spot.

2403
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:43,940
- Please.
- Let's go.

2404
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:45,980
- We should put them all together.
- Right.

2405
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:48,220
(Suk Jin's roulette has
many slots with Jae Suk's name.)

2406
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:50,680
(Suk Jin's Roulette: Suk Jin 12,
Jae Suk 9, Jong Kook 3)

2407
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,500
(Haha, Ji Hyo 1, So Min, Se Chan 1)

2408
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,680
It sounds funny.

2409
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,420
Ji Suk Jin!

2410
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,520
(Ji Suk Jin)

2411
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,390
- It could've been me.
- It's Ji Suk Jin.

2412
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,630
That was so close.

2413
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:19,220
Suk Jin is penetrating his way up.

2414
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,560
I think I'll be next.

2415
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,190
(He got 2 stickers in an instant.)

2416
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:24,690
He's in the lead.

2417
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,510
- Gosh, it could've been you.
- He's taking the lead.

2418
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,010
- It's my turn.
- All right.

2419
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:30,340
- It's Haha. That's...
- I know.

2420
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,010
Seriously, this is...

2421
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:33,250
Spin the roulette.

2422
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,400
He wrote your name a lot.

2423
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,110
(Haha's Roulette:
Haha 9, Jae Suk 7, So Min 6)

2424
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:38,110
It doesn't make any sound.

2425
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:39,250
This is so annoying.

2426
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,610
(Haha, Jae Suk, and So Min have
similar chances of winning.)

2427
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,480
It doesn't make any sound.

2428
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,610
Darn it!

2429
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:48,130
(It's Haha.)

2430
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:49,550
(He got himself a sticker.)

2431
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,890
- Great.
- It's Haha!

2432
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:55,630
- I can't believe this.
- This is nice.

2433
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:56,970
(Jae Suk and So Min survived.)

2434
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:58,060
Haha.

2435
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,300
This is great.

2436
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,900
- I know. It's nice.
- Spin it.

2437
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,100
(Ji Hyo's Roulette: Ji Hyo 10,
Suk Jin 6, Jae Suk 5)

2438
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,400
(Ji Hyo mainly focused
on Suk Jin and Jae Suk.)

2439
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,800
- What if I'm picked?
- I'm nervous.

2440
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,880
It makes me nervous.

2441
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,080
(Ji Hyo's Roulette: Ji Hyo 10,
Suk Jin 6, Jae Suk 5)

2442
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,380
- Haha!
- Haha.

2443
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,880
(Haha who had his name
on only 2 slots?)

2444
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:16,090
(It slowly moves
to Jae Suk's slot.)

2445
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:18,010
- It's moving.
- Keep moving.

2446
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,090
It's Haha.

2447
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:20,830
(But it stopped.)

2448
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,130
Haha gets two stickers.

2449
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:23,930
It could've been Jae Suk.

2450
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:25,390
- I know.
- It was so close.

2451
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:27,630
It's Haha! My goodness.

2452
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:28,720
Let's do this.

2453
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:30,690
- Please.
- Please.

2454
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:32,430
- Jeon So Min!
- We don't know it yet.

2455
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:34,600
- So Min.
- Let's go, So Min.

2456
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,510
So Min, please.

2457
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:39,270
(So Min's name is on most slots
of her roulette.)

2458
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:43,220
It has to be you. So Min.

2459
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,810
- It's Haha.
- Darn it!

2460
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:47,390
(It's Haha again!)

2461
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:48,810
(He gets picked 3 times in a row.)

2462
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,980
This is Haha's day.
Haha, today is your day.

2463
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,630
- What if I get Haha's name again?
- Your day.

2464
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:55,630
- This is crazy.
- Why did you provoke me?

2465
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,390
It will be amazing
if we get Haha's name again.

2466
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:58,720
- I have Haha's name here.
- This is the last one.

2467
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,020
- There is Haha's name.
- On this line.

2468
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:02,930
It all says Haha.

2469
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:05,500
Haha is the star of the day.

2470
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,300
- Here I go.
- This is...

2471
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,760
- No.
- All right.

2472
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,770
(But Haha has only a chance
of one sixth.)

2473
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:10,800
This is so...

2474
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,430
(Jong Kook's Roulette:
Jong Kook 12, Suk Jin 8, Haha 5)

2475
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:14,440
He wrote my name a lot.

2476
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,440
(Jong Kook and Suk Jin
are most likely to get picked.)

2477
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,510
Haha.

to get a penalty sticker?)

2480

- It's Haha.
- Darn it!

2482
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:26,980
(Haha)

2483
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:29,830
This is ridiculous!

2484
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:31,430
It's Haha.

2485
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:35,470
(Something unbelievable
just happened.)

2486
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:39,500
(They are all flustered.)

2487
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,860
Haha will be going.

2488
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,430
- Four stickers.
- My gosh.

2489
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:46,400
We have seven stickers today.

2490
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,010
And Haha gets four of them.

2491
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:51,140
- I know.
- Suk Jin gets two.

2492
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:52,980
- You shouldn't have upset me.
- And So Min gets one.

2493
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:55,110
Se Chan and Jae Suk didn't get any.

2494
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:56,650
Jae Suk hasn't gotten any stickers.

2495
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:57,790
I survived!

2496
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:59,460
- Jae Suk has no stickers.
- I can't believe this.

2497
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,650
I can't believe I survived.

2498
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:03,520
- It will be Jae Suk next week.
- This is a four-week-long project.

2499
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,300
So we have two weeks left.

2500
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,830
- I should hang in there.
- What should Haha do?

2501
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:09,300
- This is not bad.
- Two weeks later,

2502
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:10,890
you'll go to get a penalty.

2503
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:12,060
No.

2504
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:15,140
Let's hurry and split up today.

2505
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:16,800
- Good. Let's go.
- We should hurry.

2506
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,430
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- This doesn't feel good.

2507
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:19,900
- Let's go home.
- Good work.

2508
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,770
- Good work today.
- Thank you.

2509
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:22,970
Thank you.

2510
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:24,810
We might get 20 stickers next week.

2511
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:29,010
(Whatever Penalty Project
Status Board)

2512
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,810
(A luxury store is about to be open
on a rainy summer day.)

2513
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:32,010
(Elegance Yoo and Kim)

2514
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:33,260
(A luxury store is about to be open
on a rainy summer day.)

2515
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:36,460
(The store is filled
with expensive items.)

2516
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:39,150
(A clerk who doesn't know much
about luxury goods, Kim Jong Kook)

2517
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:40,720
(A countrified manager, Yoo Jae Suk)

2518
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,690
(I'll slash the prices.)

2519
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:43,730
(Hip Jiri)

2520
01:25:43,730 --> 01:25:45,890
(Next to it is
a trendy hip hop shop.)

2521
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,340
(A shameless owner, Ji Suk Jin)

2522
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,710
(A hip hop loser clerk 1,
Yang Se Chan)

2523
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,100
(A hip hop loser clerk 2, Haha)

2524
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:52,510
(Those who live and die
for being hip...)

2525
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:54,380
(are plotting something together.)

2526
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:55,510
(Hello.)

2527
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,250
We should do that.

2528
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:58,350
My goodness.

2529
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:01,090
(Ji Hyo is at Hip Jiri.)

2530
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:03,180
- This is...
- It's been a long time, Ji Hyo.

2531
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:05,260
- Come here.
- This place is hip.

2532
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:08,130
- We have new products.
- Tell me what you want.

2533
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:09,350
(This is expensive.)

2534
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:11,130
(This is Kanye West style.)

2535
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:12,130
(Amazed)

2536
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:14,890
- I like this one.
- This is crazy.

2537
01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:16,430
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2538
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,100
My goodness.

2539
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,900
(The clerks'
amazing sales ability...)

2540
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,900
(makes her open her purse.)

2541
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:23,800
(And So Min...)

2542
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,510
(loses her heart
to cheap fake items.)

2543
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,010
(How much is this?)

2544
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,180
(I'll make it 300 dollars.)

2545
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,720
(The pushovers pay big money
without a shadow of doubt.)

2546
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:36,250
Is it you?

2547
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:37,790
(A lady with a loud voice,
Choi Yeo Jin)

2548
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:39,420
(A lady with eloquence, Ok Ja Yeon)

2549
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:42,520
(The two ladies with loud voices...)

2550
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,460
(have Ji Hyo's back.)

2551
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:47,470
(A lady with commanding aura,
Jin Seo Yeon)

2552
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:48,800
(Refund everything.)

2553
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:50,640
The price is ridiculous
for this fabric.

2554
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,230
But why do you...

2555
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:53,860
(This is fake.)

2556
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,210
I'll make it 100 dollars.

2557
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,230
- That's...
- No.

2558
01:26:58,230 --> 01:26:59,600
I'll give you five dollars.

2559
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,010
Is your friend...

2560
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:02,880
(Is your friend a thug?)

2561
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:04,810
(The tough ladies conquer
the variety show world.)

2562
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:06,890
That's unbelievable.

2563
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,440
(Their spirits are...)

2564
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,440
(strong.)

2565
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,510
(Their bodies are...)

2566
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:11,610
(strong.)

2567
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,150
(The war of strong warriors begins.)

2568
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:16,460
(Be Strong For My Way)
