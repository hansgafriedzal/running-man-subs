- Yang Hun.
- Yes?

4

Put it on here too.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,530
This is crazy.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,330
- It's so stylish.
- It's Generation MZ.

7

9

Fifty percent? Sounds good.

10
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,470
Isn't this nice?

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,740
For the new products...
None of them looks new.

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,970
- About the shoes...
- Hey.

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,470
We should offer the shoes for free.

14
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,450
- They are like free gifts.
- What else should we sell?

15
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,070
They are only one dollar anyway.

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,050
(They are like free gifts.
They are only one dollar anyway.)

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,950
- We can get 50 dollars for this.
- This one?

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,090
- It's just a dollar.
- We should get the story straight.

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,680
We shouldn't say different things.
If it's down by 80 percent,

20
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,730
what is the original price?

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,320
This one? The original price
was 300 dollars.

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,670
Was it 300 dollars?

23
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,990
Let's sell it for 20 dollars.

24
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,990
- It's 20 dollars.
- I ran a clothing store before.

25
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,060
And the shoes are expensive.

26
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,030
Hang on. Look at this.
It says it's down by 80 percent.

27
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,600
People will buy it for 20 dollars.

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,100
I guess they will. We can say
it's an 80 percent discount.

- The shoes are over 100 dollars.
- All right.

34
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,010
Would you pay 20 dollars for this?

35
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,820
Just say Michael Jackson wore this.

36
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,850
- Suk Jin, why would he wear this?
- Michael Jackson...

37
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,350
We can say he wore this
in his music video for "Thriller."

38
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,530
This is expensive.

39
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,530
- You're right. It's pricey.
- They are designer shoes.

40
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,090
Let's say
they are brand-name products.

41
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,790
All these are brand-name products.

42
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,790

- They all are designer goods.

- All of these.
- They all are luxury goods.

right against it.)

- Exactly.

- Okay.

69

We should make it expensive.

to make profits after all.

- Ji Hyo, take a look at this.
- It's 80 percent off.

Michael Jackson wore this
in his music video for "Thriller."

129
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,170
- What did you say?
- You know the song, "Thriller."

130

at extremely low prices.)

131

How much would it be?

151
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,420
- Ji Hyo.
- This is 70, and this is...

152
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,030
- This is 80. So it's 250.
- Okay.

153
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,850
- It's 250?
- Yes. Just give us 250.

154
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,220
- It's 250.
- All right.

155

- This is not right.
- Nine and ten.

172
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,000
And 11, 12, 13.

173
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,330
- They are 140.
- It's 140.

174
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,960
So you should give me 110 dollars.

175
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,400
- Give me 110 dollars.
- That's not it.

176
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,700
- Give me 110 dollars.
- This is 140 dollars.

177
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,440
- I got 140 dollars.
- So it's 110 dollars.

178
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,530
- I...
- Then it's 250 in total.

179
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,660
Give me 110 dollars.

180
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,970
Two, three...

181
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,010
(She pays more money
just like that.)

182
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,300
Four.

183
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,580
Five.

184
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,410
It's 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,

185
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,450
- and 20. It's 20 dollars.
- It's 20 dollars.

186
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,590
Give me another 20.

187
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,650
- You don't have it?
- I do have it.

188
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,320
- Give me another 20.
- Just give me that.

189
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,480
Why?

190
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,260
All right. This is enough.

191
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,390
Why is it enough?

192
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,420
We just need another 20.
Put it in the safe anyway.

193
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,050
Give me another 20.

194
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,630
Then give me 10.
You can give me 10 dollars.

195
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,700
- Okay. I'll give you ten and...
- All right. Pick one.

196
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,860
- No. Not one.
- Are you done?

197
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,200
Here's your receipt.

198
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,030
This is the receipt.

199
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,230
(Crude)

200
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,510
Hey, this is...

201
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,470
In this IT era, how can you
issue a receipt like this?

202
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,210
- It's a receipt.
- This is what they do in Milan.

203
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,750
- Right?
- Yes. We do that.

204
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,880
Thank you.

205
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,950
And I'll pick two things I want.

206
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,840
- Just 1.
- No. I'll pick 2.

207
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,390
- Go ahead and take what you want.
- Hang on.

208
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,260
Now that she paid,
you're being mean to her.

209
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,460
- Why are you...
- Just go.

210
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,220
- Go away.
- He's changed.

211
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,420
He already got the money.

212
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,830
This place looks like a luxury shop.

213
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,960
(Elegance Yoo and Kim)

214
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,290
You look pretty.

215
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,840
(They offer quality service
claiming to be a luxury shop.)

216
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,090
- Me?
- Can you get me a cup?

217
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,460
- A cup?
- This is how it works.

218
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,010
This is really nice.

219
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,940
- It's pretty.
- I know. It looks good.

220
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,380
Here. Take a look at this.

221
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,950
- On this...
- So beautiful.

222
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,950
Put this on first, and...

223
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,110
try a jacket on this.

224
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,910
- So very elegant.
- You know what I mean, right?

225
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,760
- Yes.
- Look at this.

226
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,090
- When you go to a party...
- I love it.

227
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,390
- I'll wear it like this.
- Exactly.

228
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,590
That's right.

229
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,550
That's it. My gosh.

230
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,830
- You look great.
- I...

231
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,530
- You look amazing.
- I don't think it looks good.

232
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,200
I don't like it.

233
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,940
(Elegance Kim,
trying to humor his customer)

234
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,730
It looks perfect on you.

235
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,440
- I like this one.
- It looks really good.

236
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,030
Can you get me something
more colorful?

237
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,030
- Of course.
- I don't think it's right for you.

238
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,900
- That's not true.
- Recommend me some accessories.

239
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,580
Accessories for this dress?
Hang on a second.

240
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,340
This will go well
with what you're wearing now.

241
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,480
(He puts it in her ears.)

242
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,650
This is a headband.

243
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,110
You don't know
how to wear a headband.

244
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,960
- Is she wearing headphones?
- What about this?

245
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,280
Are you wearing headphones?

246
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,200
- It looks nice.
- I actually like this.

247
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,630
- It looks good.
- Isn't this nice?

248
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,900
I can go clubbing.

249
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,290
(Carried away)

250
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,840
- So Min.
- Yes?

251
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,400
Be honest with me.

252
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,270
- You're not buying it, are you?
- I'll buy it.

253
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,440
Of course, I will.

254
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,030
- I don't think you will.
- This is...

255
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,300
(She will try everything on
and leave without buying anything.)

256
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,340
(While So Min is carried away...)

257
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,840
So Min is in trouble.
We should stop her.

258
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,380
They are frauds.

259
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,450
- She got carried away.
- She'd give them her house deed.

260
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,910
- They should go to jail.
- This is ridiculous.

261
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,800
What's that?

262
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,010
So Min shouldn't buy this,
but she seems to like it.

263
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,740
- Too bad we don't have a jacket.
- By any chance...

264
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,710
- I want to try this on.
- Yes.

265
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,980
- Try it on?
- So...

266
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,040
- Do you want to put it on?
- No, it would be too much work,

267
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,310
so can you try this on for me?

268
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,620
- I want to see how it looks.
- Of course, we can do that.

269
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,220
- I'd like to see it.
- Sure.

270
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,280
- Trainer Kook will try it on.
- Wait.

271
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,220
- It would look better with black.
- Of course.

272
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,460
- You think? This one?
- Yes.

273
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,590
- Go ahead and try it on.
- I'll see how it looks...

274
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,150
- and buy it.
- Will you buy this?

275
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,550
- Yes.
- Me?

276
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,230
- You can get changed in here.
- Here?

277
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,130
How much is this?

278
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,160
- Which one?
- This tiara.

279
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,930
This is...

280
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,870
I'll be honest with you.

281
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,470
What sound is this?

282
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,510
Is everything all right?

283
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,950
Are these stockings?

284
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,580
- I think it will look good on you.
- Yes. I love it.

285
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,270
- So this is it.
- Isn't it a little too much?

286
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,980
It's like you're not
wearing any bottoms.

287
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,280
What do you think?

288
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,850
- These look great.
- They look nice.

289
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,180
- I know.
- You look amazing.

290
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,360
- I love them.
- You should wear them at work.

291
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,490
(He's impressed
by the elastic leggings.)

292
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,920
These are nice. What do you think?

293
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,500
- What do you think?
- I love them.

294
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,420
- Do you like them?
- Yes. I'll have...

295
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,420
these and the dress from earlier.

296
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,420
- This one.
- Yes.

297
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,930
- This is...
- And this.

298
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,760
- This one is pretty.
- It looks great.

299
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,240
I'll give you two scarves for free.

300
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,880
And it will be 300 dollars in total.

301
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,670
- Is it 300 dollars?
- Yes.

302
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,540
The leopard-print leggings.

303
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,220
That's right. This is a gift.

304
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,680
- She got me a gift.
- Right. I bought it for him.

305
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,510
- Thank you.
- Bye.

306
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,620
Bye.

307
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,730
(The luxury shop made 300 dollars
thanks to her.)

308
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,150
We made money anyway.
We managed to sell them.

309
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,420
She bought a lot of weird stuff.

310
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,760
Did you buy this jacket there?

311
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,260
Darn it. They fooled me.

312
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,240
I need to get a refund.

313
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,900
- I want a refund.
- You should. This is fake.

314
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,080
But the owners are
not easy to deal with.

315
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,480
What?

316
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,350
- Gosh, what's that?
- I guess someone's here.

317
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,900
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

318
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,140
Gosh.

319
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,780
(The one who knocked
on the door so hard is...)

320
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,180
My goodness.

321
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,490
- Gosh.
- Hang on.

322
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,490
(Actress Jin Seo Yeon)

323
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,460
(The charismatic scene-stealer
from the movie "Believer.")

324
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,920
(And her charisma continued
to the drama, "Wonder Woman.")

325
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,610
(So Min's older sister,
Jin Seo Yeon shows up.)

326
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,270
- Well...
- Gosh.

327
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,480
Why is Jin Seo Yeon...

328
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,170
(She takes a seat while
the owners are frozen with terror.)

329
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,770
- I...
- I want a refund.

330
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,850
- My sister doesn't like...
- I want a refund for all of them.

331
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,540
(Frozen and polite)

332
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,090
Why do you want to get a refund?

333
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,880
- Wait. Is your sister drunk?
- No.

334
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,830
Is your sister...

335
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,760
- Is she a thug?
- No.

336
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,260
She's a nice person.

337
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,100
Why do you want to get a refund?

338
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,870
The price is ridiculous
for this fabric.

339
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,290
This one?

340
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,400
We offered reasonable prices.
We even got her some free stuff.

341
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,130
We sold them below cost.

342
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,770
- Shall I take a look?
- Yes.

343
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,530
Hang on.

344
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,610
Why are you doing this?

345
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,620
(She turns the shopping bag
upside down like a tough girl.)

346
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,950
Why are you doing this?

347
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,910
- Wait.
- Why do you turn it upside down?

348
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,780
You can't do this.
Our products will be...

349
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,510
They are our products.

350
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,010
What does this have to do
with a refund?

351
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,090
You don't have to do this.

352
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,700
- I'll go through them.
- Okay.

353
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,000
This is from Dongdaemun Market.

354
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,870
- It's 20 dollars.
- Gosh.

355
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,100
This is from Namdaemun Market.

356
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,870
It's 18 dollars.

357
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,970
- What?
- My gosh.

358
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,430
What are you talking about?

359
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,430
This is...

360
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,580
- five dollars.
- Why do you...

361
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,640
- But, Seo Yeon, this is...
- Who recommended this?

362
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,040
I want to wear this.

363
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,170
- She really liked it.
- I want to keep this.

364
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,250
You'll wear this
when you go clubbing?

365
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,140
If you dance with a guy
in this dress, he will get grazes.

366
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,150
(If you dance with a guy
in this dress, he will get grazes.)

367
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,780
Why would she dance with a guy?

368
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,090
- I'm sorry, but...
- The fabric is not right.

369
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,050
When she dances with a guy...

370
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,290
Anyway,

371
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,730
I want a refund.

372
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,260
Then, except for this one...

373
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,700
Not this one.

374
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,900
And I heard you got leggings.

375
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,210
That's true.

376
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,530
- Can I see them?
- It was...

377
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,930
- my gift for him.
- This is...

378
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,770
- It was my gift for him.
- This is...

379
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,380
It's just that So Min is...

380
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,910
- Could you come here for a second?
- Sure.

381
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,220
She got hooked on this gentleman
with a nice body.

382
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,950
I think that's why.
My, you do have a nice body.

383
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,360
- Oh, thank you.
- Then...

384
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
- This one too. I'm sorry.
- Yes.

385
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,650
- This one too?
- She won't give you this as a gift.

386
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,130
- No, wait. I bought this for him...
- I'm sorry. So Min.

387
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,150
I bought it for him as a gift...

388
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,920
You shouldn't date a man
just because he has a nice body.

389
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,790
But I bought it...

390
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,100
(So Min's friend takes
the improv comedy seriously.)

391
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,370
- That's ridiculous.
- I gave him...

392
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,370
- She didn't go out with him.
- Don't do that.

393
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,210
- I'm saying that she's trying to.
- She talked about a sexy dance.

394
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,350
- I think she got us wrong.
- So Min saw me wearing it.

395
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,710
- But listen, So Min.
- Then just buy what you want.

396
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,040
- We don't...
- Do you like this dress?

397
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,310
- Yes, I like it.
- This should be five dollars.

398
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,780
So you have to give her 255 dollars.

399
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,650
- Did she say 255 dollars?
- Oh, I was wrong.

400
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,630
(Does 300 minus 5 equal to 255?)

401
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,380
- It's 295 dollars.
- I guess she's not...

402
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,550
- I guess she's not good at math.
- She...

403
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,020
- She's charismatic, but...
- Wait. Hold on.

404
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,160
- It's 295 dollars.
- She's not good at math.

405
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,560
Give her back 295 dollars, please.

406
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,260
- It's 295 dollars.
- But this one is...

407
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,370
Right. This one and...

408
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,880
- My, hello. Please come in.
- Yeo Jin is here.

409
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,300
- Ja Yeon is here too. Come on in.
- Welcome.

410
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,540
- Come on in.
- We have a lot of hip items.

411
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,640
- Yeo Jin, it's been a while.
- It's been a really long time.

412
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,010
(Actress Ok Ja Yeon,
Model Choi Yeo Jin)

413
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,620
Did you give the patient epinephrine
without a doctor's order?

414
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,380
(Ok Ja Yeon, the marvelous actress
with overwhelming charisma)

415
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,890
(And this tough girl has the members
in the palm of her hand.)

416
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,030
(She goes wild
once she receives a mission.)

417
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,840
(The girl crush-worthy lady is
perfect for Running Man.)

418
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,030
(The scammers are getting excited
to see new customers.)

419
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,670
- Was it you? Or you?
- What?

420
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,270
It's been a really long time.

421
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,140
(The palm attack)

422
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,400
- Why...
- Who are you...

423
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,900
- to rip Ji Hyo off?
- Calm down, Yeo Jin.

424
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,620
- What are these?
- What are you doing?

425
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,120
- What's wrong with you?
- I brought Yeo Jin here.

426
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,880
- Hey, Yeo Jin is here.
- These are luxury items.

427
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,140
- Why would you...
- This isn't hip-hop style.

428
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,780
What are you wearing?
This isn't hip-hop style.

429
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,990
We're not just selling
hip-hop clothes.

430
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,990
- This jacket was...
- What's wrong with you?

431
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,380
- worn in the music video...
- What's with her?

432
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,390
- of the song "Thriller."
- She got an 80 percent discount.

433
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,630
- What's the problem?
- Yeo Jin, why...

434
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,700
- You practically robbed her.
- What's this?

435
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,890
We didn't do that.

436
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,030
- You're wearing underwear.
- Underwear?

437
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,100
- What are you talking about?
- Underwear?

438
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,510
- What are you doing?
- Did you call it "underwear?"

439
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,800
- She drives me nuts.
- You know nothing about fashion.

440
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,740
Even my grandpa never wears that.

441
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,900
He's a grandpa!

442
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,480
- He's actually a grandpa.
- He's a grandpa.

443
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,770
How do you even sell clothes?

444
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,750
You must know nothing about fashion,
Yeo Jin.

445
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,350
- Yeo Jin.
- I know nothing about fashion?

446
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,780
- Just give me my money back now.
- Why should we?

447
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,780
- Give me back my money.
- Don't be ridiculous.

448
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,720
You already put it on
when you walked out of here!

449
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,280
- We can't give you a refund.
- You put it on me!

450
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,990
- It was a new one!
- We should do something about this.

451
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,230
- A new one?
- You made it a second-hand jacket!

452
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,230
A new one?

453
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,890
- This won't work.
- We should beat them up.

454
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,500
- They won't just leave.
- Hey, look.

455
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,370
- I'll knock some sense into you.
- Hey, guys.

456
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,660
- Obviously, it wasn't a new one.
- How could you push me like that?

457
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,510
- Hey, calm down.
- My gosh.

458
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,270
- Did you just hit him?
- Hey, call the police.

459
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,400
- We should call the police.
- I didn't hit him.

460
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,540
- We should call the police.
- This is ridiculous.

461
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,450
Listen. We'll give you back
half of the price of one item.

462
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,510
- Are we good?
- Give her a refund for one item...

463
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,580
and half of the prices of the rest.

464
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,540
- Gosh. She's practically a thief.
- That sounds good.

465
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,620
Come on. What are you doing?
Who are you?

466
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,090
- I'm an evil spirit.
- An evil spirit?

467
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,280
- An evil spirit? This is crazy.
- I'm an evil spirit.

468
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,380
- She's scary when she turns.
- What?

469
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,730
- Aren't you a Level Four spirit?
- You're an evil spirit?

470
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,200
- No wonder. The rumor...
- You look like an evil spirit.

471
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,360
- So the weird rumor was true.
- Right.

472
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,060
- The weird rumor was true.
- It was true.

473
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,160
We're not running a charity here.
We need to make a profit.

474
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,100
- They're acting like beggars.
- Here's our offer.

475
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,660
- Listen.
- A refund for the jacket...

476
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,270
and a 50 percent discount
on the belt.

477
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,580
- No. I want a refund...
- That's fair.

478
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,800
- for the shoes and the belt.
- Give me that. You saw it.

479
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,900
- Okay. Then 100 dollars...
- No. Just give her 110 dollars.

480
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,450
- Okay. We'll give you 110 dollars.
- Take it and leave.

481
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,270
- We'll give you back 110 dollars.
- This is the final offer.

482
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,880
- Fine. Give me the money for now.
- You have the money there, right?

483
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,540
- Give me the money.
- We can't give you any more.

484
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,680
- One hundred and ten dollars.
- I'll count. One.

485
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,460
(He skips again.)

486
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,130
- Hey, what are you doing?
- One, two, three, four, five, six,

487
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,730
- seven, eight, nine...
- He paused.

488
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,890
- Come on.
- Wait.

489
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,060
- Hey.
- Don't interrupt him.

490
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,600
- Here's 110 dollars.
- Wait.

491
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,890
You gave me 100 dollars.

492
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,240
- Just take it and leave.
- That's it.

493
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,870
That's it.

494
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,400
Then we'll give you 20 dollars
for the dress and the leggings.

495
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,580
- Twenty dollars?
- Yes.

496
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,430
- But our store...
- So...

497
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,980
- please give her 280 dollars back.
- So 280 dollars...

498
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,450
How about you take
those two pairs of shoes as well?

499
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,880
We'll give you that dress
as a free gift.

500
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,950
We'll charge you 100 dollars
for them and give you 200 dollars.

501
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,010
- We won't negotiate anymore.
- Then...

502
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,280
But...

503
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,960
- Give me 220 dollars.
- Okay.

504
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,360
- So Min.
- Seo Yeon.

505
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,290
- You should get 280 dollars.
- But...

506
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,920
You two must be a duo.

507
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,660
- She's good at fighting.
- Pardon?

508
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,630
- She's good at fighting.
- She's like a former gang member.

509
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,400
- So Min.
- Yes?

510
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,900
- Make it 270 dollars.
- The tone of her voice...

511
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,080
- I'm intimidated.
- She said 270 dollars.

512
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,580
- I'll come back without her.
- Okay.

513
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,170
- Come back without her.
- I'll do that.

514
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,910
So Min,
give this to the gentleman...

515
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,140
(Give this to the gentleman...)

516
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,040
Tip him and get his phone number.

517
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,010
(She wants to get
the shop assistant's number.)

518
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,430
Who is she, really? Why would she...

519
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,550
Oh, thank you.

520
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,760
- Text me, okay?
- Okay.

521
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,460
(Clicking her tongue)

522
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,900
- Gosh, seriously.
- I feel sick.

523
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,940
- Excuse me. Hey.
- I really like this dress.

524
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,970
Yes?

525
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,600
(Come on.)

526
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,560
- She's tipping him too.
- But I'm so offended.

527
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,370
Why do I get only 1 dollar
when he got 10 dollars?

528
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,340
- Please.
- I'll give you one more dollar.

529
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,010
- Two dollars. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

530
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,310
I think we're done now.

531
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,280
- It was a good deal.
- Yes.

532
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,420
We'll pack these for you.

533
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,810
- Right. We should clean up.
- We should clean up.

534
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,110
That was so funny.

535
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,990
We'll have Whatever Penalty Project,
Part Three today.

536
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,390
- I wonder what penalty we'll get.
- Oh, right.

537
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,730
- I'm stressed about the penalty.
- Today is an important day.

538
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,900
- I had a dream about it.
- How many stickers do I have?

539
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,030
Today's race we'll have
with the charismatic actresses is...

540
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,710
- Be Strong For My Way.
- Oh, dear.

541
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,260
Just as you did earlier,
we'll have a match...

542
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,530
- between Team Boy and Team Girl.
- I see.

543
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,340
The team that gets
more penalty coins wins the race.

544
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,220
The winning team can exchange
the coins they got...

545
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,270
for penalty stickers...

546
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,610
and put the penalty stickers...

547
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,460
on the boards of any members
of the other team.

548
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,550
You heard the rules
of the first mission, right?

549
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,190
The margin that the guys made
after selling fashion items...

550
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,090
is their mission fund for Team Boy.

551
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,900
As for Team Girl,
the money they got back...

552
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,560
is their mission fund.

553
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,530
(So both of the teams got
their first mission funds.)

554
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,600
- We got a lot of money back.
- Really?

555
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,100
- We got a lot of money back.
- Had she come to us,

556
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,870
- we would've given her a refund.
- We would've been intimidated.

557
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,370
She was so charismatic
in the movie "Believer."

558
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,370
- She's so fabulous.
- Indeed.

559
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,750
- We couldn't argue with her.
- So you gave her a refund.

560
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,040
- Yes, we did.
- You couldn't look her in the eye.

561
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
- I mean, her eyes...
- We gave her a refund.

562
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,610
- She's intimidating.
- Look at her outfit.

563
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,110
- She's really tough.
- She's charismatic.

564
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,490
- I thought she was drunk.
- Really?

565
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,550
As soon as she walked in,
she intimidated us.

566
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,230
As a result of the improv comedy,
Team Boy got 212 dollars,

567
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,320
and Team Girl got 358 dollars.

568
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,930
- Didn't you keep any money?
- We couldn't do it.

569
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,940
How intense was she to scare them?

570
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,440
She walked in with bleary eyes.
What could we have done?

571
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,210
- I see you had no choice.
- You should've kept the money.

572
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,910
- Did you keep your money?
- Yes, we did.

573
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,710
- We got more than 100 dollars.
- We made a big profit.

574
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,070
- I think it was 170 dollars.
- Really?

575
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,410
- Yes.
- You did a good job.

576
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,650
A penalty coin is 50 dollars.

577
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,920
Team Boy will receive
four penalty coins.

578
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,750
- And Team Girl will receive...
- Oh, gosh. I'm worried.

579
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,510
- seven penalty coins.
- Oh, yes.

580
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,810
- See?
- Gosh.

581
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,820
You can put the penalty coins
in the coin box.

582
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,730
- This is just the beginning.
- Right. This is just the beginning.

583
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,550
- We'll move after you get changed.
- Got it.

584
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,820
- Let's go.
- Okay!

585
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,060
Come on. Let's go.

586
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,360
- Let's go.
- I think I'll get a penalty.

587
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,290
Let's go.

588
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,740
I guess that's the case

589
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,510
You see, I think Ok Ja is...

590
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,270
- Her name is Ja Yeon.
- How could you?

591
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,840
Are you talking about the movie
"Okja" or what?

592
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,610
- Why would you call her Ok Ja?
- How could you call her Ok Ja?

593
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,220
- I'm sorry.
- That's not her name.

594
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,610
- It's okay.
- The way he said "I'm sorry."

595
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,110
- My friends call me Ok Ja.
- Exactly.

596
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,490
- I wanted to be your friend.
- Her name is Ok Ja Yeon.

597
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,720
- He wasn't entirely wrong.
- Right.

598
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,260
- That's right.
- I thought, "How did he know?"

599
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,090
- Of course, I know. I did research.
- Some people have such nicknames.

600
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,620
The name "Ok Ja" sounds catchier
for some reason.

601
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,900
- Right. It's catchy.
- It's more friendly.

602
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,120
- Yes. You should change your name.
- It's Ja Yeon.

603
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,830
- Gosh. You've crossed the line.
- What's your problem?

604
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,560
- Change your name to Ji Seok.
- Change it to Seok Sam.

605
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,940
How about "Hyun Ok Ja?"

606
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,070
Ji Seok doesn't suit him.
It's too cool for him.

607
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,600
Seo Yeon, I've been a big fan
since I watched "Believer..."

608
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,480
Stop talking about "Believer."

609
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,110
- This is the second time.
- Talk about something else.

610
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,870
- Talk about something else.
- I've been a big fan since then.

611
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,810
I thought, "My, why haven't I seen
such a talented actress until now?"

612
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,160
- I was amazed...
- And she's older than you.

613
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,320
Nonsense. Don't lie to me.

614
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,780
You should address her
as your senior.

615
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,020
I don't mind doing so,
but I'm sure...

616
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,400
- she's not older than me.
- How old are you?

617
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
- Suk Jin, how old are you?
- I was born in 1966.

618
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,000
"Suk Jin, how old are you?"

619
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,170
- She's good at it.
- She knows how to react.

620
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,400
- She's good.
- Indeed.

621
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,760
- Seo Yeon is good.
- Yes.

622
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,030
- "How old are you?"
- She's the best.

623
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,370
Seo Yeon went to the same school...

624
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,570
- Who?
- as So Min.

625
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,250
- They went to the same school?
- You mean, college?

626
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,340
- Dongduk Women's University?
- Yes.

627
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,220
- Hello! Dongduk Women's University!
- Do you know many of them?

628
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,450
- Broadcast and entertainment Major!
- Gosh. Stop it.

629
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,650
- Hey, stop it, will you?
- Student number, 20051756!

630
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,310
- Jeon So Min...
- That's enough.

631
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,160
- So Min told me...
- Practical music.

632
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,620
that those who were born in 1983
and studied the same major...

633
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,520
- Why did he stutter?
- What were you saying?

634
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,900
She said many of those who were born
in 1983 were so cool.

635
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,820
- That's right.
- Oh, that's right.

636
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,360
Suk Jin is close friends
with those who enrolled in 2002.

637
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,400
- Why?
- True.

638
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,970
- We just...
- They call themselves...

639
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,410
- Rainbow Seven Princesses.
- What?

640
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,640
- But there were...
- I know them.

641
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,100
- only ten of us called BF.
- BF?

642
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,800
- I heard about Seven Princesses.
- Including A Joong.

643
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,540
Kim A Joong, and I...

644
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,540
- A Joong enrolled in the same year?
- Yes.

645
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
Oh, I see.

646
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,810
Who were in Seven Princesses?
I've never heard about them.

647
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,190
Why are you asking me?

648
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,050
- Why are you asking me?
- That's funny.

649
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,580
- I just heard it.
- Who are your friends?

650
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,190
- "Why are you asking me?"
- "I've never heard about them."

651
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,050
- I don't know them well either.
- I think you're mistaken.

652
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,050
- Hey.
- I mean...

653
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,520
Seo Yeon really is charismatic.

654
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,700
- He stuttered again.
- That's funny.

655
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,360
- He's taken aback.
- Right.

656
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,100
The first mission is a game of wits
that Jae Suk likes.

657
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,600
A game that I like?

658
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,010
- Yes.
- Okay.

659
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,340
I'll give you a topic,
and you should answer quickly.

660
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,510
- It's Know Yourself Game of Wits.
- Okay. Great.

661
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,770
You have to say a word
that's related to the given topic,

662
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,650
and you should avoid
saying the same answer as others.

663
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,080
- But...
- I'm good at games like that.

664
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,420
It's similar to the game
where we hold the thumb.

665
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,760
Yes. But your answer should have
one more syllable...

666
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,190
than the answer of the player
in front of you.

667
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,820
- Oh, I see. Okay.
- That's easy.

668
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,900
- I specialize in it.
- That's unusual.

669
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,560
Starting with a 1-syllable word,
increase 1 syllable every time.

670
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,290
- Okay.
- That sounds fun.

671
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,900
- It sounds fun.
- That's interesting. Let's do it.

672
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,530
After you made it
to a five-syllable word,

673
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,470
decrease the number of syllables
from 4 to 1.

674
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,180
- Okay.
- Got it.

675
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,180
If more than one person speaks
at the same time,

676
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,180
if the number of syllables isn't
right,

677
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,040
or if the word is not related
to the topic, you fail.

678
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,650
And you lose one point.

679
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,840
- Okay. Let's begin.
- Got it.

680
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,770
Since it's a team match,
we'll tally the scores.

681
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,950
- Oh, right. It's a team match.
- We're on the same team.

682
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,110
We're all wearing yellow.

683
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,890
- Don't say the same word as mine.
- Be witty.

684
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,390
- Be witty.
- We're on the same team.

685
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,490
- We shouldn't say the same word.
- I see.

686
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,490
- No.
- We can say the same word.

687
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,350
- I'll give you the first topic.
- Yes.

688
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,660
How do you think
others would portray you?

689
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,700
Dung!

690
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,930
- No. We should raise our hands...
- Cutie!

691
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,830
- "Cutie?"
- Alluring.

692
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,200
(1. Dung, 2. Cutie, 3. Alluring)

693
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,300
Girl crush worthy.

694
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,030
Irresistible.

695
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,140
Magnificent.

696
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Intriguing.

697
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
(2. Gums)

698
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,010
- Gums.
- Mandarin.

699
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,070
- What's with gums and mandarin?
- What's with mandarin?

700
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,810
- As refreshing as mandarin.
- Why mandarin?

701
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,450
It's sour and refreshing.

702
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,990
Team Boy lost one point.

703
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,990
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Are you stupid?

704
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,990
(It wasn't related to the topic,
and Jong Kook didn't answer.)

705
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,190
Why didn't you say anything?

706
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,390
There is something about Haha
that's similar to mandarin.

707
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,820
- No.
- Right. I'm bubbly.

708
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,960
- You're more like a kumquat.
- Right.

709
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm the bubbliest
among all 44-year-old men.

710
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,170
So this is how we play the game.
It was a practice round.

711
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,520
Here's the next topic.

712
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,060
How would you feel
if you run into your ex?

713
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,170
- Spit...
- They spoke at the same time. Okay.

714
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,670
(They spoke at the same time.)

715
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,940
- Okay.
- Let's raise our hands.

716
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,980
I didn't say my answer.

717
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,270
- You said "spit."
- No.

718
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,600
- I didn't...
- You said it.

719
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,750
- Let's be quick-witted.
- Have you ever...

720
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,070
run into your ex-boyfriend?

721
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,010
- My ex-boyfriend?
- Yes.

722
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,580
- No.
- I have.

723
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,780
- I have.
- Me too.

724
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,960
- You have?
- Yes. I'll tell you what happened.

725
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,290
I acted cool and said hi to him.
Then he...

726
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,000
He saw me. He has good eyesight.
He looked at me for a while.

727
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,670
"Well... Who is she?"

728
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,060
(Who is she?)

729
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,560
- I got so upset.
- My gosh.

730
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,210
So Min, he must have been
put off by you.

731
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,800
- Exactly.
- Why do things like that happen...

732
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,210
- to her so often?
- I was so upset.

733
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,100
- Why do such things happen to her?
- I wanted to punch him.

734
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,370
- That's how upset I was.
- Were you alone?

735
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,980
No, I was with my friends.
He got even cheekier.

736
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,990
After he ignored me,
his eyes met my friend's eyes.

737
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,190
My friend said
that he had winked at her like this.

738
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,190
- Gosh. What's that?
- My friend said...

739
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,490
(Gosh. What's that?)

740
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,780
- That's so upsetting.
- What's that?

741
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,290
- He's a jerk.
- Right? Isn't he cheeky?

742
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,700
What's his problem?

743
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,290
Seo Yeon,
have you ever run into your ex?

744
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,320
- I've seen him.
- Right.

745
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,860
You know, you can recognize
a person even from a distance...

746
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,100
- after dating him for a long time.
- Absolutely.

747
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,210
I was about to open a glass door
when I saw him.

748
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,940
I turned around right away and left.

749
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,070
- You turned around?
- Yes, right away.

750
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,750
Are you sure it was him?

751
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,920
- Yes, I'm sure. I felt his energy.
- I bet she recognized him.

752
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,950
- It's better not to see your ex.
- Of course.

753
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,490
I had no choice
when I saw my ex-girlfriend.

754
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,810
- Really?
- You should've just ignored her.

755
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,350
It's what I regret the most.
When I saw her,

756
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,190
- You should've said hi to her.
- I was going to say hi casually.

757
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,960
- But I used honorifics.
- "Hello?"

758
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,190
"Oh, hello."

759
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,290
- I still regret it so much.
- That's so lame.

760
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,360
You know, right?
I regret it so much...

761
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,170
- that I want to turn back time.
- I know.

762
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,360
- You must've been upset.
- I could've said, "Hey."

763
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,560
Okay. Let's move on.

764
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,940
What did you hear
when you broke up with your ex?

765
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,370
(What did you hear
when you broke up with your ex?)

766
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,570
- Go.
- Get lost.

767
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,570
(1. Go, 2. Get lost.)

768
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,770
(3. Go away.)

769
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,180
- Go away.
- I was going to say that.

770
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,070
- I miss you.
- That's a lie.

771
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,370
I loved you.

772
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,950
(4. I miss you, 5. I loved you)

773
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,010
I'm sorry for everything.

774
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,780
You jerk.

775
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,460
- Right.
- Gosh.

776
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,020
- Team Girl lost one point.
- It's possible.

777
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,280
- Why?
- Okay.

778
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,090
- All the guys said answers.
- I see.

779
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,960
- Didn't we finish first?
- I didn't say an answer.

780
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,500
- Every member should say an answer.
- It's okay.

781
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,430
- I didn't know that.
- We pulled it off.

782
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,760
Next topic. What's the cutest thing
you can say?

783
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,970
Phew.

784
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,100
Bleh.

785
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,640
Hi-ow.

786
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,710
(Phew)

787
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,330
(Even "bleh" was accepted too.)

788
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,210
(But what does "hi-ow" mean?)

789
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,220
- She's so cute.
- Hold on. I have something to say.

790
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,720
Isn't "hi-ow" too old-fashioned?

791
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,010
- Didn't people say it in the past?
- What does that even mean?

792
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,960
- That's not acceptable.
- What was that?

793
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,490
- This is driving me crazy.
- Since I have a child,

794
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,080
the words "hi" and "meow" were mixed
in my head.

795
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,660
- "Hi-ow."
- "Hi-ow."

796
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,960
Can we try the same topic again?

797
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,260
- The same topic?
- Yes.

798
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,730
What's the cutest thing you can say?

799
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,140
- Yo.
- Boom.

800
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,900
So Min?

801
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,060
(So Min)

802
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,170
Purr.

803
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,470
- I missed you.
- My goodness.

804
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,370
(I missed you.)

805
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,180
- That was so funny.
- He failed.

806
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,770
- Suk Jin failed.
- Why?

807
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,010
- That wasn't cute.
- Why not?

808
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,010
- I missed you.
- Gosh. Hey!

809
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,070
- Team Boy lost a point.
- You failed.

810
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,780
- Why?
- That wasn't cute.

811
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,990
He deserves to lose 100 points.

812
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,550
- I missed you.
- "I missed you."

813
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,310
- Slap him in the face!
- Hey.

814
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,580
Take this.

815
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,120
Look at those teeth
with nicotine stains.

816
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,060
I hate the sight of his teeth
with nicotine stains.

817
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,360
Oh, gosh. That's so hilarious.

818
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,090
What are you doing?
What's with the pose?

819
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,830
- What's that?
- The upside-down V pose.

820
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,060
- I really hate it.
- I mean, he sounded...

821
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,640
- a bit weird and cheerless.
- I hated it so much.

822
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,600
"I missed you."

823
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,770
That was just weird.

824
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,270
Ja Yeon,
why didn't you say anything?

825
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,770
I can be very cute.

826
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,680
- I don't think so.
- Show us.

827
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,450
- Show us.
- Do all five answers by yourself.

828
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,810
- Start with a 1-syllable word.
- A 1-syllable word?

829
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,190
- Yes. Ready. Go.
- Ready. Go.

830
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,080
Um.

831
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Two syllables.

832
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,400
- Slap her in the face!
- Take this.

833
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,500
Hey, Ja Yeon,
why didn't you keep going?

834
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,470
- I can't be cute.
- Cute.

835
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,260
- Hey, So Min will show you.
- Let's let Seo Yeon try it.

836
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,940
- So Min will show you how to do it.
- So Min is the best.

837
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,830
So Min, say cute words
starting with a one-syllable word.

838
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,330
From 1 to 5 syllables. Ready. Go.

839
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,470
Oh.

840
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,530
(She starts
as soon as Haha finishes.)

841
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,870
(Baby sound)

842
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,210
(Acting cute
while making baby sounds)

843
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,710
- So Min is...
- My gosh.

844
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,950
- What's with the baby sounds?
- It was So Min.

845
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,070
Punch her in the face!

846
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,490
- What's with the baby sounds?
- It was So Min.

847
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,540
(Punch her in the face!)

848
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,390
- Take this!
- Behead the man!

849
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,660
Ja Yeon, watch him.
Seok Sam will show you how to do it.

850
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,820
Watch Seok Sam.

851
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,430
- Don't make me do that.
- Try it.

852
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,460
Give it a try. Show us.

853
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,820
(The prepared, talented man looks
for a camera first.)

854
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,520
- I don't think I can watch this.
- Oh, my.

855
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,900
- I can't watch this.
- Let's turn off the camera.

856
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,060
He found that camera.

857
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,060
- Ung.
- Oh, my.

858
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,560
- Let's turn off the camera.
- Ah-ing.

859
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,970
People will switch the channel.

860
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,940
(The guilty pleasure that catches
their eyes even though they hate it)

861
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,540
- What have you been up to?
- Die!

862
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,980
(Summary justice)

863
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,270
(Die!)

864
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,270
My gosh.

865
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,990
- "What have you been up to?"
- Die!

866
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,580
- Slap him...
- Die!

867
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,810
Slap him in the face!

868
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,490
Gosh, those teeth
with nicotine stains.

869
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,390
Those stained teeth.

870
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,090
I got my teeth scaled.

871
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,090
- Seo Yeon, give it a try.
- Those stained teeth.

872
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,060
- Which camera should I look at?
- From 1 to 5 syllables.

873
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,620
- Look at this camera.
- This one?

874
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,260
- Yes. Ready.
- This one?

875
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,530
Ready. Go.

876
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,100
Ang.

877
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,640
Kkurung.

878
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,650
(Kkurung.)

879
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,720
- Kkurung.
- Good. You're doing great so far.

880
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,840
Good.

881
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,840
Ho-ae-ing.

882
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,950
Four syllables.

883
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,080
Ppula-ppula.

884
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
Five syllables!

885
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,690
- What's "ppula-ppula?"
- It's like "kukkuruppingppong."

886
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,580
Kkukkuruppippi.

887
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,230
Those are all gibberish
that she would say to her baby.

888
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,500
- It's gibberish.
- It works every time.

889
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,970
"Kkurung" was so funny.

890
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,060
- Babies like such sounds.
- Absolutely.

891
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,000
- All babies like it.
- Ji Hyo, try it just once.

892
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,210
- Show us, Ji Hyo. One syllable.
- Ji Hyo, try it.

893
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,260
(Baby sound)

894
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,330
Two syllables.

895
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,330
(Baby sound)

896
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,480
Three syllables.

897
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,210
(Staring into space)

898
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,480
- I'm so cute.
- Four syllables.

899
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,070
(Unexpectedly, she keeps going
without hesitating.)

900
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,690
I am Ji Hyo.

901
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,780
Five syllables.

902
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,580
My name is Ji Hyo.

903
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,460
Jong Kook, do it just once.

904
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,280
- I don't want to.
- Just one sentence. Come on.

905
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
Stop it.

906
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,460
- Say, "Give me a barbell."
- "Give me a barbell."

907
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,320
"Give me a barbell."

908
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,620
- "Give me a barbell."
- Say, "Give me a barbell."

909
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,060
- Please.
- "Give me a barbell."

910
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,330
(Give me a barbell.)

911
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,640
(He demands a barbell
while clenching fists.)

912
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,260
"Give me dumbbells."

913
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,740
"Protein shake."

914
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,980
"Chicken breast, please."

915
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,840
- "Protein shake."
- My goodness.

916
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,370
- "The Smith machine."
- "Protein shake."

917
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,950
"I'll pump up my muscles today."

918
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,310
"Work out your back muscles."

919
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,010
Team Boy won.

920
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,080
- Okay!
- Yes!

921
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,490
- We're done.
- We won.

922
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,960
- Hello.
- Hi.

923
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,280
- This is...
- It says "Danger."

924
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,960
- I'll put it here.
- It looks like...

925
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,020
I wonder what this is.

926
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,320
It looks like a place
for an escape room game.

927
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,930
I wonder what we'll do here.

928
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,790
This wall reminds me of the show
"The Great Escape."

929
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,260
This place looks very big
since I haven't been here in a while.

930
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,010
I told you...

931
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,330
that the penalty coins would
play a big part, right?

932
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,480
- Yes, you did.
- Yes.

933
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,720
After every mission, each team will
receive the same number of coins.

934
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,780
Plan a strategy
of dividing the coins...

935
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,580
and then deceive your apposing team.

936
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,220
The winning team will...

937
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,620
have a chance to interrogate
two members of the other team.

938
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,000
After that, you can choose
two members and take their coins.

939
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,090
- Okay.
- No touching, right?

940
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,790
The losing team can choose...

941
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,760
one person on the other team
and take his coins.

942
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,700
- Gosh.
- It's a mind game.

943
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,440
Now, please divide the coins.

944
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Okay.

945
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,870
I'll hold on to my coins.
Consider yourselves informed.

946
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,770
We should let one of us
have all the coins.

947
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,480
- Right, we should do that.
- Yes.

948
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,720
- Okay. Good.
- We'll win.

949
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,810
- You're right.
- Which one of us should keep them?

950
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,810
- What should we do?
- Exactly.

951
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,280
Shall we choose the person randomly?

952
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,080
- Yes, we should do that.
- Let's play...

953
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,260
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

954
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
How about we...

955
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,260
play rock-paper-scissors to decide?

956
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,960
- Then one of us...
- Half-and-half.

957
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,290
(One of us...)

958
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,860
(One of the three of them.)

959
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,620
- Then one of us...
- Half-and-half.

960
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,170
and 1 of the 3 of them.

961
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,330
- That's a good idea.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

962
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,440
Let's divide the coins in half.

963
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
(One cast member and one guest will
keep half each.)

964
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,830
- Okay. Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

965
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,640
- The loser? Rock-paper-scissors.
- Yes.

966
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,510
- Me?
- Yes.

967
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,750
(Among the guests,
Seo Yeon keeps coins.)

968
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,270
- It's better than carrying it.
- Right. Let's do that.

969
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,280
(Ji Hyo or So Min has
the rest of their coins.)

970
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,160
- Psychologically.
- Psychologically.

971
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,390
- Seo Yeon?
- You can keep a poker face, right?

972
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,190
(Meanwhile, Team Boy has to decide
whom they should interrogate.)

973
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,490
Seo Yeon...

974
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,290
I'm sure they divided their coins.
They didn't give all to one person.

975
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,430
- They divided the coins.
- Yes.

976
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,470
- Ji Hyo must not have any coins.
- I think Seo Yeon has some.

977
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,640
(Correct.)

978
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,170
- But Seo Yeon is so intimidating.
- How about Ok Ja?

979
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,370
- Shall we pick Ok Ja and Seo Yeon?
- Right.

980
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,640
Ok Ja must be really smart.
She graduated from SNU.

981
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,180
But this is different.

982
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,680
Let's pick Ok Ja and Seo Yeon.

983
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,180
- But Seo Yeon is scary.
- We should pick So Min.

984
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,750
- She gets confused easily.
- Teasing her is fun.

985
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,770
So Min?

986
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,110
Let's pick So Min and Ja Yeon.

987
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,110
- Are we going that way?
- That's the best.

988
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,760
- So Min and Ja Yeon.
- We should get more coins.

989
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,190
Let them in, please.

990
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,660
- Did you want to see me?
- Please have a seat.

991
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,350
- Please sit down.
- You're walking lightly.

992
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,190
I guess you don't have any coins.

993
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,790
- She seems a little worried.
- So Min.

994
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,000
Let's not make this complicated,
okay?

995
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,170
- It's because...
- We don't have all day.

996
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,830
So Min, who did you give the coins?

997
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,170
(He asked
a straightforward question.)

998
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,860
(The first question was asked
so suddenly.)

999
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,210
- She's smiling.
- You must answer our questions.

1000
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,480
- Must I?
- Yes. Who was it?

1001
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,980
- You must tell us.
- Tell us. Yes.

1002
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,150
Ji Hyo.

1003
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,180
- Ji Hyo, right?
- Yes, that's what we expected.

1004
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,510
- So it's not Ji Hyo.
- So Min,

1005
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,110
if you tell us the truth...

1006
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,150
You said Ji Hyo, right?

1007
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,040
She touched her nose
while saying her name...

1008
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,690
and that's a tell-tale sign.

1009
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,460
- Me?
- That's right.

1010
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,490
You look uncomfortable too.

1011
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,280
- Do I look uncomfortable?
- Yes, it shows.

1012
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,020
I couldn't be
more relaxed right now.

1013
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,230
You're saying this is relaxed?

1014
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,790
- Normally...
- Your eyes aren't smiling.

1015
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,330
This is how I always smile.

1016
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,530
Your eyes aren't smiling.

1017
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,830
They sure are.

1018
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,970
No, it's just your eyes.

1019
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,760
Seo Yeon has coins, doesn't she?

1020
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,240
(Right on the nose)

1021
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,830
- I do not know.
- That's a yes.

1022
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,010
- That's a yes.
- Seo Yeon has coins.

1023
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,010
- There we go.
- Seo Yeon has coins.

1024
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,110
- "I do not know."
- Noted.

1025
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,950
- Seo Yeon has coins, doesn't she?
- I do not know.

1026
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,690
- Ji Hyo has coins, doesn't she?
- I do not know.

1027
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,010
Judging by how nervous she is,

1028
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,510
- she must have coins herself.
- Answer us!

1029
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,620
She must have coins herself.

1030
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,820
Answer us, Ms. Jeon!

1031
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,120
They may have given some to her...

1032
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,700
- thinking that we'd rule her out.
- Exactly.

1033
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,520
(The variety show detectives
squeeze her for answers.)

1034
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,640
(Either Ji Hyo or So Min
has the coins.)

1035
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,830
- Look at her.
- Right.

1036
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,140
- At the sound of her name...
- Why...

1037
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,600
Your mouth.

1038
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,710
- Your gums seem dry.
- She can't seem to answer us.

1039
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,940
- Get talking.
- Your gums are dry.

1040
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,040
- You should answer us.
- Why aren't you saying anything?

1041
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,480
This is no place to be cheeky!

1042
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,540
- What the...
- She hasn't been cheeky.

1043
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,250
This is no place to be cheeky!

1044
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,510
But she hasn't been cheeky.

1045
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,780
She isn't saying anything though.

1046
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,720
- But that's her character.
- What's with you?

1047
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,890
You're being cheeky and audacious.

1048
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,460
- Wait.
- What now?

1049
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,930
What the... Are you insane?

1050
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,020
(What the... Are you insane?)

1051
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,400
How did you know that?

1052
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,320
- She's crazy.
- We all know that.

1053
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,520
How did you know that?

1054
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,060
- I'm crazy, yes, I'm crazy
- I'm crazy, yes, I'm crazy

1055
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,910
So let me free

1056
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:32,910
That's it.

1057
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,680
That...

1058
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,680
(Jeon "Dam Bi" So Min responds
in a peculiar way.)

1059
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,830
- You're a good dancer.
- Of course.

1060
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,700
- You're quite the dancer.
- I'm impressed.

1061
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,010
You have your own style of dancing.

1062
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,470
- She's like a frog.
- That's something I like.

1063
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,890
- Sure.
- You know that, right?

1064
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:45,890
Jeon So Min.

1065
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,990
- Get out already!
- You may leave.

1066
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,560
- I'll get lost, then.
- Good.

1067
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,680
Gosh, this is confusing.

1068
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,450
Would they have given her coins?

1069
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,520
- No way.
- Not So Min.

1070
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,720
- Not her.
- No way.

1071
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,850
- So Min...
- I think Ji Hyo has the coins.

1072
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,100
This is nauseating. I might be sick.

1073
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,620
- Your lips...
- I danced for too long.

1074
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,560
- Your lips lost their color.
- You danced?

1075
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,700
(Jeon "Dam Bi" So Min
is out from confinement.)

1076
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,430
Even at the smallest movements.

1077
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,680
They questioned
the twitching of my fingers.

1078
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,370
(Who is currently holding the coins
for Team Girl?)

1079
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,080
- She...
- I'm sure Ji Hyo has the coins.

1080
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,140
- Ja Yeon, have a seat.
- Take your seat.

1081
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,540
She's already in character.

1082
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,390
She's already in character.

1083
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,390
- Hey!
- Are you already at stage four?

1084
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,580
Take your seat.

1085
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,260
Let's watch our manners, shall we?

1086
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,160
Right back at you.

1087
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,620
You had one person
take all the coins, right?

1088
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,330
- So Min told us.
- She told us.

1089
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,870
Is that what you chose to do?

1090
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,060
No, that's what So Min told us.

1091
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,100
Just answer this.
How many of you have the coins?

1092
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,470
- Does Seo Yeon have coins?
- Wealth and fame...

1093
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,080
- How many of you have the coins?
- How many?

1094
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,330
- Two?
- Give us a number.

1095
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,950
- Just tell us that.
- We split the coins...

1096
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,410
among the five of us.

1097
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,640
Do you have any of the coins?

1098
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,810
(Do you have any of the coins?)

1099
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,450
Hold on a second.
She just inhaled sharply.

1100
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,740
And then she crossed her legs.

1101
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,060
How about this?

1102
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,490
I'll say "yes"
if we have that in common.

1103
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,720
- In common with us?
- Yes.

1104
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,760
(What they have in common?)

1105
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,930
Does only one of you have coins?

1106
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,990
- Wait.
- This isn't right.

1107
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,290
This isn't how it should be.

1108
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,200
- I almost fell for that.
- How dare you.

1109
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,770
- I mean...
- Are you kidding me?

1110
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,410
- No wonder you graduated SNU.
- Is that a no?

1111
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,010
- It's a no.
- I do not know.

1112
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,010
Did you let the two of you
take the coins?

1113
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,310
How many of you have coins?

1114
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,470
We haven't even split our coins yet.

1115
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,870
- It's either 1 or 2 for them.
- I agree.

1116
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,080
- One or two.
- Right.

1117
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,910
- Two seems about right.
- Seo Yeon and...

1118
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,020
Not really.

1119
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,520
- Did you see her reaction?
- Listen.

1120
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,660
- Ja Yeon.
- One from Running Man...

1121
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,760
and one of the guests.

1122
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,120
(One from Running Man
and one of the guests)

1123
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,350
(Detective Kim is right on point.)

1124
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,350
I think they're getting to Ja Yeon.

1125
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,470
I told her to talk like a robot,
but...

1126
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,160
She's letting them get to her.

1127
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,470
- One from Running Man...
- One from Running Man...

1128
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,600
and one of the guests.

1129
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,100
- Seo Yeon has coins, right?
- I bet Ji Hyo has coins!

1130
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,100
(The fake detectives
corner Ja Yeon.)

1131
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,370
Who do you think has the coins?

1132
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,540
- Tell us.
- Not you at least.

1133
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,540
- Why not?
- Not you.

1134
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,310
- You don't have the guts.
- That's right.

1135
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,950
- You don't have the guts.
- You're a coward!

1136
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,350
You wouldn't have been able
to speak up.

1137
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,680
You and So Min, I mean.

1138
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,240
- Not the two youngest members.
- It's not them.

1139
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,560
- You may leave.
- Go!

1140
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,160
- Get out.
- Jae Suk's right.

1141
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,930
She's back looking like
a lost puppy.

1142
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,720
Your eyes are glistening.

1143
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,830
- Did they get to you?
- Were they harsh?

1144
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,160
- They must've scolded her.
- I know.

1145
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,520
Did they yell at you?

1146
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,430
- Because she's the youngest.
- It was split 4, 3, and 3.

1147
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,160
No one on that team is capable
of calculating probabilities.

1148
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,810
Gosh, it's way too easy.

1149
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,330
It's time to make your decision.

1150
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,830
- Already?
- Just like that?

1151
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:27,010
Choose the two members
who you think have the coins.

1152
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,720
- Seo Yeon.
- Seo Yeon.

1153
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,310
And...

1154
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,350
(Will Seo Yeon be caught?)

1155
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,260
- No, let's discuss this.
- That we should.

1156
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,580
(Sighing)

1157
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,520
- Who do you think it is?
- Ja Yeon.

1158
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,060
No way. I think it's Yeo Jin.

1159
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,160
That's out of the blue.
We never mentioned her.

1160
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,140
Seo Yeon and Yeo Jin.
Yeo Jin's one of the older ones.

1161
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,270
Because she's charismatic,

1162
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,660
she would've avoided
getting the coins.

1163
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,060
- Seo Yeon for sure.
- Let's get Seo Yeon up there.

1164
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,370
- And Ja Yeon.
- No.

1165
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,180
- Ja Yeon.
- Seo Yeon...

1166
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,350
- Ja Yeon? No, it's Seo Yeon.
- Ja Yeon.

1167
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,810
- It's Ja Yeon.
- No, it's Seo Yeon.

1168
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,350
It has to be the Yeon sisters.

1169
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,870
Seo Yeon gulped just now.

1170
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,180
- You're like that too.
- It means she's nervous.

1171
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,520
- It has to be Seo Yeon.
- I'm sure of it.

1172
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,020
I don't think
they gave her any coins.

1173
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,930
They would've seen her
as the easier choice.

1174
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,080
Can we choose two people?

1175
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,760
They would've seen her
as the easier choice.

1176
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,950
Can we choose two people?

1177
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,830
- It's Seo Yeon.
- The coins were split 4, 3, and 3.

1178
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,970
- Because...
- It's Ji Hyo.

1179
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,930
- Why is she not saying anything?
- Ji Hyo and Ja Yeon.

1180
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,490
Yes, Ji Hyo. I second that.

1181
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,410
- Out of the five...
- Ja Yeon and Ji Hyo.

1182
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,700
- No way.
- Ja Yeon and Ji Hyo.

1183
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,330
- One...
- Ja Yeon and Ji Hyo.

1184
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,640
- Ja Yeon and Ji Hyo.
- That's it.

1185
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,100
- Ja Yeon and Ji Hyo.
- Because at the end,

1186
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,510
- they watched their expressions.
- Ja Yeon and Ji Hyo.

1187
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,700
Ja Yeon and Ji Hyo.

1188
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,870
- Why?
- Get up here.

1189
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,410
- Hold on.
- How is this done?

1190
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,950
- Get over here.
- Unbelievable.

1191
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,990
- You're busted.
- Why me?

1192
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,540
- We got you.
- Why me?

1193
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,660
- I saw Ji Hyo's expression.
- Me too.

1194
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,260
- I know you're quick-witted.
- What's the reason?

1195
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,120
- But she could be faking it.
- I saw her.

1196
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,290
She could be faking it.

1197
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,720
Seo Yeon,

1198
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,290
we read your darting eyes.

1199
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,430
All right.

1200
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,790
Please take out your notebooks
and open them for us.

1201
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,910
- It's Seo Yeon for sure.
- If we're wrong, so be it.

1202
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,010
It's Seo Yeon for sure.

1203
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,950
Can't you see she's acting? Gosh.

1204
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,200
Let's check their notebooks first.

1205
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,180
All right. In one...

1206
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,220
(Does Ji Hyo have coins?)

1207
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,310
- Are we wrong?
- Two.

1208
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,850
Two.

1209
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,910
Three.

1210
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,060
(Open!)

1211
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,100
(None)

1212
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,390
- Nice!
- Yes!

1213
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,660
(Team Girl manages
to defend their coins.)

1214
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,930
Seo Yeon, right?

1215
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,490
I told you that it's Seo Yeon.

1216
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:30,990
- It must've been Seo Yeon.
- Seo Yeon.

1217
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,910
- I told you that it's Seo Yeon.
- See?

1218
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,040
- Seo Yeon and Yeo Jin.
- I said Seo Yeon and Yeo Jin.

1219
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,640
How could they be completely off?

1220
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,240
- I can't believe it!
- Seo Yeon had the coins, right?

1221
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,950
- I said Seo Yeon and Yeo Jin.
- Seo Yeon was one of them.

1222
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,240
Yes, Seo Yeon.

1223
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,290
Team Boy lost and won zero coins.

1224
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,790
I had six of the coins.

1225
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,890
(The correct answer)

1226
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,180
- And...
- See?

1227
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,490
- Me.
- It was Seo Yeon.

1228
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,720
And I had four of them.

1229
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,830
- So Min?
- So Min, my gosh.

1230
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,100
Why didn't you listen to me?

1231
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,540
The losing team will now choose
one person from the opposing team.

1232
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,770
We only get to choose
one person, right?

1233
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,470
We could've answered correctly.

1234
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,040
- Why are they...
- What's with Haha?

1235
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,310
His eyes say everything.

1236
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,700
(Who on Team Boy
has the most coins?)

1237
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,620
We should go for anyone
who most likely has any coins,

1238
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,740
- and that is Suk Jin.
- Okay.

1239
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,580
- We only get to choose one.
- Okay.

1240
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,620
Team Girl, please choose one
from the opposing team.

1241
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,020
One, two, three.

1242
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,290
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1243
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:30,020
(They choose Suk Jin.)

1244
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,770
- He could be acting.
- He may not have any.

1245
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,220
- This could be an act.
- Get up there.

1246
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,560
- It must be Jae Suk.
- I think we got him.

1247
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,140
Why did we even bother?

1248
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,310
It was all for nothing.

1249
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,310
(Could Suk Jin have the coins
even though he's putting on an act?)

1250
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,010
How many do you have?

1251
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,410
In 1, 2, 3.

1252
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,410
(Open)

1253
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,240
Suk Jin didn't have
any of the coins.

1254
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,580
(Suk Jin has 0 coins)

1255
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,160
(Team Girl fails to obtain
any coins.)

1256
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,220
We chose...

1257
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,790
- Haha.
- It was me.

1258
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,270
(Haha who put on a show
had all 10 coins.)

1259
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,470
- All ten?
- We let him have all of them.

1260
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,660
Yes, all ten.

1261
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,470
This next game combines
Speak With Your Actions...

1262
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,200
and Cry in Silence.

1263
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,910
It's Act in Silence.

1264
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,640
- Sounds like fun.
- Speak in Silence?

1265
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,010
After seeing the title
of the TV series or the movie,

1266
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,410
you will explain it
with just your actions.

1267
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,870
(Gosh)

1268
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,040
- What the...
- And...

1269
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,390
- What was that?
- Seriously?

1270
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,180
Are you reacting that way
just because it's Hyung In?

1271
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,490
- It's not like that.
- Enough is enough.

1272
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,350
To the next person? Goodness.

1273
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,760
The next person will guess
which TV series or movie it is...

1274
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,720
and yell a key line...

1275
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,140
to the next person in line
while wearing headphones.

1276
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,930
If the last person in line
guesses the title correctly,

1277
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,600
you will win one point.

1278
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,830
- Gosh.
- This...

1279
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,100
- Can the lines be repeated?
- Of course.

1280
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,010
- Then...
- We'll have to stay focused.

1281
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,180
- This...
- It sounds hard.

1282
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,350
- We must know many titles too.
- Right.

1283
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,540
I'm not good with titles though.

1284
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,290
I've watched a lot of movies.

1285
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,080
- I'm bad with titles.
- The three of us.

1286
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,620
Each team will get three minutes,

1287
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,060
- so score more points to win.
- Okay.

1288
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,060
- Sounds easy enough.
- The men will go first.

1289
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,560
- Okay, good.
- We got it.

1290
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,020
I'd love to get an idea
of what we're facing,

1291
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,520
but we've been asked to go first.

1292
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,490
- Se Chan knows a lot.
- Really?

1293
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,660
- He's knowledgeable.
- I see.

1294
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,040
He knows a lot of lines as well.

1295
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,140
- First, we should...
- Who wants to guess?

1296
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,410
Shouldn't you be the one to guess?

1297
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,930
The one guessing must know
a lot of the movies and series.

1298
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,870
- The same goes for the others.
- The lines for me, actions for you.

1299
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,870
- Se Chan will relay the title.
- Got it.

1300
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,450
Will there be a strategy?

1301
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,290
- Of course.
- So for Korean movies...

1302
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,720
We'll bow for Korean movies...

1303
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,950
and do the okay sign
for foreign movies.

1304
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,760
- Okay.
- This for foreign movies.

1305
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,060
- This for Korean movies.
- Right.

1306
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,490
- This for Korean movies.
- Korean movies.

1307
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,700
- Okay.
- Okay, that seems good enough.

1308
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,990
That much we should agree on.

1309
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,120
The right ear.

1310
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,330
- Just the right?
- Yes.

1311
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,370
The right.

1312
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:54,270
(Music playing)

1313
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,270
- Right.
- Like this.

1314
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,580
I can't hear a thing.

1315
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,020
- Jae Suk.
- The song is playing.

1316
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,870
Why?

1317
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,290
- I already can't hear clearly.
- What's the matter?

1318
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,260
- Jae Suk, can you hear?
- Yes?

1319
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,930
Turn up the volume for him.

1320
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,850
Turn up the volume for Jae Suk.

1321
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,490
It's playing now.

1322
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,770
Should we guess movie titles
over there?

1323
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,720
- Yes. The titles.
- Movie or drama titles.

1324
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,930
Drama titles?

1325
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,310
- Famous movie or drama titles.
- Movie or drama titles.

1326
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,700
Jae Suk, it's movie
or drama titles.

1327
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,100
There are drama titles too.

1328
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,970
There are drama titles too.

1329
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,100
I can't hear you.

1330
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,180
There are drama titles too.

1331
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:36,520
What?

1332
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,970
There are drama titles too.

1333
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,990
- Drama?
- Yes. Movie or drama titles.

1334
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,290
Movie and drama?

1335
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:42,990
You can take them out to listen.

1336
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,790
- Drama.
- What did you say?

1337
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,160
There are drama titles too.

1338
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,830
- I can't hear you.
- There are drama titles too.

1339
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,060
Get ready.

1340
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,790
Go.

1341
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,370
(The first question is revealed.)

1342
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,830
(Do I have the face of a king?)

1343
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,200
Yes. A famous line like this.

1344
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,540
(Se Chan has to explain
with action.)

1345
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,740
(Looking at one's face,
"The Face Reader!")

1346
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,020
- "Iron Man?"
- He's good.

1347
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,220
- "Iron Man?", "The Mask?"
- Se Chan is good.

1348
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,680
(It's a Korean movie.)

1349
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,810
A Korean movie?

1350
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,450
A foreign movie? A Korean movie?

1351
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,660
The face? What's that?

1352
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,560
What's with the face?

1353
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,950
"It's amazing."

1354
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,390
"It's amazing."

1355
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,600
(Changing from "The Face Reader"
into "Nameless Gangster")

1356
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,990
"It's amazing."

1357
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,370
"It's amazing."

1358
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,430
- I see.
- "It's amazing."

1359
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,240
What's that?

1360
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,580
I see.

1361
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,740
What's that?

1362
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,120
(Suk Jin mistook it as "Nameless
Gangster: Rules Of The Time" too.)

1363
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
What's that?

1364
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,160
- That's where it goes...
- Wrong again.

1365
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,020
(Staring)

1366
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,790
- Hey.
- Let go of me.

1367
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,890
(Haha has no idea.)

1368
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,060
(It's a Korean movie.)

1369
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,330
He has to speak.

1370
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,680
- Hold on.
- He can speak.

1371
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,580
You should say the line.

1372
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,910
You should say it.

1373
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,740
(It's a mess.)

1374
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,990
"Look here."

1375
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,810
"Do I have the face of a king?"

1376
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,430
(It went wrong in the middle,
but he mysteriously got it right.)

1377
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,020
- Is it this one?
- "Do I have the face of a king?"

1378
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,290
Can I say the answer?

1379
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,700
"The Face Reader?"

1380
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,620
"The Face Reader?"

1381
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,160
(Incorrect?)

1382
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,140
- He cheated.
- Why?

1383
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,270
- What? It's not?
- He used his hands.

1384
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:42,580
- He knows.
- What is it?

1385
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,080
You can't use your hands
when you say the line.

1386
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,200
You should say the line only.

1387
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,410
Should I say the line only?

1388
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,770
He should only speak?

1389
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,040
You should just speak.

1390
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,290
- I could read your lips.
- I did it like that after that.

1391
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,810
It's that one.
The one with Choi Min Sik.

1392
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:57,020
No. It's "The Face Reader."

1393
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,430
- It's "The Face Reader."
- Is it "The Face Reader?"

1394
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,660
This was not "It's amazing."

1395
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,330
It was the face reading.

1396
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,700
- It's because of the gesture.
- He said "It's amazing."

1397
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,220
- When did I do it like this?
- I thought it was that.

1398
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,700
- So...
- "It's amazing."

1399
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,060
- It's not this one.
- "It's amazing."

1400
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,060
If it's "The Face Reader..."

1401
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,060
- I didn't know.
- you should point at your face.

1402
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,040
- "It's amazing."
- Come on.

1403
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,930
- We should switch.
- Okay. Come here.

1404
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,200
- I got it.
- You got it, right?

1405
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,950
- It was easy.
- You should say the line.

1406
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,310
Ready. Go.

1407
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,770
Go.

1408
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,220
("Extreme Job")

1409
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,680
(There was no flavor like this.)

1410
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,290
(Is this galbi or chicken?
This is Suwon Big Galbi Chicken.)

1411
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,790
- This is Suwon Big Galbi Chicken.
- This is so hard.

1412
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:29,890
This is so hard.

1413
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,450
- It's hard.
- How can he explain with his body?

1414
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,680
(The line is easy, but the action
isn't easy for this movie.)

1415
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,660
(Explaining the fried chicken)

1416
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,370
What's the famous line?

1417
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,430
"There was no chicken like this."

1418
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,240
(A scene where he takes an order
on the phone)

1419
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,140
The famous line. Okay.

1420
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,620
I know what it is.

1421
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,120
The Suwon Big Galbi thing.

1422
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,180
(He exactly got
the Big Galbi Chicken!)

1423
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,790
Suwon Big Galbi.

1424
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,970
Can I have Suwon Big Galbi?

1425
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,160
- What's the action?
- Suwon Big Galbi.

1426
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,790
I know it.

1427
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,540
He knows?

1428
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,310
(Frying the chicken)

1429
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,040
(Taking an order)

1430
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,870
(There you go!)

1431
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:36,260
"It can't get better than..."

1432
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,850
- What was it?
- Hey.

1433
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,430
(The professional mistaker
appears again.)

1434
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,830
- You said you got it.
- "There was..."

1435
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,790
- You said you got it.
- "There is..."

1436
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,620
"no better chicken." You know it.

1437
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,740
- Louder.
- "There was no better chicken."

1438
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,970
"To your taste..."

1439
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,470
"There was no..."

1440
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,410
- "There's no better chicken."
- "Is this galbi or chicken?"

1441
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,680
- What?
- "There was no better chicken."

1442
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,450
Say it louder and clearer.

1443
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,640
Chicken.

1444
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,540
- Chicken?
- Chicken.

1445
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,040
Chicken.

1446
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,740
- Chicken?
- Chicken.

1447
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,720
(Shouting)

1448
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,720
(Did Jong Kook finally get it?)

1449
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,720
"She's..."

1450
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,330
(That's not it.)

1451
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,640
"She's On Duty."

1452
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,470
"More than..." That one.

1453
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,770
- "She's On..."
- "Duty."

1454
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,560
(Frustrated)

1455
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,240
- Three.
- "She's..."

1456
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,100
- Two.
- No.

1457
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:35,040
He's on duty and...

1458
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,270
It's over.

1459
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:37,640
- It's "Extreme Job."
- Isn't it "She's On Duty?"

1460
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,390
- It's "Extreme Job."
- "Extreme Job?"

1461
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,240
- What was the line?
- It's "Extreme Job."

1462
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,850
(The harmful consequences
of watching American dramas only)

1463
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,580
"Is this galbi or chicken?"

1464
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,220
"This is Suwon Big Galbi Chicken."

1465
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,580
I thought it was that. But I thought
the title was "She's On Duty."

1466
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,890
I said,
"There was no better chicken."

1467
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,770
- It was similar. It was good.
- It was so close.

1468
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,430
We could get it right
if it goes well.

1469
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,790
- You should've gotten it right.
- Why didn't I know "Extreme Job?"

1470
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,040
- It's a pity.
- Try it. We can do it.

1471
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,200
- Let's go.
- We can do it.

1472
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,270
Go.

1473
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,640
(The third question is revealed.)

1474
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,100
(I'm going to have
a glass of Maldives...)

1475
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,700
(in mojito.)

1476
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,020
- It's hard.
- Action is easy.

1477
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:10,580
Action is...

1478
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,520
(Turning his wrist)

1479
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,020
(He demonstrates the massage
himself.)

1480
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,290
It hurts. I know.

1481
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:24,100
- But I don't know the line.
- The line.

1482
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:27,160
- It's the title.
- I know.

1483
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,990
But I don't know the line.

1484
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,930
(It's a Korean movie.)

1485
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,040
"I have..."

1486
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:42,580
(Empty Head cheated in an instant.)

1487
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,140
(I have something to say
to you guys.)

1488
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,310
- Did he do the action?
- "I'm going to make a charge."

1489
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,910
A charge against whom? What's this?

1490
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:50,810
L, O, V, E, love.

1491
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,890
(Turning his wrist)

1492
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,080
(I see!)

1493
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,890
I know it, but what was the line?

1494
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,600
What was the line?

1495
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,310
"I'm going to have a glass
of mojito in Maldives."

1496
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,370
(He said the line
after a long time!)

1497
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:09,870
It's the other way around.

1498
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,040
- "I'm going to have..."
- Okay.

1499
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
"a glass of mojito in Maldives."

1500
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,370
(Answer: "I'm going to have a
glass of Maldives in mojito.")

1501
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,370
- Isn't it obvious?
- Right.

1502
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,740
(The mojito guy corrected the line.)

1503
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,350
(Hold on.)

1504
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,040
"In mojito..."

1505
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,120
He can't remember the title again.

1506
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,790
- "A glass."
- He can't remember the title.

1507
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,160
The title.

1508
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,520
(That's right!)

1509
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,260
- Shouldn't Se Chan be last?
- Wait.

1510
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,620
- I can't remember the title.
- Hey.

1511
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,890
Wait.

1512
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,600
(What's wrong with him?)

1513
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,560
- Come on.
- Seriously.

1514
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:38,970
Hey.

1515
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,970
- It's Lee Byung Hun this time.
- He knows.

1516
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,330
- Yes.
- Why...

1517
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,540
- You must know it.
- It's that one.

1518
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,970
- Come on.
- That thing.

1519
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,350
(They're so frustrated
that they might go crazy.)

1520
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:49,950
- It's that one. Yes.
- It's that thing. That's it.

1521
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,180
- It's that thing.
- Mojito.

1522
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,020
- He doesn't know the title.
- It's that thing.

1523
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,740
- Incorrect.
- He doesn't know the title.

1524
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,990
It has four syllables, right?

1525
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,560
- Four syllables.
- It's "Inside Men."

1526
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,930
- "Inside Men."
- Four syllables.

1527
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,260
- Is it over?
- Is it not?

1528
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,830
- "Inside Men."
- "Inside Men." Oh, right.

1529
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,120
What's interesting...

1530
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,830
is that it was getting farther from
the answer, but it went back.

1531
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,140
- It goes back to the correct one.
- It's very interesting.

1532
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,870
But he doesn't know the title.
It's amazing.

1533
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:14,310
- He's so bad, but he gets it.
- Why do you not know the title?

1534
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,640
- Why did I not know "Inside Men?"
- Let's go.

1535
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,910
- Let's do a cheer.
- We got this.

1536
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,270
Get ready. Go.

1537
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,020
(The fourth question is revealed.)

1538
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,310
(The ones that live for tomorrow die
by the hand...)

1539
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,950
(of those living for today.)

1540
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,830
(The scene where he shaves his head)

1541
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,060
- I see.
- He got it.

1542
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:37,700
I see. What famous line is there?

1543
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,990
"I'm the mister."

1544
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,330
"The ones that live for today
don't know about tomorrow."

1545
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:46,700
Is it this one? What was it?

1546
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,430
"The ones that live for today
worry about nothing."

1547
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:51,080
"But those who live for tomorrow
have no worries."

1548
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,240
What was it?

1549
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,850
"The ones that live for today..."

1550
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:56,950
"The ones that live for today
would worry about nothing."

1551
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,350
"But those who live for tomorrow
would have a lot of worries."

1552
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,390
Is it this?

1553
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,520
(The answer is slightly different.)

1554
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,450
"This is bulletproof glass."

1555
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,450
Is it a bulletproof vest
or bulletproof glass?

1556
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:07,990
- I don't know.
- Bulletproof glass.

1557
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,720
You can't discuss with me.

1558
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,600
"This is a bulletproof vest."

1559
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,870
Is it glass?

1560
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,160
- "This is bulletproof glass!"
- He can't remember.

1561
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,060
"This is bulletproof glass!"

1562
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,810
"This is bulletproof glass!"

1563
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,640
"This is bulletproof glass!"

1564
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,180
(Laughing)

1565
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,220
"This is bulletproof glass."

1566
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,580
(The way he said it
sounds like a eunuch.)

1567
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,370
- "This is bulletproof glass."
- Tell him that's right.

1568
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,140
"Those who live for tomorrow..."

1569
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,080
"I live only for today."

1570
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,020
"But those who live for tomorrow..."

1571
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,080
"Those who live for tomorrow
would have a lot of thoughts."

1572
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,290
"But I live only for today."

1573
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,600
(The line changed again.)

1574
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,060
"This is bulletproof glass."

1575
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,100
- Gosh, what is this?
- "This is..."

1576
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,240
- "This is bullet..."
- Do you not know this?

1577
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,140
- It's driving me crazy.
- "This is bulletproof."

1578
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,830
- Do you not know this?
- The line.

1579
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,970
(Describing the scene
where they shot the gun)

1580
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,680
Goodness, what a sight.

1581
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,540
You must act it out.
You can't just mouth it.

1582
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,580
You can't mouth it.

1583
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,790
(It's a Korean movie.)

1584
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,020
There are so many scenes
like that in a Korean movie.

1585
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,600
Is it "Shiri?"

1586
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,830
- Gosh.
- What is it?

1587
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,100
What is that?

1588
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,330
- Oh, my.
- What?

1589
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,490
(Oh, that?)

1590
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,100
- You got it, right?
- Of course.

1591
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:26,910
There's a famous line from it?

1592
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,200
I'm not sure.

1593
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,100
You know, the one that starts
with, "I only live today."

1594
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,140
"You probably have another day."

1595
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,770
Oh, I got it. Okay.

1596
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,350
"This glass is bulletproof!"

1597
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,120
- "This glass is bulletproof!"
- "You see this?"

1598
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,580
"This glass is bulletproof!"

1599
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,580
Won Bin!

1600
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,790
- "Ajeossi!"
- All right!

1601
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,350
(The answer is "Ajeossi.")

1602
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,200
All right!

1603
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,020
You got me mouthing it, right?

1604
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,350
That one was difficult.

1605
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,370
(After Se Chan got the answer...)

1606
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:56,770
(Last Question: "Squid Game")

1607
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,200
(Okay!)

1608
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,930
(A real squid describes
"Squid Game" with his body)

1609
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,970
- "Squid Game!"
- All right!

1610
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:06,970
All right!

1611
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,580
- He's on a roll.
- He's so good.

1612
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,580
He's good.

1613
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,410
- Goodness, that was hard.
- What a bummer.

1614
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,740
I should watch more Korean movies.

1615
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,080
(Team Girl gives it a go next.)

1616
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,020
(The music is being played.)

1617
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,220
You can't hear anything at all.

1618
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,520
- Are you ready?
- We can do it!

1619
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,990
- Let's go!
- Ready, set, go!

1620
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,620
("Parasite")

1621
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:30,930
(The famous line:
"So you have plans.")

1622
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,200
- Oh, it's this one.
- You can do this.

1623
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,200
- Oh, I shouldn't tell them.
- Why did you tell them?

1624
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,410
Why did you?

1625
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,470
Thank you, Suk Jin.

1626
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,470
You saw it?

1627
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,680
You saw it? Darn it.

1628
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,870
That was...

1629
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,580
He's so funny.
What's wrong with him?

1630
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,890
- I didn't think she'd see me.
- Ready.

1631
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,760
I can't remember the line.
This is bad.

1632
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,490
- Oh, the line...
- It's "So you have plans."

1633
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,220
Why do you keep saying it?

1634
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,290
- She didn't hear it.
- Oh, my. What's wrong with him?

1635
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,290
She can't hear me.

1636
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,290
(Remembering)

1637
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:09,680
Jjapaguri!

1638
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,200
- That one's more obvious.
- Jjapaguri?

1639
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,410
Jjapaguri!

1640
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,310
- She can't recall.
- As long as he doesn't tell.

1641
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,680
- If he tells more, then it means...
- Jjapaguri.

1642
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,450
That's not a line, though.

1643
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,220
- It should be a line.
- It must be a line.

1644
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,040
You add beef brisket
to it to make jjapaguri.

1645
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,580
No, it's not about a recipe.
You should say it's famous line.

1646
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,430
- You're sharing the recipe?
- You're not supposed to do that.

1647
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:28,580
- You should say the famous line.
- Jjapaguri.

1648
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,350
You should say something like,
"So you have plans."

1649
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,830
- What's wrong with you?
- How can you tell the answer?

1650
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,970
- She can't hear it anyway.
- Why do you keep showing off?

1651
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,240
- She can't hear me.
- My gosh.

1652
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,970
- Why does he keep showing off?
- "So you have plans."

1653
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,310
Tell him to stop, seriously.

1654
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,410
My gosh, Suk Jin.

1655
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,560
What did I do?

1656
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,330
You love showing off.

1657
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:45,040
- Gosh, it's jjapaguri.
- Wait.

1658
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,240
I bet she has no idea. She turned
without knowing the answer.

1659
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,810
(What's the answer?)

1660
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,410
- It must be frustrating.
- I can't think of any. Goodness.

1661
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,520
- She should do the action.
- She doesn't know.

1662
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,220
- Oh, the noodles?
- She shouldn't describe that.

1663
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,620
- She should've done this.
- That's right.

1664
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,220
- Come on! Stay still.
- Stop that.

1665
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,220
What's wrong with you?

1666
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:04,100
- She can't see us.
- What do you mean?

1667
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,220
(She clearly saw them.)

1668
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,330
The eyes?

1669
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,830
She managed to see it.

1670
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,200
Gosh, Suk Jin. Seriously!

1671
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,700
It's impossible that she saw us.

1672
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,510
- Of course she can see you.
- How so?

1673
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:14,700
She can see you with her side eyes.

1674
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,600
She has no idea what the answer is.

1675
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,330
(I got it!)

1676
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:20,410
- Oh, my.
- She figured it out.

1677
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:23,080
It's all ruined because of Seok Sam.

1678
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,950
- It was like that from the start.
- It's over.

1679
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,620
I'm sure they don't know
the famous line.

1680
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,220
You're talking about this, right?
Hold on.

1681
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,490
How did she figure it out?

1682
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:33,080
- You're the one who told them.
- You told them.

1683
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,330
You told them.

1684
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,120
- Even if I tell them...
- That's great.

1685
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:39,220
"Ma'am! Make us jjapaguri!"

1686
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:40,930
Jjapaguri!

1687
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,660
- "Ma'am! Make us jjapaguri!"
- That's right.

1688
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,740
What about it?

1689
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,100
She has no idea.

1690
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,310
Or it could be...

1691
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,830
She should say something else,
like, "So you have plans."

1692
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,040
- Stay quiet!
- What's wrong with you?

1693
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,700
- They can't hear us.
- Put on their shirt and join them.

1694
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,970
They can't hear us anyway.

1695
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:58,970
"My husband is in the basement."

1696
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,390
- I see.
- They can't hear us.

1697
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,620
"Parasite!"

1698
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,890
They got it.

1699
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,700
(Thanks to Ja Yeon's clear
pronunciation, they got the answer.)

1700
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,350
What is this?

1701
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,270
Seriously... Come on.

1702
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:15,160
- They heard us? They couldn't.
- Well done.

1703
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:16,390
Next question.

1704
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:17,490
Gosh, Seok Sam.

1705
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:18,990
Didn't you give them too much time?

1706
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,600
Get ready, set, go.

1707
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,010
("Nameless Gangster:
Rules of the Time")

1708
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,770
(Famous line: You see!
I had dinner with your boss!)

1709
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,510
(Okay? We went to a sauna too!)

1710
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,720
- This one is difficult.
- We went to a sauna too!

1711
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,520
(He has many minions.)

1712
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,950
That's great.

1713
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,620
(She describes the main character
walking with his minions.)

1714
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,290
"Do I have the face of a king?"

1715
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,620
- That's it.
- That's it.

1716
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,350
- She's impressive.
- The one where he appears.

1717
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:43,950
- "Snowpiercer?"
- "Do I have the face of a king?"

1718
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:47,290
(She knows it.)

1719
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,330
- She doesn't know.
- Oh, I can't remember the title.

1720
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,600
Yes. As long as you don't get it.

1721
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,810
- You don't have to remember it.
- It's this one.

1722
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,100
"You punk!"

1723
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,740
"You live in Namyeong-dong, right?"

1724
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,310
- "I go to sauna with your dad too!"
- "You punk!"

1725
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,310
- "Okay? You punk!"
- "You punk!"

1726
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,770
"I went to your school too!"

1727
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:07,350
- Why would he go to their school?
- Choi Min Sik?

1728
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,020
Choi Min Sik.

1729
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:11,160
The movie, "Nameless..."

1730
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,520
"Nameless Friend."

1731
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,160
"Nameless Friend" sounds fun.

1732
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,890
I don't like "Nameless Crimes."

1733
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,970
(Actress Choi is doing her best
to act it out.)

1734
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,390
(Oh, that!)

1735
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,100
I got it.

1736
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,310
They know it right away
because they're actresses.

1737
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,330
- I know.
- I know. They know it.

1738
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:31,870
- "You still got it!"
- See?

1739
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,410
(You still got it!)

1740
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,450
"Nameless Gangster."

1741
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,350
(It's correct.)

1742
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:38,970
It's so annoying.

1743
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:42,490
I'm sorry, but let's have
Seo Yeon act it.

1744
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,220
- Let them switch.
- Suk Jin...

1745
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,330
I find this kind of behavior absurd.

1746
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,430
He told them all the answers,
but now that they get it...

1747
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,600
Why did you get it so well?

1748
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,430
You just need to keep your eye
on him. You'll get it fast.

1749
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,020
- Just look at his mouth.
- Is that so?

1750
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,990
- Then we'd be tied.
- We're tied?

1751
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,060
Let's start with the last question.
Ready, go.

1752
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,600
("Architecture 101")

1753
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,700
This one is hard.

1754
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,810
(How will she act out
"Architecture 101?")

1755
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,740
Oh, it's this one.

1756
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,140
But the action itself is hard.

1757
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,080
- But this is...
- There's no famous act.

1758
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,620
How can you act it out?

1759
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,120
- There is one.
- There is.

1760
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,790
- There is.
- The one that Cho Jung Seok did.

1761
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,260
("Rub it. Rub it hard.")

1762
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,560
That's right.

1763
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,160
That's it.

1764
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,020
I'm sure they'll get it for sure.

1765
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,200
- Do you get it?
- "Breathless."

1766
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,330
You're doing well.

1767
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,470
Oh, I get it.
I can't remember the title.

1768
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,470
- "Breathless."
- You know it?

1769
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:31,330
Oh, I see. She knows it.

1770
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:32,490
"Architecture 101."

1771
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:34,140
- No way.
- "Architecture 101."

1772
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,600
No way. She knows everything.

1773
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,080
- She knows a lot of movies.
- You should know the famous lines.

1774
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,950
But this isn't allowed on public TV.
Can I still do it?

1775
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:40,970
- Try it.
- It's one of the acts.

1776
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:42,140
I'm sure they'll censor it.

1777
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,220
"Rub it hard!"

1778
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,140
- No, only words are allowed!
- "Rub it hard!"

1779
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,720
(No actions!)

1780
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,620
- Hey!
- Only words are allowed!

1781
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,720
You can only say the words.

1782
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,220
What's wrong with you?
Just say the words.

1783
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,760
- I mean...
- The tongue...

1784
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,220
A snake.

1785
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,520
- Look at her.
- "Rub it hard."

1786
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,120
It's allowed. The line exists.

1787
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,100
- It's a famous line.
- It's hilarious.

1788
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,200
"Rub it hard." You got it, right?

1789
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,560
She's good.

1790
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,140
- She's good.
- She's good.

1791
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,100
- She's good!
- Seo Yeon is good.

1792
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,700
You've never kissed anyone, right?

1793
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:16,720
The tongues rub each other
super hard like snakes.

1794
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,240
They rub hard.

1795
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:19,790
They just...

1796
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,680
That's right. It's hilarious!

1797
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,620
- That's the line!
- They rub hard.

1798
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,890
- She's good.
- That's the line.

1799
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,930
- I get it now.
- Ji Hyo shouldn't have seen it.

1800
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:28,930
- Right.
- Right.

59:59,670 --> 01:00:00,840
A fly?

1801
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,120
That's right. She got the fly part.

1802
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,100
- "Breathless" by Yang Ik Joon.
- They got it!

1803
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,100
"Breathless" by Yang Ik Joon.

1804
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,770
Ji Hyo didn't see
Seo Yeon's detailed acting.

1805
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:37,770
Ji Hyo doesn't know this part.

1806
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,510
I see!

1807
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:42,060
- I got it!
- She just got it.

1808
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,100
- She just got it.
- You can't mouth it.

1809
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:46,240
- A fly?
- A bird?

1810
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,580
(Why would you rub your hands?)

1811
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,080
- My gosh.
- But it's a fly.

1812
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,120
Why is she doing that?

1813
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,040
- Are her hands cold?
- Why did she say she got it?

1814
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,080
- She's doing it.
- What's with her?

1815
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,410
- She has no idea.
- She's acting out a fly.

1816
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:58,080
She must've thought
it was "Breathless."

1817
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,520
You need to move on.

1818
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,220
- Turn her.
- You're running out of time.

1819
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,350
This won't be fun
if you act like that.

1820
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:05,990
Begging as if your life
depends on it!

1821
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,330
Don't tell me the answer.

1822
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:11,240
- Begging.
- No, tell it to her.

1823
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,290
You thought wrong.

1824
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,040
But Yeo Jin might get it.

1825
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,910
A bird. A fly? A bird?

1826
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,310
- Finish it.
- What's the answer?

1827
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,700
- Finish it.
- Tell us the answer.

1828
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,470
- Five, four, three,
- It was fun.

1829
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,770
- Is it a Korean movie?
- two,

1830
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,410
- one.
- Tell us the answer.

1831
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,120
- "A Fly?"
- "A Fly."

1832
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,120
- There's no such movie.
- "Lovers in Paris."

1833
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,680
- Seo Jin did well, though.
- Is that the answer?

1834
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,220
- It's "Architecture 101."
- What?

1835
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,620
It's "Architecture 101."

1836
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:33,950
What does a fly have to do with it?

1837
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:36,260
- But Ji Hyo knew...
- Cho Jeong Seok's character...

1838
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,060
But Ji Hyo knew,
but it became "Breathless" with her.

1839
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,290
- This acting...
- Oh, Cho Jeong Seok's character?

1840
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,700
The kissing scene.

1841
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,290
"Rub it hard."

1842
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,700
Your scores are tied.

1843
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,040
- We're tied?
- Yes. Since it's tied,

1844
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,200
- Since it's tied.
- let's play one more time.

1845
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,770
- Okay.
- It's about time you'll be hungry.

1846
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,770
Let's have lunch first.

1847
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,270
The female members will eat inside,

1848
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:58,810
and the male members
will eat outside.

1849
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,620
- Good.
- You can go around to ask.

1850
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,680
All right.

1851
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,890
I think it'll be something good.

1852
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,330
Let's distribute the coins first.

1853
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:08,890
How shall we distribute them?

1854
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,830
Let's distribute them randomly.

1855
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:11,930
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1856
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:15,020
If we do, they'll be so confused.
There'll be no strategy.

1857
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,930
- Or a winner...
- Point them.

1858
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,270
can give out the coins.
Only one of us can do that.

1859
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:23,040
- Then we won't know for real.
- He'll distribute them?

1860
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,140
Yes, he will.

1861
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,410
Just the winner
will distribute them?

1862
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:26,600
Okay. It's up to him?

1863
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,600
- Even we won't know.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1864
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,740
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1865
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:30,950
- Darn it.
- It's us.

1866
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,910
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1867
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,220
Oh, no.

1868
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,680
- This is fun.
- I want to lose.

1869
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,910
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1870
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,910
- Darn it.
- You go and distribute them.

1871
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,790
- We won't know.
- We'll be eating.

1872
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,260
- We won't know.
- We'll have no idea.

1873
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,720
- I should go eat.
- Only you will know.

1874
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,620
- Gosh, I get to distribute them?
- Yes.

1875
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,620
(Only Jong Kook will be able
to distribute the coins.)

1876
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,020
My gosh.

1877
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,870
I should go eat.

1878
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,330
My, what's this?

1879
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:55,410
My gosh, it's been a while.

1880
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,680
- It looks good.
- Rice will be so good with this.

1881
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,970
(A buffet of canned meals
makes a nice feast for the holiday.)

1882
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:00,370
It looks delicious.

1883
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,580
My kids love this.

1884
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:04,620
Thank you for the food.

1885
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,990
(They begin eating together.)

1886
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:09,450
(What?)

1887
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:11,310
(My goodness.)

1888
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,390
(Middle-aged men describe the taste
in a strange way.)

1889
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:17,660
It's really tasty.

1890
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,890
(They have a hearty lunch
for the first time in a long while.)

1891
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,100
I usually don't eat this much.

1892
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,100
(Jong Kook joined them
after finishing up the task.)

1893
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,270
- You don't need a sauce.
- You should eat this.

1894
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,060
You should eat this.

1895
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,660
- Good.
- It's so tasty.

1896
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,040
It's so tasty.

1897
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,470
What's this?

1898
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:35,810
Haha.

1899
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:37,640
Haha.

1900
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:38,950
Please put one in my bag.

1901
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,810
(Se Chan loves canned meat.)

1902
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:46,450
(He tries to smuggle it.)

1903
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:52,720
They will have to interrogate you
if they want to know the truth.

1904
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,890
(They forgot about the interrogation
since they were busy eating.)

1905
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:55,990
Jae Suk, you have been summoned
to the interrogation room.

1906
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,790
- Speak the truth.
- When you receive them...

1907
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,200
- Jong Kook, you are up.
- Me?

1908
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,770
(Jae Suk and Jong Kook
get summoned to Room of Truth.)

1909
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,930
- We outsourced the task.
- Right?

1910
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:05,410
Someone else distributed the coins.

1911
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:06,700
- We don't know what he did.
- Someone distributed them.

1912
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,370
You must be nervous.
You are shaking your legs.

1913
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:12,040
- It means you are lying.
- I am not lying. It's the truth.

1914
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,140
(Team Girl's interrogation ends.)

1915
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,640
- What's this?
- Tell us who you want...

1916
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,160
to interrogate in person.

1917
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:19,950
- We don't need that.
- We will go with our hunch.

1918
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:21,830
Let's go with our hunch.

1919
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,830
- Okay.
- Hold on. I have an idea.

1920
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,830
Let's decide by flipping a coin.

1921
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:28,600
- Shall we do that?
- Someone we picked earlier...

1922
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,160
- or...
- Let's do this instead.

1923
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:32,700
Let's write down the 5 names
and pick 2 at random.

1924
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,310
- What do you think?
- Okay.

1925
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,740
- Shall we have a draw?
- Let's have our luck decide.

1926
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:39,240
- We have no way of knowing.
- It's impossible.

1927
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:42,140
- Seo Yeon, Ji Hyo, Ja Yeon...
- Seo Yeon, Ji Hyo, Ja Yeon...

1928
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:44,080
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1929
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,120
It's the people
who picked earlier, right?

1930
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,290
You and Ok Ja.

1931
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,260
Ja Yeon?

1932
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,660
You can't meet my eyes.

1933
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,260
Okay. You got caught.

1934
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,560
I think it really is them.
Ja Yeon and Ok Ja.

1935
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:57,600
Hold on.

1936
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:59,760
Ok Ja is Ja Yeon.

1937
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,970
- Ok Ja and Ji Hyo.
- Aren't Ok Ja and Ja Yeon the same?

1938
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:05,160
I think it really is
Ok Ja and Ji Hyo.

1939
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,410
Okay. Let's go.

1940
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:09,040
- Okay.
- Let's have a draw.

1941
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,270
- Okay.
- Throw them in the air.

1942
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:11,810
- Let's ask them to pick.
- Hey.

1943
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:13,180
- So Min.
- Pick one.

1944
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,580
- So Min, pick 2.
- Pick 1.

1945
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,680
We will pick those people.

1946
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,450
- Two.
- Okay. Give them to me.

1947
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:18,540
Give them to me.

1948
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,890
- Who are they?
- So Min.

1949
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,290
(The result is So Min and...)

1950
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:24,310
- It isn't So Min.
- Ji Hyo.

1951
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:26,120
- Okay.
- No.

1952
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,680
- They don't have the coins.
- Just go with them.

1953
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,790
- Come on.
- They don't have the coins.

1954
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,260
- Let's exclude the two of them.
- Exclude them.

1955
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,290
They don't have the coins.
Listen to me.

1956
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:34,370
- I think it's So Min.
- There is no way she has the coins.

1957
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,200
- Just go with the two of them.
- They don't have the coins.

1958
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,560
- We agreed to do that.
- Let's pick two ourselves.

1959
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,970
Why did you make her pick two?

1960
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:40,930
- Why did you make her pick two?
- Seriously.

1961
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,040
- Ji Hyo and Ok Ja.
- Here. Pick two.

1962
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,740
- I will pick 1.
- Here. Pick 1.

1963
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,870
Let's see.

1964
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:48,140
- Seo Yeon.
- Ja Yeon.

1965
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,450
- I am sorry, but...
- Ja Yeon.

1966
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,350
(Seo Yeon and Ja Yeon?)

1967
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:55,310
I am sorry, but you will keep going
until you get what you want.

1968
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,990
- This won't end.
- Whose names do you want?

1969
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,890
You will keep going
until you get what you want.

1970
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:00,350
We should go with the first picks.

1971
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,720
I am telling you
that they don't have the coins.

1972
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,290
- Let's go with So Min and Yeo Jin.
- Really?

1973
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,390
- I don't think that's right.
- It isn't So Min.

1974
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:09,970
Pick Ok Ja and Yeo Jin.
One of them has the coins.

1975
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,200
- Pick two.
- Again?

1976
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,430
(They pick the names again.)

1977
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,100
This isn't random at all.

1978
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:19,330
Team Girl will send the members
to the Judgment Stand first.

1979
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:20,870
- We have no idea.
- Seriously.

1980
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:22,100
We don't even know
how many people have the coins.

1981
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:23,870
We pick...

1982
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,870
- Jae Suk and Se Chan.
- Se Chan.

1983
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:28,120
(Jae Suk and Se Chan)

1984
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,310
- Okay. Go up there.
- Okay.

1985
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,450
- We don't know.
- We don't know.

1986
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:31,580
- We really don't know.
- We don't know.

1987
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,760
Why did you pick the two of them?

1988
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:35,680
I think the older members
are dissatisfied...

1989
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,220
with their protruding mouths.

1990
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:40,430
Come to think of it,
both of them have protruding mouths.

1991
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:41,870
They don't like protruding mouths.

1992
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:43,060
We really have no idea.

1993
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,490
They picked the two...

1994
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:45,790
- with protruding mouths.
- Right?

1995
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:48,870
Jae Suk and Se Chan,
open your notebooks...

1996
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:51,770
- on the count of three.
- Okay.

1997
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:53,200
- We don't know.
- I am curious.

1998
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,810
One,

1999
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:56,540
two,

2000
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:58,520
three.

2001
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,740
One, two, three.

2002
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:03,890
- Do you have coins?
- Se Chan has them.

2003
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:06,060
- What?
- Hold on.

2004
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,520
Se Chan has them.

2005
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,720
- Jae Suk has them too!
- They have coins.

2006
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,020
- What?
- How did this happen?

2007
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:14,270
Why did you give me coins?

2008
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,470
(Jae Suk has 5 coins.)

2009
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:17,740
I have four coins.

2010
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,010
(Se Chan has 4 coins.)

2011
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,370
- Why did you give me coins?
- How...

2012
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,080
I gave most of the coins
to the two of them.

2013
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,640
I gave one to myself.

2014
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:28,010
How many is it?

2015
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,270
(They got 9 out of 10 coins.)

2016
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:33,120
Jae Suk had 5 coins
and Se Chan had 4 coins.

2017
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,520
Team Girl acquired nine coins.

2018
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,020
(Team Girl gets ahead
by studying the faces.)

2019
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,290
I picked you guys at random.

2020
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:40,760
How did they do that?

2021
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:42,620
- It's our turn.
- Let's pick well.

2022
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,290
Ja Yeon, go up.

2023
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,600
- Ja Yeon has to go up.
- Ja Yeon.

2024
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,700
- Seo Yeon, go up.
- Go up.

2025
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,790
- She doesn't want to do it.
- Ja Yeon and Seo Yeon.

2026
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:49,060
I think they are feigning...

2027
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:50,930
- anxiety.
- Yeo Jin.

2028
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,600
Let's do Yeo Jin.

2029
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,910
Yeo Jin is looking at us.

2030
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,740
- I think it's Yeo Jin.
- She doesn't have coins.

2031
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,180
- I think it's Yeo Jin.
- I am poor.

2032
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,470
- It might be So Min.
- Those two have coins.

2033
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,770
They went up the stand too quickly.

2034
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:02,540
- But...
- Did you make up your mind?

2035
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:03,680
Not yet.

2036
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,810
We will pick So Min
instead of Seo Yeon.

2037
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,240
So Min?

2038
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,910
So Min, go up the stand...

2039
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,410
- while taking Yeo Jin's hand.
- Go up there.

2040
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,560
- What?
- Yeo Jin, go up the stand.

2041
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,990
- Me?
- Yeo Jin, go up the stand.

2042
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,060
My goodness. You have no intuition.

2043
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,990
- See? She is suspicious.
- What?

2044
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,470
- All right. Let's go with them.
- It's them.

2045
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:21,490
Yeo Jin has coins.

2046
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:23,490
So Min and Yeo Jin have coins.
Yeo Jin behaved strangely.

2047
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:24,990
- "You have no intuition."
- Yes. She is suspicious.

2048
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:26,930
- Yeo Jin and So Min. Let's go.
- It was a useless comment.

2049
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,810
- It wasn't a useless comment.
- Yes, it was.

2050
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:29,870
I think she was just being
easygoing.

2051
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,270
- Let's just go with them.
- Let's go.

2052
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:33,010
- Let's go with them.
- Let's go with them.

2053
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:34,080
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's see.

2054
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,600
- No regrets. We picked together.
- Yes.

2055
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,640
- One,
- Yeo Jin has coins.

2056
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,240
- two, three.
- Yeo Jin has coins.

2057
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,410
(Yeo Jin and So Min's notebooks
get revealed.)

2058
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:42,410
Three.

2059
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,760
One, two, three.

2060
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,450
- So Min has a lot.
- I have coins.

2061
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:49,780
- So Min has a lot.
- She has coins.

2062
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,210
I do.

2063
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,570
(So Min has 6 coins!)

2064
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:01,740
We got all of them!

2065
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:04,450
- We got all of them!
- Take them!

2066
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:07,110
We got all of them! No way!

2067
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:09,150
- I told you so. She was suspicious.
- Yeo Jin.

2068
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:10,230
We got them.

2069
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,690
- It was a useless comment.
- We did it.

2070
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,650
You have no intuition.

2071
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,530
You have no intuition.

2072
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:17,930
You found all ten coins.

2073
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:19,740
- You had no luck.
- You found all ten coins.

2074
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,140
- Okay.
- All right.

2075
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,330
- All right.
- We caught them both.

2076
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,700
We caught them both.

2077
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:27,200
- We caught them both.
- We got them.

2078
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,950
- We won.
- Unbelievable. They found nine.

2079
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,780
How did we pick the two of them?

2080
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,110
- No way.
- Interrogation is meaningless.

2081
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:35,110
- It was insane.
- No way.

2082
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,540
Let's pick at random
the next time too.

2083
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,490
- That's right.
- We never picked at random.

2084
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:41,210
- Picking at random is the way.
- We picked at random just now.

2085
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,690
- That was how we got them.
- That's right.

2086
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,080
- Seriously.
- They are so annoying.

2087
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,950
The last mission of the way...

2088
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:49,460
involves going on an intense journey
to find an answer.

2089
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,490
It's Go the Distance to Answer.

2090
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,740
For a balance
of strength and stamina,

2091
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:57,700
three Team Girl members
and two Team Boy members will play.

2092
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,810
Okay.

2093
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:02,200
All players will start
at the bottom.

2094
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,700
(All players will start
at the bottom.)

2095
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,350
They will go up the soapy slope,

2096
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:09,350
arrive at the quiz zone on the left,

2097
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:11,710
and sit down on the answer.

2098
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,580
- Jae Suk and Jong Kook.
- That's right.

2099
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,930
The quiz involves identifying
the people in the photo.

2100
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:18,990
You will see a morphed image
of three people.

2101
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:22,820
Sit down on the number
of a person who is in the photo.

2102
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:26,100
- Three people.
- A morphed image of three people.

2103
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,200
(Sit down on the number
of a person who is in the photo.)

2104
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,270
- Se Chan and Jong Kook should go.
- I have good eyes.

2105
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:33,310
There are 3 correct answers
and 2 incorrect answers,

2106
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:36,980
so picking a number first
will give you an advantage.

2107
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:40,680
The team will receive a point
for every correct answer.

2108
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,240
The team that acquires more points
will win.

2109
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,390
- Let's get ready.
- Okay.

2110
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,580
- So we sit down on the answer.
- That's right.

2111
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,390
- Okay.
- We need to go up there quickly.

2112
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,620
We can have a scuffle, right?

2113
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,750
- Yes.
- Okay.

2114
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:53,790
- Okay.
- Excuse me?

2115
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:54,790
- What?
- Don't be rude to a big sister.

2116
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:56,320
- I was just dancing.
- Right?

2117
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,240
This is nuts.

2118
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,140
Let's do this. Roar.

2119
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,400
Those who will enter Round One...

2120
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,960
should stand at the starting line.

2121
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,700
- Suk Jin and I will go.
- Okay.

2122
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,280
This is no joke.

2123
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,900
- My goodness.
- Yeo Jin, Ja Yeon, and...

2124
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,040
Those three?

2125
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,980
It's so slippery.
It will be impossible to go up.

2126
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,350
- We can't go up.
- It will be impossible to go up.

2127
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,350
We can't go up.

2128
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:21,280
- A run-up wouldn't help.
- It's really slippery.

2129
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,390
- Listen.
- We have done it before.

2130
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:24,150
- We need to work together.
- We need to work together.

2131
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,490
- Se Chan.
- We need to push each other.

2132
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:26,750
The middle one is the longest.

2133
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:28,490
Are we going against these three?

2134
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,600
- See? It's impossible.
- How will we go up?

2135
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,700
- My goodness.
- How will we go up?

2136
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,030
We have to get
the middle rope first.

2137
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,110
They are sprinkling
more soapy water.

2138
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:39,180
- Come here.
- I can't even get close to it.

2139
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,150
Ji Hyo and I will hold them back.

2140
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,610
Grab the middle rope at all costs...

2141
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:46,280
- and pull us up.
- Okay.

2142
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:47,780
- All of us need to go up.
- Go up...

2143
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:49,850
and give Ja Yeon a hand.

2144
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:50,950
Okay. Let's go.

2145
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:52,710
The round will begin
when I blow the whistle.

2146
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:54,190
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

2147
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:55,690
Who is it?

2148
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,280
You need to see it first.

2149
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,490
- Who are they?
- Who are they?

2150
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,490
- Don't you recognize the faces?
- I don't.

2151
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:02,490
(Cho Bo Ah, Han Ji Min,
Chun Woo Hee,)

2152
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:03,490
(Han Ye Seul, Park Min Young)

2153
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:07,790
(They need to guess 3 people
in the morphed image.)

2154
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,740
- Just go.
- Who are they?

2155
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,000
- Just go.
- Han Ji Min.

2156
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,500
Han Ji Min, Chun Woo Hee,
and Park Min Young.

2157
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,830
- Let's go up first.
- Is Min Young in there?

2158
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,110
(They begin to climb up the slope.)

2159
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,280
- Who else?
- This is impossible.

2160
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,650
- Let's go up first. Hey.
- Step on me.

2161
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:21,740
Hold on.

2162
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:24,580
- Hey.
- Good.

2163
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:27,020
(Jae Suk charges forward
while Team Girl members are busy.)

2164
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:29,730
(He gets pulled back down.)

2165
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:31,280
- All of us will fail.
- How are we supposed to go up?

2166
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,490
All of us will fail.

2167
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,030
(She marks Suk Jin.)

2168
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:35,930
is there no way to go up?

2169
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:39,660
(While everyone is looking
for a way to go up)

2170
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:42,310
- I don't think Bo Ah is there.
- Ye Seul.

2171
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:44,440
- No. Min Young isn't there.
- Woo Hee isn't there.

2172
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:46,140
- Woo Hee might be there.
- Ye Seul is.

2173
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,740
- I think Woo Hee is there.
- Ye Seul is definitely there.

2174
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:49,070
- Ye Seul.
- Ye Seul.

2175
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,280
- Ji Min.
- Look at Jae Suk.

2176
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,040
- Ye Seul is the most prominent.
- That's the best way, right?

2177
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,610
- That's the best way.
- That's the best way.

2178
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:54,980
That's the best way, right?

2179
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,320
- That's the best way.
- That's the best way.

2180
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,390
- That's the best way.
- What are you doing?

2181
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:00,320
You can't come up this way.

2182
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,390
You can't do that, Yeo Jin.

2183
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,280
Yeo Jin, you can't do that.

2184
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,860
- It's so slippery.
- Yeo Jin, you can't do that.

2185
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,030
(She attempts to play dirty.)

2186
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,120
Be careful.

2187
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:13,160
(Suk Jin climbs up the slope
by holding on to a bar.)

2188
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,330
That old man.

2189
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,310
What are you doing?

2190
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:17,900
You can't come up this way.

2191
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,330
- How did you go up that far?
- I am going up.

2192
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,810
(Suk Jin runs away...)

2193
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,000
(and Ja Yeon chases after him.)

2194
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,910
- Yeo Jin.
- I have no idea.

2195
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:26,950
(At that moment!)

2196
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,910
- Jae Suk grabbed a rope.
- Good.

2197
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:30,150
- Jae Suk.
- Ji Min.

2198
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,850
Ji Min and Ye Seul are there.

2199
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:33,190
- Okay.
- Ye Seul and Ji Min.

2200
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:34,710
- Ye Seul.
- Push off Ok Ja.

2201
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:35,820
Okay.

2202
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,120
- Let's go.
- Who?

2203
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,290
- No way.
- She is really strong.

2204
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,490
- No.
- Jae Suk.

2205
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:44,960
- Jae Suk, come back. Yeo Jin.
- You need to come back.

2206
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,440
- No.
- You need to ignore him.

2207
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,100
(The determined tiger moth
has arrived.)

2208
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,360
- Let's go.
- Push her down.

2209
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,660
Yeo Jin, grab him.

2210
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:54,140
Yeo Jin, grab him.

2211
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,370
Nice.

2212
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:00,870
(The tiger moth is out.)

2213
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,690
- Suk Jin!
- Gosh!

2214
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:07,320
No!

2215
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,990
(Slipping)

2216
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,030
I will get rid of Ok Ja.

2217
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,120
- Hold his hand.
- Ok Ja.

2218
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,990
Jae Suk, you might fall down
as well.

2219
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:17,320
Get rid of Ok Ja.

2220
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,900
- Climb up.
- Hold on.

2221
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,140
- Come here.
- Hold his hand.

2222
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:22,460
- Hold on.
- A rope.

2223
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:24,160
- Give me a rope.
- She is so strong.

2224
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,900
- A rope!
- She has so much stamina.

2225
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,030
(A rope!)

2226
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:29,310
- Suk Jin, you need to come up.
- A rope!

2227
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:30,810
(The old man is hanging on
by his toes.)

2228
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:31,870
A rope!

2229
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,040
It will be meaningless
if you don't come.

2230
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,890
Jae Suk, just sit down.

2231
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:37,410
(Slipping)

2232
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:38,540
For goodness' sake.

2233
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,110
(His toes couldn't hold on.)

2234
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:42,230
- Suk Jin is useless.
- Hold them.

2235
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,730
- Suk Jin, hurry up.
- There you go.

2236
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,030
(He begins the tearful climb again.)

2237
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:49,990
(Jae Suk is struggling
against two tiger moths.)

2238
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,160
Yeo Jin! They are no joke.

2239
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,600
(The two of them are formidable.)

2240
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,740
I warned you about Ok Ja.

2241
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:00,140
- Hey.
- She is no joke.

2242
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:01,830
- There is craziness in her eyes.
- She is no joke.

2243
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,480
- Ok Ja.
- There is craziness in her eyes.

2244
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,480
(The game changer with crazy eyes)

2245
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,410
Jae Suk, you need to grab a pole.

2246
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:09,910
(Jae Suk can't win against them.)

2247
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,710
- That's so funny.
- You need to grab a pole.

2248
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:13,560
Suk Jin, hurry up.

2249
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,950
(Panting)

2250
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:18,620
I am holding on.

2251
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:23,730
(The old hiker is having
a difficult fight by himself.)

2252
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,860
(He finally manages to arrive
at the railing.)

2253
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:30,240
(Breathing hard)

2254
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,240
- That's so funny.
- You need to grab a pole.

2255
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,030
- I am coming.
- Suk Jin, hurry up.

2256
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,370
(He arrived at the top
while no one was looking.)

2257
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:38,350
You need to push Ja Yeon
down the slope.

2258
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:40,980
She is taller than me.

2259
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,610
- My goodness.
- She grabbed a rope.

2260
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:45,240
- Ja Yeon and Yeo Jin...
- Let's go.

2261
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,490
- Come on.
- Are you grabbing a rope?

2262
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:48,820
(Getting ready solemnly
while holding a rope)

2263
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,620
(Breathing hard)

2264
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,100
(They are having
a 1-on-1 match too.)

2265
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,100
Hey. Go down. Okay.

2266
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:59,400
Give me a rope.

2267
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,030
- Ok Ja is cool.
- Ok Ja is cool.

2268
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:03,360
Hold on.

2269
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,500
What is Ji Hyo doing?

2270
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,180
Ji Hyo, what are you doing?

2271
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,870
(One member is still at the bottom.)

2272
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:13,370
(From now on)

2273
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:18,040
(You will lose a smile)

2274
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,110
(Look at this steep path)

2275
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,250
I think Ji Hyo is filming
a separate show.

2276
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,560
She can't go up the slope.

2277
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,230
It isn't easy.

2278
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,860
Look at this steep path

2279
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,160
- Okay. I got her.
- You are cool.

2280
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,290
(He jumps to the rope.)

2281
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,270
- That's my rope.
- What?

2282
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:39,440
No!

2283
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,530
Okay. I got her.

2284
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,480
- That's my rope.
- What?

2285
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,200
(He grabbed Suk Jin's lifeline.)

2286
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,180
- That's my rope.
- What?

2287
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:49,820
- No!
- No!

2288
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:51,890
(That's my rope.)

2289
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:54,990
- No!
- Oh, yes.

2290
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,890
- Ji Hyo.
- Why were you holding it?

2291
01:16:58,230 --> 01:16:59,750
- Ji Hyo.
- Grab the rope.

2292
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,060
Ji Hyo, hurry up and come here.

2293
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,930
Just sit down.

2294
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:05,270
- Where?
- Just sit down.

2295
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:06,660
- Just sit down.
- Everyone needs to go up anyway.

2296
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:07,900
- Don't worry about me.
- Everyone needs to sit down.

2297
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,160
Just sit down.

2298
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,610
It won't end until she gets here.

2299
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:12,640
- Let's sit down.
- It won't end until she gets here.

2300
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:13,940
Ji Min.

2301
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,180
Ji Min and Ye Seul.

2302
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,650
Two, four, and five.

2303
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:19,480
- I don't know the last one.
- Me neither.

2304
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,740
- Ji Hyo, come on.
- I think it's Woo Hee.

2305
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,520
- Where?
- Two and four.

2306
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:25,650
- Two and four.
- Suk Jin.

2307
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:28,020
- Hurry up. I don't know one.
- Two.

2308
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,890
(Ja Yeon changes her mind
from number 3 to number 5.)

2309
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:32,150
I don't know the last one.

2310
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:33,790
- Suk Jin, what's your number?
- I sat here.

2311
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:34,820
- Two?
- Three.

2312
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:36,570
- The answers are...
- That might be correct.

2313
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:37,930
- I sat here.
- Three.

2314
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:40,290
(What are the correct answers?)

2315
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:42,640
The answers are 2, 3, and 4.

2316
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,810
- We got them right.
- I knew Woo Hee was there.

2317
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,700
The answers are 2, 3, and 4.

2318
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:49,900
- We got lucky.
- We got lucky.

2319
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:55,070
(Yeo Jin, Suk Jin,
and Jae Suk were correct!)

2320
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:57,390
(They changed the seats
at the very end.)

2321
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:59,950
Team Girl got 1 point
and Team Boy got 2 points.

2322
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

2323
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,820
These two are no joke.

2324
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:04,560
- They are no joke.
- Seriously.

2325
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,030
- They are so strong.
- Haha and Se Chan.

2326
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:09,320
- I will go with Se Chan.
- Haha and Se Chan.

2327
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,400
Haha, mark Seo Yeon.

2328
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,990
(The two little men
were confident at first.)

2329
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,700
This is hard.

2330
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,460
(But tiger moths pulled them down.)

2331
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,940
Get Seo Yeon.

2332
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,240
(Meanwhile, the oldest member
reaches the top easily.)

2333
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,940
- Hey.
- Hey.

2334
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:23,450
- What are you doing?
- What are those punks doing?

2335
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:25,180
- Hold on.
- What are you doing?

2336
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,540
- What's up with her?
- She is too strong.

2337
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,450
- Hey.
- Sit down.

2338
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:30,990
The answers are 3, 4, and 5.

2339
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,320
(Team Girl gets
all the correct answers.)

2340
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,560
- Really?
- My goodness.

2341
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:39,120
- The last game ended.
- Okay.

2342
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,600
The combined points...

2343
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,660
- made Team Girl the winner.
- Why?

2344
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:45,960
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

2345
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,440
You will get ten coins each,

2346
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,270
- so distribute them as you want.
- Okay.

2347
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:52,330
You will pick the two members
one last time.

2348
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:54,280
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

2349
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,950
- Hey.
- Let's use the same strategy.

2350
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:57,180
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Thank you.

2351
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,850
We should leave it to one person.

2352
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:00,650
- That's right.
- One person?

2353
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,410
- One person?
- We should do that.

2354
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:03,820
Rock-paper-scissors.

2355
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:05,350
- No.
- It's correct.

2356
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:06,580
Rock-paper-scissors.

2357
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:07,910
- I won.
- Who won?

2358
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,280
- Suk Jin.
- Go with your instincts.

2359
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,450
I will distribute the coins.
Give them to me.

2360
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:12,820
I just need to write it down, right?

2361
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:15,360
- The loser should do it.
- Okay.

2362
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,360
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2363
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,400
Gosh.

2364
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,440
(Ja Yeon got chosen.)

2365
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,600
It happened in one go.

2366
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,960
(All the coins go to Ja Yeon!)

2367
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,000
Here.

2368
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,870
I will take care of them.

2369
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:27,280
- He will take care of them.
- I will take care of them.

2370
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,810
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2371
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:30,040
- Good luck.
- Excuse me.

2372
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:33,150
Two Team Boy members
will go up the stand first.

2373
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,210
- We have no idea.
- Please pick two.

2374
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:36,890
You can ask us questions.
We don't know anything.

2375
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:38,410
Why would you say that?

2376
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:41,020
- He wants a close-up shot.
- He wants a close-up shot.

2377
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,780
- He has a condition.
- Ask away.

2378
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,780
- Ask away.
- It's nice that we don't know.

2379
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,490
Right? We don't know.
I don't know anything either.

2380
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:49,620
Let's pick one member
using our hunches.

2381
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,770
- My hunch tells me it's Suk Jin.
- We need to pick two.

2382
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:54,100
- Could it be Haha?
- Suk Jin.

2383
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,600
- Suk Jin.
- We need to pick two.

2384
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,270
In that case,
the other one will be...

2385
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:00,200
Let's pick Jong Kook.

2386
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

2387
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,110
- Me?
- Yes.

2388
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:04,740
- Who else?
- Suk Jin.

2389
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,980
- Me?
- Okay.

2390
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:08,740
- You don't know, right?
- I really don't know.

2391
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,390
- Suk Jin and Jong Kook.
- Take your bag.

2392
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,150
- You need your bag.
- Don't tell me you know.

2393
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,750
- I don't know.
- I think he knows.

2394
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,080
- I think he knows.
- I think he has coins.

2395
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,080
- You look flustered.
- Suk Jin.

2396
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,780
You look flustered. Am I wrong?

2397
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,560
- It's not like that.
- Your face turned red.

2398
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,900
Maybe Suk Jin has all the coins.

2399
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,600
Seriously.

2400
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,490
- All right.
- Are they your choices?

2401
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:27,790
- Yes.
- Yes.

2402
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,030
- Suk Jin makes me anxious,
- Now,

2403
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:31,070
Jong Kook and Suk Jin,

2404
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:32,640
- hold up your notebooks.
- I am anxious.

2405
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,310
Open them on the count of three.

2406
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:37,200
To be honest, I mixed them up
without thinking.

2407
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,210
- Does Suk Jin have coins?
- One, two...

2408
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,740
- Let me give you another chance.
- No, thank you.

2409
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:42,890
You have coins, right?

2410
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:44,190
- One, two...
- You have coins, right?

2411
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:45,780
- Let me give you another chance.
- No, thank you.

2412
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,150
- One, two, three.
- Suk Jin knows.

2413
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:51,190
- One, two, three.
- Suk Jin knows.

2414
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,790
(What will be the result?)

2415
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,460
(They don't have any coins.)

2416
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,940
(0 coins)

2417
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,140
- Who has them?
- Who has them?

2418
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:04,700
- Jae Suk.
- Really?

2419
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,310
- Jae Suk.
- I don't have them either.

2420
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,610
This is how you make a bet.

2421
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:11,040
- Okay.
- It was a war of nerves.

2422
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,070
I mixed them up without thinking,

2423
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:14,150
- but I saw the name...
- Bang!

2424
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,210
- as I put in the coins.
- Really?

2425
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,520
All right.

2426
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,110
- Thank goodness.
- Now, Team Boy,

2427
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:21,080
please pick one Team Girl member.

2428
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,990
- I gave them to many members.
- Just one.

2429
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:25,190
We went all in.

2430
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,530
(Unlike Team Boy,)

2431
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:31,530
(Ja Yeon distributed the coins
to multiple members.)

2432
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,360
I really hope things go
as I planned.

2433
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:36,070
Please look this way.

2434
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:38,570
- Let's do this.
- Team Girl is leading...

2435
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:41,610
by two coins.

2436
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:43,180
- We...
- We just need to find the coins.

2437
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,200
You need to find two or more coins.

2438
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,980
- Cut us some slack...
- We just need to get one.

2439
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,710
- Just one.
- Let's have a draw.

2440
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:50,820
- Seriously.
- Let's not redo it.

2441
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:52,390
- For real.
- We are picking only one.

2442
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:53,490
- Only one.
- Who is it?

2443
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:54,710
- Are you stupid?
- Go with it.

2444
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:56,450
- Who is it?
- Go with it. Just go with it.

2445
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:57,730
- Go with Yeo Jin.
- Just go.

2446
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:58,730
Let's do that.

2447
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:00,700
- Just go with it. What we got...
- Choi Yeo Jin.

2448
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:02,430
(What they draw is Choi Yeo Jin.)

2449
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,430
- Choi Yeo Jin.
- All right. Let's go with it.

2450
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:04,990
(Yeo Jin gets on Judgment Stand.)

2451
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:06,270
- My goodness.
- We have no choice.

2452
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:07,640
- Just go.
- Look at Ja Yeon's face.

2453
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,990
- Let's just go with it.
- That's it.

2454
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:10,810
(Ja Yeon has a mysterious look
on her face.)

2455
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:12,310
Ja Yeon seems relaxed.

2456
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:14,310
- Me?
- Please go on the stand.

2457
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,740
- I think it's Ja Yeon.
- My gosh.

2458
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:18,950
Yeo Jin, show us your coins
as I count to three.

2459
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:20,850
Please. It has to be her.
Choi Yeo Jin!

2460
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:22,710
- It's not Yeo Jin.
- Yes. One person.

2461
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:23,890
- Can she go down?
- No.

2462
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:25,710
- The light is on.
- Let's just do this.

2463
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:27,080
Just go with her. We have no choice.

2464
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,320
- It must be Seo Yeon.
- We can't be sure.

2465
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,620
- Right.
- It's Seo Yeon.

2466
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:30,620
Now...

2467
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:33,750
- One, two, three.
- Look at her smile.

2468
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,700
- We have no choice.
- She should have two or more.

2469
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,070
(If Yeo Jin has 3 coins or more,
Team Boy can turn the table around.)

2470
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,270
- Three.
- Ta-da.

2471
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:50,750
(She has 1 coin.)

2472
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:51,790
One.

2473
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:54,480
(She has only 1 coin!)

2474
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,050
- One?
- One.

2475
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,260
- The difference is only one coin.
- Right.

2476
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,480
It's only one coin.

2477
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,590
(Team Boy failed to turn the table
around because of 1 coin.)

2478
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:00,830
Just one.

2479
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:03,390
- Ta-da.
- How many does Seo Yeon have?

2480
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:05,930
So the final score is 16 to 15.

2481
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:07,000
Team Girl wins.

2482
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,630
- What about Seo Yeon?
- Yes!

2483
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:10,370
She should have two or more.

2484
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:13,670
The three guests
who lead their team to victory...

2485
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:16,300
will get the prize.
Please bring in the prize.

2486
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,750
This is all about good luck.

2487
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:19,710
- My gosh.
- That's amazing.

2488
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,550
- What's that?
- My gosh.

2489
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,840
- Abalone?
- Abalone is in season now.

2490
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,590
- So we got you some abalones.
- It's abalone.

2491
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:29,180
(It's a gift for the tiger moths
who tried their best today.)

2492
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,590
- That's nice.
- Team Girl...

2493
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:33,590
gathered 16 coins today.

2494
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:37,050
You can change three coins
into one penalty sticker.

2495
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:39,220
So Team Girl gets...

2496
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,260
- five penalty stickers.
- That's a lot.

2497
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,470
Come here and change them.

2498
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:42,840
- What about us?
- We don't get any?

2499
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,560
- Because we lost?
- We can put them on anyone we want?

2500
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,470
They will give us
the penalty stickers?

2501
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:48,580
Yes. They can put the stickers
on the members they want.

2502
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:50,210
- We should be nice to them.
- I don't know.

2503
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:52,300
If I act silly now,
they will pick me.

2504
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,140
I have a lot of stickers.

2505
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:55,270
It will be fun
to give him more stickers.

2506
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:57,220
I got four stickers last week.

2507
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:59,090
- It was last week.
- To only one person?

2508
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:00,920
It will be fun to give
Haha more stickers.

2509
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:02,920
- Go ahead and do it.
- I have only one.

2510
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:04,290
Okay.

2511
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:06,330
- So this is...
- When does this end?

2512
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,690
- Next week.
- It will end next week.

2513
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:09,690
- We have only one week left.
- It won't be fun...

2514
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:11,020
- if you give them to one person.
- Whatever Penalty Project.

2515
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,020
- Jae Suk and...
- I don't think they will do that.

2516
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,390
Jae Suk and Se Chan have none.
That's just ridiculous.

2517
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,010
- Se Chan has nothing.
- Let's have the guests decide.

2518
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:21,600
Actually, considering
the average number,

2519
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,010
I think Se Chan needs some.

2520
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:24,470
(Let's give
all the stickers to Se Chan.)

2521
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:25,910
Let's give
all the stickers to Se Chan.

2522
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:28,220
But why?

2523
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,510
Because...

2524
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:30,840
- this is not fun.
- And you were...

2525
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,140
- Why not?
- being annoying today.

2526
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:33,290
- Jae Suk also has zero stickers.
- Jae Suk.

2527
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:35,180
- You were very annoying.
- Boombastic.

2528
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,260
Jae Suk has none.

2529
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,660
Se Chan was annoying,
so I'll give it to Se Chan.

2530
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,480
- Just wait.
- Let's give them all to Se Chan.

2531
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,960
No, don't say that.

2532
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,300
- What's with her?
- You got two.

2533
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:44,870
(Startled)

2534
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:45,970
- We just met.
- She's...

2535
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:47,760
What do you mean?
We did many TV shows together.

2536
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,500
But why would you...

2537
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,010
- Se Chan, you're...
- Why is she being like this?

2538
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:52,970
- Don't do that.
- He's so annoying.

2539
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:54,470
- This is surprising.
- Things have been so easy for you.

2540
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:55,470
Ja Yeon, you're next.

2541
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:57,380
I'll follow their opinion.

2542
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:59,140
- Good.
- What's wrong with her?

2543
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,420
(Yang Se Chan gets all the votes.)

2544
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:03,470
Do you know me? What's with you?

2545
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:05,840
- What's with her?
- Pick Jae Suk.

2546
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,290
- Right. So Min is...
- Jae Suk has nothing.

2547
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:08,790
Jae Suk has no stickers.

2548
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:10,310
(Nervous)

2549
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:11,960
If you pick me,
there will be a war next week.

2550
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,220
- Think carefully.
- Think of what you did to me today.

2551
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:16,800
- You were being so annoying.
- Seriously, why would you do that?

2552
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,300
(An expressway to the penalty)

2553
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,760
- Jae Suk has nothing.
- You can come from behind and win.

2554
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,870
Seriously?

2555
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:25,760
- Seo Yeon.
- We have one person left.

2556
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,930
- We've never met before.
- Just go with Se Chan.

2557
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:28,100
- What do I do?
- Pick Jae Suk.

2558
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,580
You should let him win.

2559
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:30,710
- Are you done?
- It's four to four.

2560
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:31,840
Give Jae Suk one.

2561
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,220
Seo Yeon is acquainted with Haha.

2562
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:35,250
Then... Gosh.

2563
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,580
- It's Seo Yeon's turn.
- Hey.

2564
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,720
You're not supposed
to pick your acquaintance.

2565
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:40,140
This has nothing to do with that.

2566
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,850
- Seo Yeon is close to Haha.
- They think this is a prize.

2567
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:44,880
- No.
- You two are close.

2568
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,020
- We need a balance here.
- My gosh.

2569
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,430
- What should I do to make it fun?
- Let him take the lead.

2570
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:50,760
- But...
- You get more stickers next week?

2571
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,390
- Yes.
- We will. We still have chances.

2572
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:54,260
- But there won't be a lot.
- There will be more.

2573
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,370
- Jae Suk needs one though.
- He needs a sticker.

2574
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:57,370
We can't be sure
there will be five stickers.

2575
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:59,630
- Seo Yeon, isn't this interesting?
- Jae Suk...

2576
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,430
Don't you want to make it
more interesting?

2577
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:03,410
- Five in a row.
- It will be interesting.

2578
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:04,600
- All the stickers...
- You know what?

2579
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,510
It's more interesting
when it's neck and neck.

2580
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:07,770
- Exactly.
- Right.

2581
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:09,080
- What?
- That's...

2582
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,510
- Ji Suk Jin?
- That's a good idea.

2583
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:12,590
He will be the next big thing.

2584
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:14,980
- That's a good idea.
- Good job.

2585
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:17,260
That's not a bad idea.
This is plausible.

2586
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:18,880
- Make it a three-cornered fight.
- I'll...

2587
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,590
I want Suk Jin
to be on TV for a long time.

2588
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:22,800
Right. He'd love that.

2589
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,890
That's right!

2590
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,370
- I think this is better.
- That's right!

2591
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:28,370
(She chooses Ji Suk Jin.)

2592
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:29,670
She's really good.

2593
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:31,560
- A good choice.
- Nice.

2594
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,560
What about Jae Suk?

2595
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,840
He got four stickers today.

2596
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,930
- What's this?
- Look at this.

2597
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:37,970
Yeo Jin.

2598
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:40,410
Today's race is over now.

2599
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:41,420
- Thank you, everyone.
- Thank you.

2600
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:43,340
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2601
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:46,640
We will give
more stickers next week.

2602
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,850
(Jae Suk, Suk Jin, Jong Kook,
Haha, Ji Hyo, Se Chan, So Min)

2603
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:51,290
(The finale of the penalty project
with the scenery of fall)

2604
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:54,390
(It's a gourmet trip to Gangwon
Province, the land of plenty.)

2605
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:56,520
- Hello.
- Let's dance.

2606
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,260
(There could've been a trip,)

2607
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:02,230
(but it's suddenly changed
to My Heart in Gangwon Province.)

2608
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,370
(The worst penalties are
finally revealed.)

2609
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:07,410
(Even the heavy rain
can't stop the battle.)

2610
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:09,380
(They have to bet their everything.)

2611
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:11,770
(Apologize to your parents.)

2612
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,470
(With the Olympic spirit
of Gangwon Province,)

2613
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:15,580
(they will have the final race
of the Whatever Penalty Project.)

2614
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:17,790
(They want to avoid the penalty
at all costs.)

2615
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:19,880
(And the race is overheating.)

2616
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,310
(Yoo Jae Suk
Specialty: Playing pranks)

2617
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:22,960
(Kim Jong Kook, Specialty: Bluffing
Jeon So Min, Specialty: Daydreaming)

2618
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,160
(Song Ji Hyo Specialty:
Abnormal behavior)

2619
