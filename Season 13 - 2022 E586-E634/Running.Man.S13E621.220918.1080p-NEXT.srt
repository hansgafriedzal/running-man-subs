1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,770
(To finish the 4-week-long
Whatever Penalty Project,)

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,820
(a special race in Gangwon Province
was prepared.)

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,920
(However...)

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,360
(The weather suddenly became worse.)

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,460
(I'm afraid we will have to postpone
the shoot in Gangwon Province.)

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,590
(Can we find another place?)

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,600
(Okay!)

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,530
(And we will need a new theme.)

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,420
(The production crew's
group chat room is busy.)

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,420
It's raining a lot.

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,190
Is it raining hard?
Gosh, it's raining heavily.

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Are we going somewhere?

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,810
- The theme is traveling.
- Where are we going?

14
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,810
This way.

15
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,900
- Can we just go in there?
- Please come in.

16
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
My gosh.

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,940
Let's go.

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,240
(A familiar voice welcomes them.)

20
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,950
Hello.

21
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,140
- What's going on?
- If you really want us

22
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,420
- This is Haha's song.
- Make some noise

23
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,460
Make some noise!

24
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,280
- This is Haha's new song.
- Haha.

25
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,420
So this is the song.

26
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,230
- This is it.
- I like the song.

27
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,890
Hello.

28
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,700
We are going underground again.

29
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,700
I see.

30
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,030
I just hit like on your video.

31
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,130
But I did it
without listening to the song.

32
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,130
- So...
- I didn't expect you to hear it.

33
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,710
So I didn't know it was your song.

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,340
- I was like, "What is this?"
- "Maniac."

35
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,350
Right.

36
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,500
What? Did you call him a maniac?

37
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,850
That's the title.

38
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,250
- No.
- She just called you a maniac.

39
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,440
- Why?
- That's the title.

40
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,080
- The title is "Maniac."
- Is that what you meant?

41
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,940
What's with you, So Min?
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

42
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,190
I heard today's theme was traveling.

43
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,660
That's why I'm dressed like this.

44
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,250
- You two should go together.
- You two will get a penalty.

45
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,960
- This is about traveling.
- What's going on?

46
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,720
You don't look like
you're going on a trip.

47
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,270
- That's not it.
- I'm just dressed casually.

48
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,060
We were going to have
the last penalty race...

49
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,440
in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province today.

50
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,660
- I know.
- That's right.

51
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,330
- This is too bad.
- Too bad.

52
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,610
But we had to cancel it
due to the typhoon.

53
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,830
- I see.
- The typhoon is scary.

54
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,140
I hope there will be
no damage caused by the typhoon.

55
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,800
I heard it would be powerful.

56
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,550
- I hope nothing will happen.
- Please. It should veer off us.

57
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,310
- It should.
- We were disappointed,

58
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,890
so we rented a restaurant that
serves dishes of Gangwon Province.

59
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,050
You know Suk Jin is...

60
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,160
- from Gangwon Province.
- I'm from Gangwon Province.

61
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,610
- Suk Jin is?
- Jeongseon.

62
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,190
- I'm from Jeongseon.
- He went to Jeongseon...

63
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,720
- on Running Man the other day.
- He's from Jeongseon.

64
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,690
But none of the local residents
recognized him.

65
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,160
"Everyone! I'm Ji Suk Jin,
the son of Jeongseon!"

66
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,300
- "What?"
- They had no idea.

67
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,890
He's the son...

68
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,610
(About 9 years ago,
he had the shoot in Jeongseon.)

69
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,530
(Did you know
Suk Jin was from Jeongseon?)

70
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,710
(We didn't know.)

71
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,520
I'm still the son of Jeongseon.

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,550
Suk Jin, what kind of dish
is famous in Jeongseon?

73
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,320
Jeongseon is famous...

74
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,960
- Rice with thistle?
- Right. Rice with thistle.

75
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,360
- Look... Is that right?
- Thistle?

76
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,920
- It tastes good.
- Is it famous in Jeongseon?

77
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,990
Rice with thistle is good.

78
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,330
Suk Jin likes beef tripe.

79
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,830
Who likes beef tripe?

80
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,120
Suk Jin, you like lamb.

81
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,620
- I do like lamb.
- He likes lamb.

82
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,540
- I like lamb.
- He likes lamb.

83
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,930
- Suk Jin likes lamb.
- Lamb.

84
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,540
But he couldn't eat lamb
when he went to Mongolia.

85
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,430
- It had a strong flavor.
- He only ate cup noodles.

86
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,610
- It was quite strong.
- You know what?

87
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,640
Suk Jin doesn't even know himself.

88
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
- He's just fake.
- I really like lamb.

89
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,740
- He lives a fake life.
- He's still learning about himself.

90
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,920
He's getting to know about him.

91
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,050
That's so funny.

92
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,740
All right. Please have a seat first.

93
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,140
- Okay.
- And enjoy the food.

94
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,390
All right. Thank you.

95
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,420
My gosh. This is a sumptuous feast.

96
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,650
This is buckwheat crepe.

97
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,960
- What is this?
- This is ongsimi.

98
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,390
- It looks delicious.
- Look at this bossam.

99
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,700
And this is makguksu.

100
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,300
- Let's eat.
- Enjoy.

101
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,460
This is so good.

102
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,960
(Yoom)

103
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,300
- It's delicious.
- It is.

104
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,830
- I love it.
- It's so tasty.

105
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,610
The bossam is really good.

106
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,240
It melts in my mouth.

107
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,400
- This makguksu...
- Try the ongsimi.

108
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,080
- Potato ongsimi.
- By the way...

109
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,240
- Let me tell you something funny.
- What?

110
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,890
I asked our writer to give me...

111
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,360
- our mission bag.
- Our bag?

112
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
Yes. I asked, "Can I get my bag?"

113
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,580
And she said, "Okay.
You'll get it once you go in there."

114
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,420
- Where?
- So...

115
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,730
I thought we'd get something here.

116
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,730
- Can I get my bag?
- You'll get it once you go in.

117
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,330
- Please come in.
- Se Chan.

118
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,860
- She just pushed you in.
- She just said that.

119
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,170
- Just to send you in.
- She meant, "Just go in."

120
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,830
She didn't want to say much.
"All right. Just go in."

121
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,370
That means, "Stop talking
nonsense and just go in."

122
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
- She's unbelievable.
- That's adorable.

123
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,420
You fell for that.

124
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,050
- She's unbelievable.
- She works hard.

125
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,020
On Saturday...

126
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,550
Jong Kook suddenly called me
the previous day.

127
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,550
(Jong Kook suddenly called me
the previous day.)

128
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,760
"Jae Suk!
What are you doing tomorrow?"

129
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,730
"Can you come over
for my YouTube channel?"

130
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,390
"We can just talk
for about an hour."

131
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,700
(Jae Suk and Suk Jin joined
Jong Kook's channel as guests.)

132
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,730
We filmed
for about an hour and a half,

133
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,070
- You cast them?
- but we got three episodes.

134
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,430
- Really?
- Did you do the shoot?

135
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,490
I did.

136
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,530
If you have three episodes,
you should give me one.

137
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,440
- Suk Jin, stay out of this.
- That could be a way.

138
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,330
Suk Jin, you didn't do much though.

139
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,950
I promised Jong Kook
that I'd join his channel.

140
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,140
- That's right.
- You can't do this.

141
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,140
You called me
and asked me to join you.

142
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,390
That's because you weren't doing
anything at home when I called you.

143
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,190
So I asked, "Do you want to go to
Jong Kook's place and do nothing?"

144
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,060
Suk Jin was invited
as a special MC.

145
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,330
- That's right.
- Yes.

146
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,130
(He was invited as a special MC
at the last moment.)

147
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,890
Ji Hyo, what did you do yesterday?

148
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,220
I was at home yesterday.

149
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Doing nothing?

150
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
I slept.

151
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,070
Ji Hyo, why do you always
stick at home doing nothing?

152
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,070
(Ji Hyo, why do you always
stick at home doing nothing?)

153
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,370
What are you talking about?

154
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,010
Don't be like that, Ji Hyo.

155
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,180
- She's not like you though.
- Why would you say that?

156
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,380
Be confident and go out more.

157
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,970
The world is your oyster.

158
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,310
Do you think life is short?

159
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,640
- It's not like I can't go out.
- What? Life...

160
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,180
(Do you think life is short?)

161
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,450
- It's not like I can't go out.
- What? Life...

162
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,910
- "Do you think life is short?"
- What is he saying?

163
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,850
- Life is...
- I'm startled. What does that mean?

164
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,580
"Do you think life is short?"

165
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,080
(He can't even tell
what's right and what's wrong.)

166
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,850
Do you think life is long?

167
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,560
- What is he saying?
- What's that supposed to mean?

168
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,200
- By the way...
- You should go out.

169
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,720
Why were you at home doing nothing
when you knew all that?

170
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
You always stay home.

171
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,030
I'm old enough to stay home.

172
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,270
Something good will
happen to Suk Jin soon.

173
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,660
- Suk Jin.
- Hey.

174
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,380
- Suk Jin.
- Stop talking.

175
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,640
- Is that true?
- Suk Jin has good news.

176
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,270
- Will you stop it?
- I mean,

177
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,450
his wife is...

178
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,770
going on a trip to the States.

179
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,540
(His wife is going on a trip
to the States.)

180
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,410
Play the music!

181
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,620
(Waving his hand to deny it)

182
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,210
He's really excited now.

183
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,960
- I told him.
- That's not true.

184
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,350
(It means a lot
to the devoted husband, Mr. Ji.)

185
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,220
That's not true. No.

186
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,700
- He's really excited.
- No, I'm not.

187
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,460
- What are you going to do?
- What?

188
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,460
What's your plan?

189
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,230
I'll just stay home.
I have nothing to do.

190
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,210
- Then you should come to my place.
- Why?

191
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,270
To babysit Na Eun.

192
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,770
(Come and babysit Na Eun.)

193
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,030
- I have no place to go.
- Once you arrive, she will come...

194
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,310
running to you saying, "Grandpa!"

195
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,750
She will come running to you...

196
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,950
saying, "Grandpa!"

197
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,520
"Grandpa!"

198
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,640
As soon as you arrive...

199
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,760
- Why grandpa?
- Na Eun likes grandpas.

200
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,480
She's so adorable.

201
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,580
Because grandpas
often give her pocket money.

202
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,060
- Hey.
- That's why she likes them.

203
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,930
- "Grandpa!"
- My gosh.

204
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,700
- You should wear hanbok then.
- Grandpa.

205
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,930
Congratulations, Suk Jin.

206
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,090
- Congratulations.
- What do you mean?

207
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,290
I'm really worried.

208
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,460
How would I hold out for a month...

209
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,330
(How would I
hold out for a month...)

210
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,640
Why are you laughing?

211
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,100
Suk Jin.

212
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,730
(Laughing hard)

213
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,450
- He's so happy.
- Why are you laughing?

214
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,880
No. I'm really worried.

215
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,970
Why do you guys just assume...

216
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,450
that a husband will be happy...

217
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,520
when a wife goes on a trip?

218
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,890
(Laughing)

219
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,760
(He can't hold back his laughter.)

220
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,930
Why are you laughing?

221
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,630
(He can't hold it in.)

222
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,460
Why are you so happy?

223
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,830
Suk Jin.

224
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,330
Don't be like that.

225
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,530
I've never seen him so happy before.

226
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,830
(I've never seen him
so happy before.)

227
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,680
That's just an outdated thought.

228
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,140
- That's outdated.
- I know.

229
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,340
This is hilarious.

230
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,010
We have a penalty for Suk Jin.

231
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,270
(We have a penalty for Suk Jin.)

232
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,040
Send him to the States
to meet his wife.

233
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,890
(A special penalty for Suk Jin)

234
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,210
- No, that's not true.
- Sounds good.

235
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,480
Suk Jin,
it will be a nice surprise.

236
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,150
- No.
- It can be a surprise for her.

237
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,460
She will be so happy.

238
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,330
It's not like I can go
to the States only for 3 or 4 days.

239
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,200
Then you should talk to Hyung In...

240
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,460
You'll just go see her face
and come back.

241
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,500
- Just see her face.
- If you want to go,

242
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
- I can give you two weeks.
- What?

243
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,590
I'll let you take two weeks off.

244
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,660
You can take two weeks off.

245
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,570
- Hey, don't do that.
- Bring a camera with you.

246
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,080
He gets 2 weeks off out of 4 weeks.

247
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,310
- That's very generous.
- Hyung In.

248
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,010
She wants him to be gone
for two weeks.

249
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,340
I have to come every week.

250
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,340
So we will do the shoot without him?

251
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,180
(They all are serious
when teasing Suk Jin.)

252
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,250
That's not true.
My wife would get the wrong idea.

253
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,210
- She might take it the wrong way.
- Right. She might misunderstand it.

254
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,960
Su Jung, you might fall for that.

255
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,480
This is hilarious.

256
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,130
The typhoon... Seriously...

257
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,930
So what are we going
to do with the penalty?

258
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,570
It will be decided today, right?

259
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,830
Yes, today.

260
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,460
We're in trouble.
It will be decided today.

261
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,140
- Will two people get the penalty?
- Yes.

262
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,230
Today, in this episode,

263
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,940
we will decide on
the one with the most stickers,

264
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,100
and the one with the fewest stickers
will be exempted from the penalty.

265
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,810
- Exempted?
- Exempted right away?

266
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
Exempted from the penalty?

267
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,470
Hang on. What's the current score?

268
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,380
- We have 4 and 4...
- I'm losing my appetite now.

269
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,910
It's not easy to win
first place on Running Man.

270
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,910
Suk Jin has three.

271
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,520
- Do I have three stickers?
- Jong Kook has...

272
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,820
- One.
- I have one.

273
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,390
- Only 1 sticker?
- And Haha has 4.

274
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,430
We will get more anyway.

275
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,430
It's 0, 1, 3, and 4 stickers.

276
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Se Chan and I have four stickers?

277
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,330
Guys, you know what?

278
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,170
Jae Suk has none,
so we should give him more stickers.

279
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't have to
tell you this, right?

280
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,440
- Yes.
- Sure.

281
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,330
- The one to get more stickers.
- Right.

282
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,410
- He has zero stickers.
- That doesn't sound right.

283
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,650
Jae Suk has none.

284
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,950
That doesn't make sense.

285
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,150
We have to give him
all the stickers.

286
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,950
We should give him all. Everyone.

287
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,320
- Can you believe Jae Suk has none?
- No.

288
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,740
- That's unbelievable.
- Let's give him all the stickers.

289
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,850
- I'm nervous today.
- That just doesn't sound right.

290
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,960
Jae Suk and Jong Kook
look intimate today.

291
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,980
But I...

292
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,220
This is why I'm feeling reassured.

293
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,750
This isn't what I intended,

294
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,760
but I did Jong Kook
a favor last week.

295
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Gladly.

296
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,440
(I did Jong Kook
a favor last week. Gladly.)

297
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,630
- Jong Kook!
- My gosh.

298
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,630
Is this what you intended?

299
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,170
(He joined Jong Kook's channel
at a time like this.)

300
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,310
So they formed an alliance.

301
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,680
I went there...

302
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,970
and did a lot of interesting things.

303
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,820
- It was really fun.
- I know.

304
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,450
I hate it
when these two work together.

305
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,820
- Did you enjoy your food?
- Yes.

306
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,610
We had to cancel the race
we prepared due to the typhoon.

307
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,160
Instead, we prepared
We Want to Go to Gangwon Race today.

308
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,120
- I really want to go to Gangwon.
- I want to go.

309
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,170
Can't you say it better?
That's just lame.

310
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,040
- "We Want to Go to Gangwon."
- "We Want to Go to Gangwon."

311
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,730
We Want to Go to Gangwon.

312
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,810
We will have
We Want to Go to Gangwon Race.

313
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,440
- Well done.
- We can't go to Gangwon,

314
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,180
but we will have missions
that will remind you of the place.

315
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,580
When you think of Gangwon,

316
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,510
the first thing that comes
to your mind is potato.

317
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,880
Today, you will get potatoes
instead of R-coins.

318
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,110
- They are real potatoes.
- They are delicious.

319
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,080
After each mission, the winning team
will get 13 potatoes...

320
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,190
and the losing team
will get ten potatoes.

321
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,430
With the potatoes you earn
from each mission,

322
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,200
you will have the final mission.

323
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,590
And you will get penalty stickers
depending on the results.

324
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,260
So please try to get
as many potatoes as possible.

325
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,130
There will be two teams
for today's race.

326
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,330
Haha and Se Chan with
the most stickers will be captains.

327
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,680
(Team Yang Se Chan and Team Haha)

328
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,740
Haha, Jong Kook, Ji Hyo,
and So Min will be a team.

329
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,840
(Team Haha: Jong Kook,
Ji Hyo, and So Min)

330
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,370
And Se Chan, Jae Suk,
and Suk Jin will be a team.

331
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,710
Really?

332
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,510
- Why is that?
- Each team has...

333
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,190
- seven penalty stickers in total.
- I see. Okay.

334
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,610
Let's begin the first mission then.

335
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,790
- Okay.
- Show us.

336
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,620
- Okay.
- This is about a penalty.

337
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,490
Please take a seat with your team.

338
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,430
I think I'm on a stronger team.

339
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,120
- That's not true.
- Don't you think so?

340
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,300
- It's a weak team because of you.
- Right.

341
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,940
You make your team weak.

342
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,100
The team that has you
has to be weak.

343
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,360
(Her rival provokes her.)

344
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,500
What's with him?

345
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,940
You know what, So Min?

346
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,580
The team that has you is weak.

347
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,970
And the team that has Suk Jin
is the weakest.

348
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,010
I think Suk Jin is
taking his own course.

349
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,820
Suk Jin,
if you provoke So Min like that...

350
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,290
- She will give you stickers.
- She will choose you.

351
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,920
Don't do anything silly today.

352
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,420
Here's the first mission...

353
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,030
where you can experience
a trip to Gangwon indirectly.

354
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,290
It's called How Have You Been.

355
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,120
(Mission 1: How Have You Been)

356
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,360
- How have you been?
- What was that?

357
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,440
- How have you been? She's good.
- You sound better now.

358
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,170
You'll hear a sentence
spoken in Gangwon dialect...

359
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,910
- and guess what it means.
- I can do that.

360
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,040
- He's from Jeongseon.
- I'm from Jeongseon.

361
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,370
But he doesn't know anything.

362
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,240
I moved when I was three,
so I don't know much.

363
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,340
You should say "Let me answer"
before giving your answer.

364
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,840
And the team who gives
more correct answers wins the game.

365
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Okay.

366
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,010
- Here's the first question.
- Okay.

367
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,380
Please play the question.

368
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,690
- I should catch the nuance.
- It's really difficult.

369
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,690
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

370
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,120
Don't you think
you're being too yangyang?

371
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,900
(Don't you think
you're being too yangyang?)

372
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,300
- Yangyang?
- Let me answer.

373
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,830
Jae Suk, don't you think
you're being too frivolous?

374
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,600
- Hey.
- I think that's correct.

375
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,230
- Aren't you being too frivolous?
- That sounds about right.

376
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,440
Being yangyang.

377
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,210
Let me answer. Jae Suk,

378
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,050
aren't you being too nagging?

379
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,050
Let me answer.

380
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,610
Jae Suk.

381
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,710
- Aren't you being too nosy?
- That must be it.

382
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,950
- I think that's it.
- No?

383
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,380
Jae Suk, aren't you
being too mischievous?

384
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,380
That's the same thing.

385
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,960
Frivolous and mischievous.

386
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,850
Jae Suk.

387
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,490
Is it about his mouth? Isn't
your mouth protruding too much?

388
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,330
- No, that's not it.
- Jae Suk.

389
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,360
Ji Hyo, you do it.

390
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,040
- I'll give you the second sentence.
- Okay.

391
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,590
- Please.
- You'll hear it together.

392
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,310
- At the same time.
- Okay.

393
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,910
Jae Suk thinks he's popular.

394
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,210
(Jae Suk thinks he's popular.
I hate it when he's being yangyang.)

395
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,650
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

396
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,100
- Let me answer.
- He said that first.

397
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,010
- Let me answer.
- That means he's bragging.

398
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,580
Okay.

399
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,190
- He puts on airs.
- Jong Kook.

400
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,320
- He brags.
- I thought the same thing.

401
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,580
I knew it. I was going to say boast.

402
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,460
- That means he puts on airs.
- This is difficult.

403
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,490
- I'll give you the next question.
- Okay.

404
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,590
Haha.

405
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,960
Haha.

406
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,800
Where's your jabakseoi?

407
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,210
(Haha. Where's your jabakseoi?)

408
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,230
Where's your jabakseoi?

409
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,970
Let me answer. Where are your wits?

410
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,940
Jabakseoi?

411
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,870
- Jabakseoi?
- Jabakseoi?

412
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,210
- What's jabakseoi?
- I'd like to hear it again.

413
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,840
- Okay.
- Haha...

414
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,050
Haha.

415
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,240
(Haha. Where's your jabakseoi?)

416
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,190
Where's your jabakseoi?

417
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,820
- "Where is it?"
- Jabakseoi.

418
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,880
Jabakseoi.

419
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,690
- I guess it's manners.
- Manners.

420
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,720
Your brain?

421
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,030
- "Where are your manners?"
- Give it a try.

422
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,060
It must be your brain.

423
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,090
- "Where are your manners?"
- Give it a try.

424
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,570
- Brain?
- Manners.

425
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,990
- Brain?
- Brain.

426
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,230
Your brain.

427
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,570
- Isn't it like a calf?
- No.

428
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,260
- Is it height?
- "Where's your height?"

429
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,940
- That can't be it.
- Where's your brain?

430
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,870
Where's your brain?

431
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,210
- Where's your brain?
- Where's your brain?

432
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,450
Your head... Your brain.

433
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,650
It's the brain.

434
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,950
Where's your jabakseoi?

435
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,050
Go ahead and try it.

436
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,080
Can I try?

437
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,320
- It can't be brain.
- No.

438
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,210
Why would they say such a thing
even in Gangwon dialect?

439
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,320
Your brain...

440
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,460
Let me answer.

441
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,560
Where are your manners?

442
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,300
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

443
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,750
- Let me answer.
- I think that's correct.

444
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,930
Where is your hair?

445
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,300
- No.
- That must be it.

446
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,400
That's correct!

447
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,040
- I was going to say that.
- My gosh.

448
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,260
- Gosh, So Min.
- I was going to say that.

449
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,540
(So Min heard Se Chan carefully
when he talked about the brain.)

450
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,740
Hair.

451
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,680
- See? I told you.
- I was going to say that.

452
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,920
I was going to say it.

453
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,950
- I said hair.
- Is it hair?

454
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,340
That's what I thought.

455
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,960
- We gave them a hint.
- Is that jabakseoi?

456
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,980
- This is jabakseoi.
- That means hair.

457
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,010
Jabak.

458
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,060
- Jabak?
- All right.

459
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,220
- I'll give you the next question.
- Okay.

460
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,960
So Min got it right.

461
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,460
Give us the question.

462
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,760
- Hurry and give us.
- That's the North Korean dialect.

463
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,220
- That's North Korean.
- Since Se Chan is...

464
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,570
siksbari...

465
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,990
(Since Se Chan is siksbari...)

466
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,570
Since Se Chan is siksbari,
I thought he was jinsengi.

467
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,680
- What was that? Who?
- "Sisbari" is "jinsengi?"

468
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,600
- "Sisbari?"
- What is "sisbari?"

469
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,780
- Was she talking about me?
- "Sisbari..."

470
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,100
Can we hear it one more time?

471
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,790
Since Se Chan is siksbari,
I thought he was jinsengi.

472
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,550
- Is this the Korean language?
- Let me answer.

473
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,750
Since Se Chan rarely showers,
I thought he was dirty.

474
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,120
(That could also be
a correct answer.)

475
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,160
Isn't that a correct answer?
I think it is.

476
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,960
- It should be the correct answer.
- "Since Se Chan rarely showers..."

477
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,200
I'm dirty.

478
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,570
Since Se Chan rarely showers,

479
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,120
- I thought he was dirty.
- "I thought he was dirty."

480
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,540
- I rarely shower.
- Is it incorrect?

481
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,170
- What does "siksbari" mean?
- "I thought he was jinsengi."

482
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,410
Let me answer.

483
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,500
Se Chan...

484
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,470
has a face of a beast.

485
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,610
- "Jingsengi" sounds similar to it.
- That's right.

486
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,650
- "I thought he was jinsengi."
- Let us hear it just one more time.

487
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,740
Since Se Chan is siksbari,

488
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,610
people used to think
that he was jinsengi.

489
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,720
- "Since Se Chan is siksbari..."
- "Siksbari..."

490
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,490
- Does it mean "clumsy?"
- "To make mistakes often?"

491
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,830
- Oh, right.
- Yes.

492
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,330
- You go ahead. Let him answer.
- Let me answer.

493
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,570
Since Se Chan made mistakes often,
I thought he was a beast.

494
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,570
- Let me answer.
- I'll tell you...

495
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,960
what "jinsengi" means.

496
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,830
- Please tell us.
- "Jinsengi" means...

497
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,540
- "stupid."
- Oh, I see. It means "stupid."

498
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,680
Since Se Chan is siksbari,
people used to think...

499
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,810
- that he was stupid.
- "Siksbari?"

500
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,970
- Hey, were you...
- "Siksbari?"

501
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,280
- Were you born at six months?
- "Siksbari?"

502
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,980
- Were you born at six months?
- "Siksbari?"

503
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,790
- Let me answer. Since Se Chan...
- Could it mean "empty head?"

504
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,690
was born at six months, he's stupid.

505
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,750
- "Empty head?"
- Gosh.

506
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,790
- Let me answer.
- Isn't that what "siksbari" means?

507
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,330
Since Se Chan always makes mistakes,

508
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,250
- I think that's correct.
- Since he always makes mistakes,

509
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,070
- No, I don't think so.
- he's stupid.

510
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,330
"Siksbari" is an action
that Se Chan does often.

511
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,670
What do you do often?

512
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,760
Something that I do often?

513
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
- And it makes him look stupid?
- She said she thought I was stupid.

514
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,680
- She thought he was stupid.
- Because he does it too often...

515
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,500
- Let me answer.
- Se Chan! I think it means "klutz."

516
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
- Let me answer.
- Se Chan!

517
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,370
- I think it means "klutz."
- She must know the answer.

518
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,010
- Since Se Chan...
- He was fast. We have a chance.

519
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,450
- It's our turn. They had a chance.
- We have a chance.

520
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,660
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

521
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,380
Since Se Chan is a klutz,

522
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,030
- No, that's not it.
- I thought he was stupid.

523
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,750
Since Se Chan is a klutz,

524
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,590
- No, that's not it.
- I thought he was stupid.

525
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,090
Let me answer.
Since Se Chan laughs all the time,

526
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,220
I thought he was stupid.

527
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,460
- Oh, right.
- That must be correct.

528
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,960
(So Min got two questions right
in a row.)

529
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,460
Yes, that's correct.

530
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,700
- You did a great job.
- Okay.

531
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,760
- I had no idea.
- Oh, my.

532
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,110
- I had no idea.
- A person who laughs easily?

533
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,030
- Like "silso" as in "laugh?"
- Since he laughs easily...

534
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,240
I must say, she speaks
Gangwon dialect perfectly.

535
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,410
- Did you understand what she said?
- Yes. I mean...

536
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,680
- "Siksbari."
- Here's your next question.

537
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,040
You have to block gunggei obudengi.

538
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,390
- What?
- You have to block gunggei...

539
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,540
obudengi.

540
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,690
Block what? Fart?

541
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,160
- No.
- To block something "obudengi?"

542
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,660
- "Obudengi?"
- Let me answer.

543
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,220
- To block something "obudengi?"
- "Obudengi?"

544
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,550
- Let me answer.
- No.

545
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,870
(Level One:
You have to block gunggei obudengi.)

546
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,020
You have to block the anus
with a cork.

547
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,440
- Of course, it's incorrect.
- Right.

548
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,490
- I think it's correct.
- I agree.

549
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,840
It's something like that.
To stop farting.

550
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,170
No, that's not what it means.

551
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,840
- "Obudengi."
- "Obudengi."

552
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,030
- Let me answer.
- I know the first word.

553
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,850
- Block farts thoroughly.
- No, it doesn't mean "farts."

554
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,040
That's not correct.

555
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,920
What was the word? "Obudengi?"

556
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,010
- Let me answer. Block the butt...
- Block it with fish cakes.

557
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,950
Fish cakes? You thought
"obdengi" means "oden," didn't you?

558
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,010
Fish cakes? What kind of fish cakes?

559
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,660
- Fish cakes...
- S brand's fish cakes.

560
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,320
- Block it firmly.
- With fish cakes.

561
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,720
- Firmly.
- Block it with fish cakes.

562
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,460
You have to block gunggei obudengi
to prevent water leaks.

563
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,670
(Level Two: You have to block
gunggei obudengi...)

564
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,440
(to prevent water leaks.)

565
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,030
Let me answer. You have to block
a hole thoroughly...

566
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,500
- to prevent water leaks.
- To prevent water leaks.

567
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,950
- That must be correct.
- It's very close to the answer.

568
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,470
It's the correct answer.

569
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,850
- Block a hole...
- Firmly?

570
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,980
- Thoroughly?
- I already tried "thoroughly."

571
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,590
- Block a hole...
- Properly?

572
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,690
- Block a hole...
- Like this.

573
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,960
- Properly.
- tightly.

574
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Like this. Wrap around it like this.

575
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,220
- Like this.
- Or...

576
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,490
- wrap around it twice.
- Properly.

577
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,020
It's so close to the meaning,
but you have to say the exact word.

578
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,290
Let me answer.

579
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,460
Block a hole...

580
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,800
Let's say there's a hole here,
Hyung In, okay?

581
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,710
So it should fit the hole perfectly.
You know what I'm saying, right?

582
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,650
- Turn off the water properly?
- Watch this carefully.

583
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,450
- So this hole...
- Let me answer.

584
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,450
- Block a hole...
- Here's an example of "obudengi."

585
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,690
- Okay.
- "Obudengi."

586
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,120
All I can think of is "fairly."

587
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,320
Se Chan read all the books
in the library obudengi,

588
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
- but he's still an empty head.
- Let me answer.

589
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,250
Completely.

590
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,720
("Obudengi" means "completely.")

591
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,950
- That must be correct.
- Completely.

592
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,450
- Block a hole completely.
- Block a hole completely.

593
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,600
(Correct)

594
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,830
The answer is "completely."

595
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,190
- The answer is "completely."
- Right.

596
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,720
- Completely.
- "Obudengi."

597
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,760
- "Obudengi."
- Right.

598
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,960
(Team Se Chan got a question right
for the 1st time after 4 questions.)

599
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,700
- It was a difficult question.
- It was so difficult.

600
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,000
- It was really difficult.
- "Obudengi."

601
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,800
- He's the son of Jeongseon.
- It was difficult.

602
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,530
Hey, empty that completely.

603
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,110
Hey, you should block it completely.

604
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,500
- You should block it completely.
- Record completely everything.

605
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,540
Every cameraman should do so.

606
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,710
You should all record
completely everything.

607
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,040
I'm sorry, but are you an idiot?

608
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,210
- Are you?
- No, he's an idiot, not me.

609
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,390
I'm not an idiot.

610
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,630
- He's an idiot, not me.
- Obudengi.

611
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,360
- He's wearing a stupid hat.
- I'll give you the next question.

612
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,930
I ko when Suk Jin eolbun.

613
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,220
"Ko?"

614
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,030
- "Eolbun?"
- "Eolbun..."

615
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,640
- Does it mean "to shake the legs?"
- "I ko when Suk Jin eolbun."

616
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,300
- "Eolbun" must mean...
- Let me answer.

617
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
I think it means
"to shake the legs."

618
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,940
I hate it
when Suk Jin acts arrogant.

619
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,180
(Could it be the correct answer?)

620
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,650
- Oh.
- I think it's correct.

621
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,890
(Jong Kook got it right
at the first attempt.)

622
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,210
Right? That's what it means, right?

623
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,890
- Did you live in Gangwon Province?
- No.

624
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,980
- How did you know that?
- I didn't.

625
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,690
I guessed based on the nuance.

626
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,090
- "Eolbun..."
- Right.

627
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,390
- "I ko when Suk Jin eolbun."
- I just...

628
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,630
Yes. That's how it sounded to me.

629
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,370
- I guessed "ko" meant "to hate."
- I'm impressed.

630
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,930
- How did he know?
- How did you get it right?

631
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,640
- It just sounded like that.
- We lost.

632
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,100
- It's a complete defeat.
- Really?

633
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,640
- You have no more questions?
- We do have more questions.

634
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,070
Then shall we try
just one more question?

635
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,140
- Yes.
- Okay.

636
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,530
- Then let's...
- This is fun.

637
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,730
- Give us 5 points.
- Right. Give us 5 points.

638
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,910
- Or four points.
- Four points.

639
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,350
- That's ridiculous.
- We'll be tied.

640
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,850
Then our efforts will
go down the drain.

641
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,880
- They all do so on a variety show.
- Just four points.

642
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,280
- But this is too much.
- Come on.

643
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,390
- I would understand...
- Listen to me.

644
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,190
if the score was 5 to 3.

645
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,710
If we get four points,
the two teams will be tied.

646
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,780
- Then we'll have the final match.
- Come on.

647
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,900
Suk Jin,
I hate it when you do that.

648
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,430
(The smart frog used the expression
she learned right away.)

649
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,670
Then slap one another in the face.

650
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,030
That's ridiculous.

651
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,170
(Slapping)

652
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,440
(They do so right away.)

653
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,870
(They build teamwork
by massaging one another's cheeks.)

654
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,230
That's funny. Okay.

655
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,610
That's enough. You can stop it.

656
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,500
- It was good enough, right?
- Yes. That was good enough.

657
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,580
- Okay.
- Let's do as you suggested.

658
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,880
We slapped one another.
So we're good now, right?

659
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,820
You should at least do that
to get another chance.

660
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,690
- Of course, we'd do it right away.
- That was funny.

661
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,150
- You'll get four points this time.
- Yes.

662
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,280
- We're so nice.
- That's too much.

663
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,660
- Let's make it two points.
- Let's do that next time.

664
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,320
- We slapped one another.
- Let's make it three points.

665
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,690
- Let's make it three points.
- Four points.

666
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,950
- Or else, it'll be pointless.
- Okay. Let's do that.

667
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,360
- I'll give you the question.
- Yes.

668
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:51,760
Suk Jin has a lot of gichaengi.

669
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,900
- Let me answer. Laziness.
- Let me answer.

670
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,940
- Suk Jin has...
- Suk Jin coughs a lot.

671
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,260
- Let me answer. I know this.
- I said, laziness.

672
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,470
- Let me answer. I know this.
- Go ahead.

673
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,350
Suk Jin has a lot of earwax.

674
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,850
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

675
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,540
(Correct)

676
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,970
- Okay.
- We won.

677
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,350
- I knew what the word means.
- It means "earwax."

678
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,210
- They call it gichaengi.
- What was it called?

679
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,480
- Gichaengi.
- Gichaengi.

680
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,360
- Doesn't it mean "laziness?"
- I thought it meant "laziness."

681
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,780
- I could guess the meaning too.
- My grandma uses the word.

682
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,860
(So Min who used to be called
an underdog surprised everyone.)

683
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,630
They made questions
based on the facts.

684
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,990
People might think it's true.

685
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,640
The viewers might think
that it's true.

686
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,900
(Seok Sam may have a lot of earwax,
but he doesn't get angry easily.)

687
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,340
They say,
"Right will prevail in the end."

688
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,940
- You won after all.
- That's right.

689
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,470
- Had we won...
- Right.

690
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,640
- They would've been upset.
- That's right.

691
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,880
- The mission ended.
- They would've gone wild.

692
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,610
- I'm relieved.
- It's 7 to 6. Team Haha wins.

693
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,820
- Okay!
- Oh, boy.

694
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,940
Team Haha will receive 13 potatoes.

695
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,820
Team Se Chan, the losing team, will
receive ten potatoes.

696
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,120
Ten potatoes?
They got three more potatoes.

697
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,280
- Only three more potatoes.
- That's not bad.

698
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,130
- We should win the next game.
- Right.

699
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,250
- It's not bad.
- It's not a big difference.

700
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,100
- Then let's move on.
- Okay.

701
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,020
- We'll stay here?
- Yes, we'll stay here.

702
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,190
- That's great.
- Good.

703
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,170
Before we begin,

704
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,790
please go to the kitchen
and bring one item you want.

705
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,910
- Bring an item here?
- Just one?

706
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,260
Yes, one for each.

707
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,200
(They'll choose an item without
knowing what game they'll play.)

708
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,800
- One for each?
- I like this.

709
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,200
- What do you think of this?
- That's nice.

710
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Right?

711
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,420
- We'll pick one more item.
- Should I choose a clay pot?

712
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,540
Jae Suk, wouldn't tongs be helpful?

713
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,820
- What should we choose?
- Tongs?

714
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,210
- A tool.
- Okay. Let's take them.

715
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,590
We can pick one more item.

716
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,510
Let's take a ladle with these.

717
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,550
With those?

718
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,050
Jae Suk, can we choose
an alcoholic drink?

719
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,360
- What?
- Shall we take something wide too?

720
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,720
- Something wide?
- An alcoholic drink?

721
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,860
(Haha picked an alcoholic drink
as Ji Hyo said.)

722
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,520
- Is it allowed?
- Yes.

723
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,960
This is it.

724
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,600
(Will the drink bottle be helpful
in the next game?)

725
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,910
Suk Jin, what about this?

726
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,140
- That?
- It's really big.

727
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,180
Jae Suk took two small items.

728
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,340
- Did he? Okay.
- Yes.

729
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,500
Let's take a big item too
just in case.

730
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,350
Then I'll pick this item.

731
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,470
- What is it?
- I picked this.

732
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,710
- It's pretty.
- It's a kettle.

733
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,920
- This is what I chose.
- I picked this kettle.

734
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,210
Did you bring an alcoholic drink?

735
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,160
- Did you?
- Yes, I did.

736
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,190
An alcoholic drink?

737
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,430
- What about this?
- I already picked it.

738
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,950
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo is fiddling
with something in the corner.)

739
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,870
Ma'am, can I use this
and give you back? What is this?

740
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
I'll give you back later.

741
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,140
- I can throw it very far.
- Yes.

742
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,490
- Oh, my. What's that?
- What is it?

743
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,530
- What's that?
- She wants to use it.

744
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,700
- She wants to use this?
- My gosh.

745
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,380
She picked that?

746
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,770
- This box?
- Yes.

747
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,770
- What's in it?
- What's in the box?

748
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,440
We received it as a gift.
She wants to borrow it.

749
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,240
- You received it as a gift?
- Yes.

750
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,510
- Really?
- Ji Hyo...

751
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,150
Yes. You can borrow it.

752
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,240
It's quite heavy.

753
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,480
She picked pears.

754
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,320
So Min picked a similar item...
No, I was wrong.

755
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,620
Oh, no. We picked the same item.

756
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,780
(I picked a kettle too.)

757
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,660
- Come on. Don't do that.
- It's okay.

758
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,960
- But the size is different.
- Why?

759
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,790
(She suddenly acts cute.)

760
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,690
What was that, So Min?

761
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,870
"Why?"

762
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,760
I'll explain the rules to you now.

763
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,030
At the 2018 Winter Olympics
that was held in Gangwon Province,

764
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,440
(Curling, the hottest event at
the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics)

765
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,540
- curling was very popular.
- Oh, curling?

766
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,240
So we prepared this mission.

767
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
It's The Kitchen Curling.

768
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,040
- Curling?
- We picked the right items.

769
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,510
- With this ladle...
- We brought this too.

770
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,780
Oh, boy.

771
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,980
- How can we play curling with this?
- Exactly.

772
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,050
- You'll use the items you brought.
- Okay.

773
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,660
The members of each team will
take turns.

774
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,900
The closer to the center
of the target your item stops,

775
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,760
the higher your score gets.

776
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
(They should get their items
to hit the center of the target.)

777
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,070
- He picked a good item.
- That's the best.

778
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,800
After everyone's attempt,
we'll tally the scores...

779
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,230
of the spots
where your items stopped.

780
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,230
- Got it.
- Right.

781
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,940
- Please bring the curling court.
- It doesn't fit, right?

782
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,350
The box full of pears...
That's really good.

783
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,150
- It can cover more than one ring.
- Right.

784
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,850
- We can just make space here.
- Yes.

785
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,950
Hey, this is too big...

786
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,550
I knew you knew that.

787
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,860
What could my score be
if it covers the whole area?

788
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
(The target is too small compared
to Suk Jin's large basket.)

789
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,290
I'll be at a disadvantage.

790
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,130
- What do you mean?
- Where should it stop?

791
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,720
It's very wide.

792
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,670
I'm not sure if it's good or bad.

793
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,170
(Haha practices throwing
his makgeolli bottle.)

794
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,610
- You picked a good item.
- It's easy to throw, right?

795
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,170
I think it's good.

796
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,530
(Haha picked it because he likes
alcohol, and he got lucky.)

797
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,640
It's really good.

798
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,850
The two team captains will play
rock-paper-scissors.

799
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,470
The winner will decide
whether to go first or not.

800
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,540
- Okay.
- Okay.

801
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,940
- Come here.
- You should win.

802
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,420
- Isn't it better not to go first?
- I think...

803
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,420
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

804
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,850
- Okay. They will go first.
- He won. That's better.

805
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,040
- You want them to go first?
- Yes.

806
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,120
Who is the first player
on your team?

807
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,250
- Okay.
- So Min will go first.

808
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,250
- Must I use only mine?
- I can beat her.

809
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,430
- You can only use yours.
- I see.

810
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,330
- Can I use only the lid?
- Yes, you can.

811
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,720
- Really?
- But we can't throw it...

812
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,760
- We're not allowed to throw it.
- That's correct.

813
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,460
- You must slide it.
- We can only slide it.

814
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,870
Curling.

815
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,870
(So Min, Team Haha,
Stone: Kettle lid)

816
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,260
(The cautious shooting stance)

817
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,970
- Roll it.
- Just roll it.

818
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,000
- It will be funnier.
- Right, it'll be funnier.

819
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,610
(She slid it!)

820
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,040
- Nice!
- Nice! Great job!

821
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,540
(It didn't reach the target.)

822
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,240
She didn't say, "Start."

823
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,250
- I didn't say, "Start."
- She didn't say, "Start."

824
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,450
- She didn't say, "Start."
- Here you go again.

825
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,330
- That doesn't count.
- Gosh, seriously.

826
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,890
- You know she didn't say it.
- That's not fair.

827
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,600
- But she didn't say, "Start."
- That's not fair.

828
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,660
- Okay. Here we go.
- Gosh.

829
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,690
- Start.
- Seriously.

830
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,490
- Hey, don't forget to say, "Start."
- Didn't you say, "Start?"

831
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,570
- Start.
- She stepped on the line too.

832
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,070
Why is it brown?

833
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,260
Gosh, So Min.

834
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,000
Hey, you shouldn't do it like that.

835
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,870
- So Min.
- What do you mean by that?

836
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,270
- How should she do it then?
- Okay!

837
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,880
(It fell out of the court.)

838
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,040
- He said she wasn't doing it right.
- You said it.

839
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,940
- You did a great job.
- How should she do it?

840
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,710
- When you slide it...
- This one counts. Please leave it.

841
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,590
- Let's move on.
- Next, please.

842
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,620
That's much better.

843
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,280
- We must do it inside the line?
- I should've used that.

844
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,890
- It's okay if your hand crosses it.
- I won't say, "Start."

845
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,780
- I'll practice once.
- Then... For example...

846
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,950
We can let our hands cross the line.

847
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,160
- Oh, our hands are okay?
- Yes.

848
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,960
- But not your body.
- Okay.

849
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,370
Okay!

850
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,370
- Nice.
- Okay!

851
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,790
(It stopped inside the house.)

852
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,170
- He didn't say, "Start."
- He said it.

853
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,960
- Did he?
- He said, "Start."

854
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,340
- It's your turn.
- Okay.

855
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,440
- Next.
- Who's next?

856
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,470
- Haha?
- Just push it.

857
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,470
- Haha?
- I'll go next.

858
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,120
(I got away with it.)

859
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,350
- Oh, that...
- We're all serious about this game.

860
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,240
You should make sure
it moves in the right direction.

861
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,550
- But this bottle...
- It doesn't move straight.

862
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,980
- Hey.
- Why don't you just have a drink?

863
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,860
Roll it gently and make it stop
right next to the lid.

864
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,160
- If I roll it gently, it swerves.
- Does it stop?

865
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,720
- Oh, it swerves?
- It doesn't move straight.

866
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
You should think about
how it would swerve.

867
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,430
Think of the lie before sliding it.

868
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,730
- "Lie?"
- Think that you're playing golf.

869
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,170
- Curve it slightly.
- Roll it gently.

870
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,800
- Oh, no. You rolled it hard.
- Oh, boy.

871
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,370
(Will it turn out
as the makgeolli man planned?)

872
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,380
- Please stop in the house.
- You rolled it too hard.

873
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,940
- Right.
- Hey, it didn't curve a lot.

874
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,380
- It didn't.
- It barely swerved.

875
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,320
- It almost rolled straight.
- What a shame.

876
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,510
- It barely swerved.
- Move, kiddo

877
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,740
- Here I go
- See? I knew it.

878
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,550
- Move, kiddo
- He's at an advantage.

879
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,480
Which one of these should I use?

880
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,950
Here we go, let's do this

881
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,690
(The beggar singer
suddenly got excited.)

882
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,720
Use this one. It'll be funnier.

883
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,600
- Which one?
- This one.

884
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
I can do that.

885
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,960
- Use the ladle.
- He has two attempts anyway.

886
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,460
- He has two attempts anyway.
- I am Gung Ye

887
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,000
(It's hard to see
why he's so excited.)

888
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,770
- Then I'll go with this one.
- Go with the ladle.

889
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,650
- Yes. Go with the ladle.
- I can do this.

890
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,620
- It will be funny.
- I can do this.

891
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,650
You're stepping on the line.

892
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,350
- He's stepping on the line.
- Is this okay?

893
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,890
- Yes, your hand can cross the line.
- This is okay, right?

894
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,120
- This is okay.
- Just don't step on the line.

895
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,660
(Will it reach the center
without hitting Se Chan's stone?)

896
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,050
- Nice... Gosh.
- Okay.

897
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,490
Gosh. That was close.

898
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,720
What was that?

899
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,860
Okay. I know how fast it should be.

900
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,720
- What a shame.
- I figured out the speed.

901
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,490
It must be very light.

902
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,570
A gourd scoop is light.

903
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,970
(He slid it!)

904
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,540
My gosh. Hey!

905
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,420
(Taken aback)

906
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,240
- We won
- Why did it stop there?

907
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,040
Wait. I didn't say, "Start."

908
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,210
- I didn't say, "Start."
- Come on.

909
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,850
- You can't try again.
- But I didn't say, "Start."

910
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,480
- Next.
- Why didn't it go farther?

911
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,780
- Seok Sam, you're up next.
- Did all of you try?

912
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,890
- No, it's your turn.
- Me?

913
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,980
- I slid it as hard as Jae Suk did.
- Okay. Here we go.

914
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,520
- Get ready.
- Start.

915
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,950
Wait. Oh, you have two chances.

916
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,520
- Yes, you have 4 members.
- We picked 4 items.

917
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,630
I think I can make it
stop inside the house.

918
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,900
- I can do this.
- Make it hit the center.

919
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,960
(Jong Kook, Se Chan)

920
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,600
- It's inside the house!
- Okay!

921
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,730
Eight points!
Make it hit the center.

922
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,880
(It landed in the house
without touching the gourd scoop.)

923
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,940
(Good shot, beggar singer.)

924
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,680
- Ji Hyo, just push it hard.
- Next!

925
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,470
- Push them all out.
- Push it hard.

926
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,620
Could she pull it off?

927
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,510
- Put it on the floor.
- Could she push them out?

928
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,040
- Push it hard.
- Put it down on the floor.

929
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,050
- Don't throw it, but slide it.
- No. Further than that.

930
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,950
- Further.
- Grab the knot.

931
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,780
- And slide it hard.
- Further.

932
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,450
- It's impossible.
- Ji Hyo, you can go further.

933
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,250
- Could she pull it off?
- You can go further than that.

934
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,330
- Say, "Start."
- Further.

935
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,460
- Hey, stop.
- Oh, no.

936
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,070
- Ji Hyo, I think...
- You shouldn't start from there.

937
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,490
- Don't forget to say, "Start."
- I think...

938
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,170
- That's right. Slide it.
- you should run toward the line...

939
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,530
and slide it like this.

940
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,170
- That's throwing.
- Right?

941
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,170
We're playing curling.

942
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,910
- You shouldn't throw it in curling.
- Come here.

943
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,470
(Refuting)

944
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,740
That's what they do in curling.

945
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,040
Run from there.

946
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,240
That's throwing.

947
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,940
- That's not allowed.
- Slide it hard.

948
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,270
Say, "Start."

949
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,590
- Start.
- She said it.

950
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,320
- Start.
- Let's go.

951
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,420
Be careful.

952
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,280
- Good. Oh, boy.
- Oh, dear.

953
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,900
(The box pushed the gourd scoop!)

954
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,370
(Will she turn the game around?)

955
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
- Oh, gosh.
- Okay.

956
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,880
(It ended up pushing Team Se Chan's
tongs to the ten-point spot!)

957
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,180
(What a shame.)

958
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,880
Thank you

959
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,680
- Did I fail?
- Ten points!

960
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,970
We got ten points thanks to her.

961
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:03,010
- They pushed our tongs.
- We got ten points

962
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,850
The score is 15 to 6.

963
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,690
Team Se Chan wins.

964
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,550
- Okay.
- Okay.

965
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,450
- Let them win this time.
- Thank you.

966
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,050
We'll begin the second round now.

967
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,130
- Yes.
- Bring one item you like...

968
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,720
from the kitchen
as you did in the first round.

969
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,330
- Should we pick something else?
- You can use it if you want.

970
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,670
Are we going to play curling again?

971
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,070
You'll play a different game.

972
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,300
We'll play a different game.
It could be jegichagi.

973
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,230
I'll pick something flat this time.

974
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,230
Shall I take this?

975
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,840
- I'll take something like this.
- You should.

976
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,500
- Shall I take this?
- Yes.

977
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,580
- It's easy to roll.
- Okay.

978
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,620
Then I'll take a cup.

979
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,710
It must be different from curling.

980
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,480
- I'll find something round.
- I have a feeling...

981
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,590
that it'll be very different
from curling.

982
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,250
- We won't have to roll it.
- That's correct.

983
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,750
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

984
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,750
I'm back with an item.
Let's have some fun.

985
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,330
Let's do this.

986
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,360
(A restaurant partition)

987
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,490
Hey, this is...

988
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,720
(A restaurant partition)

989
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,260
Let's have a blast.

990
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,030
We won!

991
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,370
I picked a good one.

992
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,700
Seeing that the staff members are
laughing,

993
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,940
- this will make people laugh.
- We don't know the game we'll play.

994
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,970
I brought this partition.

995
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,680
Okay! That's good.

996
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,350
I brought this. I didn't know
what game we'll play, but...

997
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,420
Okay.

998
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,510
I made my choice.

999
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,780
- I wonder what game we'll play.
- It's cool.

1000
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,890
- You all brought an item, right?
- Yes.

1001
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,450
(So everyone selected an item.)

1002
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,630
We brought items.

1003
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,490
The game you'll play this time...
Please bring it now.

1004
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,260
I guess
we won't play curling this time.

1005
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,260
What is it?

1006
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,130
We won't play table tennis, right?

1007
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,230
No way.

1008
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,460
- We won't play table tennis, right?
- I don't think so.

1009
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,960
If I had to play table tennis
with this...

1010
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,670
- Hey, we'll play table tennis.
- Right.

1011
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,610
- Gosh, we'll play table tennis.
- No way.

1012
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,350
- This is driving me nuts.
- Gosh.

1013
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,350
No wonder I had a bad feeling.

1014
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,240
How will Ji Hyo play table tennis
with a spoon?

1015
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,350
- It really is table tennis.
- I brought the perfect item.

1016
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,590
Gosh, this is crazy.

1017
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,190
- I picked a good one.
- I can't believe this.

1018
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,320
This is good
for playing table tennis.

1019
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,860
(Except for Ji Hyo, everyone
on Team Haha made good choices.)

1020
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,330
Gosh, this is crazy.

1021
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,950
It'll be hard to play table tennis
with both of them.

1022
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,630
- Yours is the best.
- Right. Mine is the best.

1023
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,520
Gangwon Province has become...

1024
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,440
the mecca of table tennis.

1025
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,340
- Really?
- That's why we prepared this game.

1026
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,610
It's a 2-on-2 table tennis game.

1027
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,910
- Okay!
- A 2-on-2 game.

1028
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,470
- Okay.
- We watched...

1029
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,650
the 1988 Summer Olympics
when we were kids.

1030
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,120
The 1st team to win 21 points wins.

1031
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,350
And you can change players once
whenever you want.

1032
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,710
- Whenever we want? Okay.
- Got it.

1033
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,360
(The 1st team to win 21 points wins.
They can change players once.)

1034
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,860
But we don't have to change players,
right?

1035
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,160
- On our team...
- You must change players once.

1036
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
We have a referee on our team.

1037
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,900
There's no referee there.
You're all players.

1038
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,520
They should be divided
into two pairs.

1039
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,670
- As soon as the game begins,
- No.

1040
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,140
- let's switch...
- You and I can...

1041
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,570
- right after winning one point.
- play alone.

1042
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,340
- No. They must play as well.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1043
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,700
- That's not what I'm saying.
- We must change players once.

1044
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,840
- We'll let them just stand still.
- My gosh.

1045
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,030
No, I'll play the game.

1046
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,700
I heard that it was okay
for them not to hit a ball.

1047
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,040
- You're right. But I think...
- I'll hit a ball too.

1048
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,710
- we should let them play first...
- Yes.

1049
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,940
and as soon as the game begins,
we'll replace them.

1050
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,980
Why?

1051
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,040
Or else, we'll have to give up
and lose some points.

1052
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,710
So Min, I think
they have no expectations for you.

1053
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,390
So Min.

1054
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,160
If you were on our team,
we'd treat you as our star player.

1055
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,280
- Of course.
- Obviously.

1056
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,600
Why let yourself
get treated that way?

1057
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,860
When you're as good as you are.

1058
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,490
- Should I give them the stickers?
- So Min,

1059
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,720
- that's not it.
- Of course.

1060
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,170
This is a team game.

1061
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,870
Don't you know the phrase,
"There's no I in team?"

1062
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,440
I know, but you...

1063
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,530
- Ji Hyo, I'm sorry.
- I'm curious though.

1064
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,910
Why do you like table tennis?

1065
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,230
(Why do you like table tennis?)

1066
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,230
Tell me why you like table tennis.

1067
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,300
Why?

1068
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,210
I just like playing games
with you, that's all.

1069
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,320
Oh, I see.

1070
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,850
- How about a practice round?
- Sounds good.

1071
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,850
- Just a second.
- Don't you have the ball?

1072
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,450
Are you here to install that?

1073
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,820
- Are you a handyman?
- Just a second.

1074
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,220
- He's a handyman.
- How about this?

1075
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,690
Lift it up like so.

1076
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,450
You're covering up the space though.

1077
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,920
- You need to hold it up.
- Like this?

1078
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,900
Yes, hold it up. It's just as funny.

1079
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,590
Haha, you're in my space.

1080
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,530
Haha, you're in my space.

1081
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,630
Nice.

1082
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,780
- It blocks everything.
- It can block anything.

1083
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,130
You only need to let it hover.

1084
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,200
- Isn't it heavy?
- It is.

1085
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,400
This is perfect though.

1086
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,320
- That...
- This is perfect though.

1087
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,550
(Spinning)

1088
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,950
(Drop)

1089
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,010
- Are you supposed to be a magician?
- What's wrong?

1090
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,280
Nice, right?

1091
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,190
- Isn't this allowed?
- We can utilize what we have.

1092
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,550
- Wait.
- Why is this not allowed?

1093
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,090
It's like he's grabbing the ball.

1094
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,820
Why is this not allowed?

1095
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,700
- How many times did it bounce?
- I'll let it bounce once.

1096
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,920
That's a cup.

1097
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,670
- It was funny but...
- Don't be so harsh.

1098
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,200
- How many times did it bounce?
- I'll let it bounce once.

1099
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,360
(Meanwhile, So Min practices.)

1100
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,700
- No, not like that.
- It was funny but...

1101
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,970
Bounce it off the center.

1102
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,360
No, aim it upward.

1103
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,300
Hold on. Don't show your annoyance.

1104
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,970
No, that wasn't the case.

1105
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,110
- So Min, it's okay.
- I wasn't annoyed.

1106
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,150
Don't show your annoyance.

1107
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,880
- That really wasn't it.
- Seriously.

1108
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,320
So Min, aim it upward.

1109
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,510
- Yes, upward.
- Not downward.

1110
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,380
Let me demonstrate.

1111
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,990
- Can you pass me the ball?
- Yes, upward.

1112
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,760
- I'll demonstrate.
- Upward.

1113
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,260
- Just focus on receiving the ball.
- Let me demonstrate.

1114
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,360
Here and...

1115
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,880
- Like that.
- Aim it upward.

1116
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,360
- I know, Haha.
- Not downward.

1117
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,760
I know, darn it!

1118
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,820
Downward, So Min.

1119
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,030
Give it a try.

1120
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,220
- Push it upward.
- In 2, 3.

1121
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,260
- Not like that!
- Nice.

1122
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,300
- It didn't bounce high enough.
- She can't seem to do it.

1123
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,860
- Let's do this, then.
- It didn't bounce high enough.

1124
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,440
- I'll try again.
- Upward.

1125
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,570
- Yes!
- That's right.

1126
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,280
- That's it.
- That was great.

1127
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,800
- That's how you do it. Let's go.
- Okay.

1128
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,220
You and Jong Kook will go first.

1129
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,570
- All right.
- Maybe like this.

1130
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,280
- This will see who gets to serve.
- Do it.

1131
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,690
- Who gets to serve.
- And go.

1132
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,510
- Nice.
- This is how you do it!

1133
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,110
- I...
- Upward.

1134
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,190
- She...
- Take this...

1135
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,190
- and do this.
- Actually,

1136
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,920
- the box isn't hard enough.
- Aim at So Min.

1137
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,990
- Send the ball her way.
- You get it, right?

1138
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,570
- Okay!
- It's still our serve.

1139
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,490
- Push it hard.
- The game begins.

1140
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,990
They get to serve first.
Whoever scores 21 points wins.

1141
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,840
- Okay.
- We've won.

1142
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,670
(Team Haha scores the first point.)

1143
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,300
- Okay.
- We've won.

1144
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,950
- We won.
- That's 1 to 0.

1145
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,240
I knew it didn't count.

1146
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,880
- We get to serve.
- I knew it didn't count.

1147
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,420
- That game was already over.
- I'll move out of the way.

1148
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,190
- Who's serving?
- Okay.

1149
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,190
(Team Se Chan versus Team Haha)

1150
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,860
- That game was already over.
- I'll move out of the way.

1151
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,260
- Yes!
- Okay.

1152
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,700
- Get a grip on yourself.
- Darn it.

1153
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,900
(Sliding in)

1154
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,030
Okay, that's 2 to 0.

1155
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,170
What's with you?

1156
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,700
- Okay.
- That's 3 to 0.

1157
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,400
- Okay.
- That's 3 to 0.

1158
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,240
- I'm exhausted.
- It's 2 to 1.

1159
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,800
We won that point.

1160
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,110
- Oh, we didn't.
- It's 2 to 1.

1161
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,510
This is blocking my view.

1162
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,670
- But...
- Seriously?

1163
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,950
Set it down and rest, then.

1164
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,070
- It's too heavy.
- Gosh.

1165
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,050
- What do you think you're doing?
- Do you know what's funny?

1166
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,690
So Min's determined
to do well today.

1167
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,860
- She's in my space.
- You're doing great.

1168
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,650
(The serve is aimed at So Min.)

1169
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,590
- Okay.
- I get it now.

1170
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,900
- Can we switch places?
- Can't one ask for a rally?

1171
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,130
- Hold it like this.
- I blame my position.

1172
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,340
- It's better to hold the handle.
- It's 2 to 2.

1173
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,700
- It's 2 to 2.
- The score is at 2 to 2.

1174
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,400
(Deep breaths)

1175
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,630
The score is at 2 to 2.

1176
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,170
- Okay.
- Nice.

1177
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,050
(Partition Boy manages to score.)

1178
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,420
- It's 3 to 2.
- But that...

1179
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,110
Should this be allowed?

1180
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,650
(The next round)

1181
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,690
It's too small.

1182
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,360
Why don't you receive the ball?

1183
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,950
- Me?
- It's 4 to 3.

1184
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,030
I can't though.

1185
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,300
(Partition Boy works out alone.)

1186
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,320
- Gosh.
- Nice!

1187
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,700
- Good.
- Okay.

1188
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,820
I have gotten the hang of it.

1189
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,360
- Jae Suk, wait.
- Move!

1190
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,440
- Just a second.
- Move it!

1191
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,030
Let me rest a little.

1192
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,170
Let me rest a little.

1193
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,950
Okay, nice one.

1194
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,280
Okay!

1195
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,340
Okay, nice one.

1196
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,970
(It bounces twice.)

1197
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,450
- Okay!
- It's 6 to 4.

1198
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,690
- So Min, please.
- It's 6 to 4.

1199
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,550
- Did you have to hit my racket?
- Jong Kook, come on.

1200
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,880
Let me hit the ball, will you?

1201
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,190
- All right.
- Let her receive it.

1202
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,420
- Alternate serves.
- You get to serve now.

1203
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,150
- I see.
- Do you want to serve?

1204
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,920
- So Min, go ahead.
- Let's receive this.

1205
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,450
(So Min is given an opportunity.)

1206
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,630
- Look at So Min.
- Do I hit it immediately...

1207
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,820
- after throwing it?
- No.

1208
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,670
- Do I hit it immediately after?
- No.

1209
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,530
It should bounce once here and here.

1210
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,970
- What...
- Like this.

1211
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,070
- I knew it.
- Hold on.

1212
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,200
I get that you're enthusiastic,
but watch this.

1213
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,510
It should bounce once here first.

1214
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,700
Like this, So Min.

1215
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,950
Right. You can do this, So Min.

1216
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,740
- Haven't you been watching?
- You can do this.

1217
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,970
Do I bounce it once and then hit it?

1218
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,170
- Yes.
- No, not like that.

1219
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,920
- Bounce it off the racket first.
- I see.

1220
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,720
- Then, bounce it here and here.
- Okay.

1221
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,610
She can do it the easy way.

1222
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,220
- That's it.
- Nicely done.

1223
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,760
- Nice!
- That's how you do it.

1224
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,320
- Keep doing that.
- That's how it goes.

1225
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,590
It isn't easy to receive the ball.

1226
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,630
Do just that.

1227
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,030
- Bounce it here.
- Is she serving?

1228
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,170
- Okay.
- Gosh.

1229
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,170
(She immediately misses her serve.)

1230
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,670
(His patience has run out.)

1231
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,590
And that brings us to...

1232
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,860
It's too late.

1233
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,860
- We're switching players.
- No way!

1234
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,570
- Ji Hyo.
- Give it here.

1235
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,780
- Us too?
- Yes, let's switch players.

1236
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,170
- You and me.
- I'll get some rest.

1237
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,070
The cup was a terrible choice.

1238
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,780
It's annoying, isn't it?

1239
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,510
- We can switch once more.
- No, you can't.

1240
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,090
Both players can only
be switched once.

1241
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,820
Then play a little longer.

1242
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,550
- Ji Hyo, come on.
- A while longer?

1243
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,090
We need to run off with the game.

1244
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,090
As much surface as possible.

1245
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,550
Okay, like that.

1246
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,030
- That board...
- I know.

1247
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,360
(He's wrapping his hand with tape.)

1248
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,800
They're up to something.

1249
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,840
- They're up to something.
- Just a second.

1250
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,970
We're only using what we have.

1251
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,130
- We're making a racket.
- Yes, we're making a racket.

1252
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,130
- What on earth are they doing?
- Wait.

1253
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,200
- Good.
- Hold on.

1254
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,340
Let's do this.

1255
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,800
- This is what we had.
- We...

1256
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,010
Where's your cup?

1257
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,670
- We have two.
- Yes, two.

1258
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,880
This is what he brought,

1259
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,690
and this is the only way to use it.

1260
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,450
(Jae Suk's satisfied.)

1261
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,590
All right.

1262
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,920
Is that a loofah?

1263
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,550
Is that what it is?

1264
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,050
- Is it from Italy?
- It's a table tennis racket!

1265
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,300
- Is it a loofah from Italy?
- No, a table tennis racket.

1266
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,320
- I'll hold it this way.
- Is that better?

1267
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,070
- Show them.
- Send it So Min's way.

1268
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,360
- Go ahead.
- Send it So Min's way.

1269
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,800
Make it go wide. Nice.

1270
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,840
- Okay!
- I...

1271
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,010
Go, So Min!

1272
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,740
Nice. Okay!

1273
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,900
(Alone, So Min
loses them ten points.)

1274
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,170
Nice, So Min.

1275
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,340
- You're the best.
- You don't have to hit anything.

1276
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,650
You're the best on their team.

1277
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,190
- So Min, this will be easier.
- It's 11 to 10.

1278
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,450
I only ask because I'm curious.

1279
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,150
Is it wrong
to stop her from playing...

1280
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,320
when she's this poor at it?

1281
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,380
Is it wrong
to stop her from playing...

1282
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,490
when she's this poor at it?

1283
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,320
I only ask because I'm curious.

1284
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,860
I ask the viewers
because I'm curious.

1285
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,670
- When she's this poor at it...
- When this is the case...

1286
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,840
- She's your best player.
- It's like this.

1287
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,970
So Min's opinion matters.
You want to play, don't you?

1288
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,260
Yes.

1289
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,360
(The player wants to compete.)

1290
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,240
- Then she should.
- Go ahead.

1291
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,740
Who's at fault? Her or us?

1292
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,400
You'll agree to this too, right?

1293
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,380
- She should get to play.
- If you were me...

1294
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,970
She should get to play.

1295
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,420
- But...
- Hold on a second.

1296
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,920
I have something to complain about.

1297
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,450
I don't get to hit the ball
that I know I can send over.

1298
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,690
The previous one was easy enough.

1299
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,190
- How so?
- How was that hard?

1300
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,360
- It was doable.
- What are you talking about?

1301
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,530
- That was the easiest kind.
- But...

1302
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,700
- It was an easy one.
- It was impossible.

1303
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,950
What's more frustrating is that
we're the only ones annoyed.

1304
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,700
- The viewers aren't.
- Keep at it, then.

1305
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
You may not be annoyed, but I am.

1306
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,130
This is so unfair.

1307
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,800
- Let's keep playing.
- Okay.

1308
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,170
- It's 11 to 9.
- It's 11 to 9.

1309
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,240
- Go ahead.
- It's 11 to 10.

1310
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,570
- It's 11 to 10.
- It's 11 to 10.

1311
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,700
Get ready.

1312
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,610
Nice.

1313
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,670
How was that hard to hit?

1314
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,170
Nice.

1315
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,510
(So Min makes another mistake.)

1316
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,740
I stood here doing nothing
on purpose.

1317
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,690
I purposely stood by doing nothing.

1318
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,190
How was that hard to hit?

1319
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,990
- So Min, was it a difficult one?
- It's not that.

1320
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,550
You looked like you were going
to hit it but you didn't.

1321
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,920
- What are you talking about?
- It alarmed me.

1322
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,760
I stood still and only observed.

1323
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,420
You aren't annoyed, are you?

1324
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,130
But we are.

1325
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,920
Don't make us the bad guys, okay?

1326
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,840
- It's driving us crazy.
- How was that not easy?

1327
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,860
- You don't receive penalties.
- So Min's opinion matters.

1328
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,260
Do you want to play this game?

1329
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,630
- I do.
- Exactly!

1330
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,630
Tell me why
you want to play this game.

1331
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,130
- Who are you to want this?
- It's settled, then.

1332
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,610
Our team will lose.

1333
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,380
- "Who are you to want this?"
- Why did you step aside...

1334
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,340
when you always
hit the ball yourself?

1335
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,010
- Earlier...
- You wanted to hit the ball!

1336
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,590
You wanted to hit an easy one
that came your way.

1337
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,950
Are we going to play or not?

1338
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,010
That team is in shambles!

1339
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,990
- Let's play some table tennis.
- Go ahead.

1340
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,050
- Let's switch.
- Yes, let's switch.

1341
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,590
- Switch.
- Let's switch.

1342
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,820
Hold on a second.

1343
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,700
- Aim for Ji Hyo with the spoon.
- Okay.

1344
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,200
Let her suffer with her spoon.

1345
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,700
- Get ready with your spoon.
- He hid himself.

1346
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:28,940
- Get ready with your spoon.
- He concealed himself.

1347
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,030
Look at that.

1348
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,860
The prankster is at it again.

1349
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,110
He concealed himself.

1350
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,530
- So it begins.
- You can't tell when he'll serve.

1351
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,840
- Prankster Jae Suk.
- Whatever.

1352
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,550
- The prankster strikes.
- Is it time?

1353
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,550
- Is it time?
- Just get on with it.

1354
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,380
- Just get on with it.
- He has surfaced.

1355
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,380
(A sneak attack)

1356
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,110
- That's it.
- Nice!

1357
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,650
- I knew it.
- That was close.

1358
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:49,990
- The ball went out.
- Nice.

1359
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,190
I sliced it at too much of an angle.

1360
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,420
The ball went out.

1361
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,530
All right.

1362
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,990
(Haha's first offensive strike)

1363
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,130
Nice.

1364
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,590
Okay!

1365
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,900
- Okay.
- Let's calm down.

1366
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,200
- Have confidence.
- Got it.

1367
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,670
- What's the score?
- It's 13 to 14.

1368
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,170
A shadow casts over their faces.

1369
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,760
(Haha serves again.)

1370
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,800
- Gosh.
- Okay!

1371
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,300
- A shadow casts over their faces.
- Okay!

1372
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,800
Check out their faces.

1373
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,550
(He's no longer smiling.)

1374
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,840
All right.

1375
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,950
(Haha is on a roll,
and he serves again.)

1376
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,690
- Nice.
- There you go.

1377
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,880
(Haha makes up
for the points So Min lost.)

1378
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,190
- Good.
- Nicely done.

1379
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,110
- What's the score?
- It's 19 to 18.

1380
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,050
We only have two points to go.

1381
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,130
- Just 2 more points.
- That's 2 to go.

1382
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,450
- That's too bad.
- It was a good move.

1383
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,200
(They're in the end game now.)

1384
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,990
You should receive it.

1385
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,840
(Mr. Mole misses.)

1386
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,470
- It landed here.
- It's 19 to 19.

1387
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,010
- It's 19 to 19.
- Gosh, 19 to 19.

1388
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,570
It's a close match
although it's nothing great.

1389
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,300
They sent it over.

1390
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,670
(The ball heads Ji Hyo's way.)

1391
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,840
(Please!)

1392
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:53,150
(During practice, Ji Hyo
showed off her table tennis skills.)

1393
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,780
(Will she do the same
under pressure?)

1394
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,880
It's nothing great.

1395
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,150
- They sent it over.
- Ji Hyo.

1396
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,490
- Okay.
- Yes.

1397
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,650
(She failed to touch it.)

1398
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,650
(Current scores,
Team Se Chan: 20, Team Haha: 18)

1399
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,070
- One point.
- We scored one point.

1400
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,420
- They said it's deuce.
- It's too hard.

1401
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,800
It's hard.

1402
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,030
- Just end it at once.
- Just one more point.

1403
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,700
(Team Se Chan has to score
1 point to finish the game.)

1404
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,610
(Team Haha needs to score
2 times in a row.)

1405
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,970
- You should receive it.
- End it with the serve.

1406
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,970
- You should receive it.
- End it with the serve.

1407
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,740
Nice.

1408
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:20,610
End it with the serve.

1409
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,170
Nice.

1410
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,190
(At that moment,)

1411
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,550
(Haha's sudden smash)

1412
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,190
(Who will win this game?)

1413
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,820
- Yes!
- Yes!

1414
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,990
- Yes!
- Yes!

1415
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,420
(They won!)

1416
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,670
It was close.

1417
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,030
- Come on.
- Good job.

1418
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,940
Based on the final score,
Team Se Chan won.

1419
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,570
- Okay.
- Okay.

1420
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,610
- It's okay. We can win next time.
- We can win next time.

1421
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,070
Thank you very much.

1422
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,780
Team Se Chan that won
gets 13 potatoes.

1423
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,550
Team Haha that lost
gets 10 potatoes.

1424
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:56,720
- It's the same.
- Yes.

1425
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,990
- Okay.
- Move to the next mission place.

1426
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,490
- Let's go.
- Move.

1427
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,400
(They're singing in messy harmony
in the car.)

1428
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,700
(Immersed)

1429
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,300
It's a harmony match.

1430
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,470
Sing in harmony.

1431
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,510
- It's not filmed.
- He's a loser.

1432
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,740
- He keeps bullying me.
- He's a loser.

1433
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,800
- We should do well when they fail.
- It's not love

1434
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,240
You're singing my notes again.

1435
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,220
- Our encounter
- You should switch with Jong Kook.

1436
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,920
- Earlier, you said...
- Do you want to sing high?

1437
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,840
- It's not
- It's not

1438
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,090
- You should sing in harmony.
- Okay.

1439
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,320
(The tone-deaf member
butts in out of nowhere.)

1440
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,860
(He's the typical guy who is excited
by himself and keeps the mic.)

1441
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:46,800
Is he singing the right one,
Jong Kook?

1442
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,030
- Time is tinged with light
- Next to a singer...

1443
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,340
Why are you guys singing
with a singer between you?

1444
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,030
- They did well.
- But who is a singer?

1445
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,610
- My friend.
- How come he's a singer?

1446
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,670
- "How come he's a singer?"
- What is he then?

1447
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,470
- He's a gym trainer.
- What are you talking about?

1448
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,280
I'm a full-time singer.

1449
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,590
- That's your part-time job.
- A former singer?

1450
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,990
Didn't you go to karaoke?

1451
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,450
- How did you know?
- Where?

1452
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:13,050
She kept wanting to sing in harmony.

1453
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:14,900
- I went to karaoke.
- You went to karaoke recently.

1454
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,990
- The day before yesterday.
- I knew it.

1455
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,700
(Jae Suk found out.)

1456
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,490
I know you well.

1457
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,800
How did you know?

1458
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,090
There's no reason for you
to want to sing in harmony suddenly.

1459
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,340
- Right. She sang it somewhere.
- You sang it somewhere.

1460
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,400
- Who did you sing with?
- Who did you sing with?

1461
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,300
She sang this song 100 percent.
Didn't you sing this song?

1462
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,780
She must've sung it
with a guy younger than her.

1463
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,510
Hey. What's wrong, So Min?

1464
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,880
She sang it 100 percent.

1465
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,280
I guess you have a guy.

1466
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,150
- Say it here in Running Man.
- No. I sang with my friend.

1467
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,380
Don't jump to conclusions.

1468
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,780
- Right.
- I didn't jump to conclusions.

1469
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,760
- Just let her be.
- A crush.

1470
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,420
- Just let her be.
- No.

1471
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,420
What do you mean I jumped
to conclusions? That's what I want.

1472
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,260
- So just let her be.
- Don't even want anything for her.

1473
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,300
- Why not?
- Don't care about her love life.

1474
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,820
- Right. Don't go deep.
- Stay still.

1475
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,200
- For both So Min and Ji Hyo.
- Right. Don't be curious.

1476
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,940
- Don't care about her love life.
- Right.

1477
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,110
I don't have one.

1478
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,110
I don't have one,
but you guys are interrupting.

1479
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:03,300
I really don't have one.
But someone might be interested,

1480
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,740
- but can't approach because of you.
- It's possible.

1481
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,050
- It's really possible.
- We don't do it on purpose,

1482
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:11,150
but we're always filming
and close to So Min.

1483
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,990
The same goes for Ji Hyo. So...

1484
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,320
they might think,
"If I meet So Min,"

1485
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:18,130
- "I should get to know..."
- Right.

1486
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,550
"with the other guys around her."
It can be burdensome.

1487
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:24,260
- You can't date her secretly.
- You can't.

1488
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,630
And we can say our opinions.

1489
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,400
- We can say opinions at least.
- Yes, we can.

1490
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,800
It means sketchy guys...

1491
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,030
- shouldn't come.
- No.

1492
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,510
- No is a no.
- No.

1493
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:38,970
- That's true. That's cool,
- They're cool brothers.

1494
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,170
but I could just
want a casual relationship.

1495
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:42,550
- No.
- You can't.

1496
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,050
- We're not easy ones.
- Hey.

1497
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,220
You should focus
on variety shows now.

1498
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,150
- Of course.
- About holding hands,

1499
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,150
- you should do it after 100 days.
- Right. You can't do it.

1500
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,550
Kiss her after a year, you punk!

1501
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,720
I don't know who you are,

1502
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,900
- You can never do that.
- but if you have bad intentions,

1503
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,900
you're dead.

1504
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,760
- He's like a dad of a daughter.
- If you...

1505
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,240
Don't have your eye on her.
I won't sit still.

1506
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,030
Haha should be around
when we kiss though.

1507
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,900
- With a plastic bag on his head.
- I will be with you.

1508
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,110
- I'm invisible.
- He's invisible.

1509
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,920
- He has to be with us.
- It's a promise.

1510
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,420
And I'll be in the group chat too.
But I'll act like I'm not there.

1511
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,950
I won't send emojis.

1512
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,950
He's not there.

1513
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:23,690
- We can tell at a glance.
- And...

1514
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:24,990
- You can use a stethoscope.
- Stop.

1515
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,990
I said enough. I haven't seen anyone
for five years.

1516
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:29,990
- I can tell at a glance.
- Stop.

1517
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,470
Just get off.

1518
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,130
And if there's a girl
interested in Jong Kook...

1519
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:37,200
You get off too. Shut your mouth.

1520
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,030
- That's so random.
- You get off too. Shut your mouth.

1521
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,070
- Who are you talking to?
- Is he talking to me?

1522
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,280
- No.
- Who is he talking to?

1523
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,650
- No.
- Is he talking to me?

1524
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,780
Were you talking to someone
interested in me?

1525
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,780
Yes.

1526
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,150
Considering the timing,
he was talking to me.

1527
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,170
- Someone interested in me.
- No, it's not you.

1528
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,840
- Was it not me?
- The timing was...

1529
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,150
- Considering the timing, it's me.
- The timing was off.

1530
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:53,720
- He pointed his fingers.
- He said it was not you.

1531
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,050
- Of course not.
- He said it was not you.

1532
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,550
It was a coincidence
that I was talking and you...

1533
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,590
- spoke at the same time.
- Let me continue.

1534
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,860
- Okay.
- If you're interested in him...

1535
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,400
Did you not hear me, you punk?

1536
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,630
If you heard me, close your mouth.

1537
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:06,860
- Is it me?
- No.

1538
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,760
- No, it's not.
- It's someone else.

1539
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,900
- It's the timing.
- It's a misunderstanding.

1540
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,760
- Coincidentally, the timing is off.
- It's the timing.

1541
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,510
- It's someone else.
- When I speak, you speak too.

1542
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,740
- No. He was continuing.
- It's the timing.

1543
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,130
Anyway, this is funny.

1544
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,380
We've become a family.

1545
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,880
- That's so random.
- Hey.

1546
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,240
We've become a family.

1547
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,010
(Bursting into laughter)

1548
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,010
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

1549
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:29,110
Hey, you should be good
to your family before saying it.

1550
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,860
- We've become a family.
- Just be good to your family.

1551
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,450
- So we meddle in...
- Don't say we're a family.

1552
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,220
our sisters' love life.

1553
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,550
Have we become a family?

1554
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,760
- When did we become a family?
- Without realizing,

1555
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,200
we've become a family.
So we want So Min and Ji Hyo...

1556
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,360
- to meet nice guys.
- That sounded so fake just now.

1557
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,010
- He said we've become a family.
- What?

1558
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,670
- Wasn't it unnatural?
- I'll chase you...

1559
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:49,170
if you treat her badly.

1560
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,840
- You're lying.
- You're lying.

1561
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,840
- But...
- Let's play games.

1562
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,740
- Yes, let's do it.
- It was neat.

1563
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,490
(Sighing)

1564
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:59,720
You trash.

1565
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,050
He meant it.

1566
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,190
(The eldest brother said
a heart-warming word to them.)

1567
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,360
That was good.

1568
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,630
- He keeps trying to give a lecture.
- Right.

1569
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,720
(They're like family
to Seok Sam now.)

1570
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,400
Suk Jin, you get off first.

1571
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,400
Me first? Okay.

1572
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,950
(Suk Jin got off first by himself.)

1573
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,450
The potatoes the team earned...

1574
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,530
- are divided now.
- Okay.

1575
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:30,430
In the end, Team Se Chan lost.

1576
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:34,100
Team Haha got 13 potatoes
and the losing team got 10.

1577
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,240
It's a close game.

1578
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,200
I think we should have
a plot twist today.

1579
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,600
If you get there later,

1580
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,470
you'll carry out the final mission
using the potatoes.

1581
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,680
And you will get penalty stickers
through the mission.

1582
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,100
I guess the last game
is quite long as well.

1583
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,780
When you arrive there,
you will get off one by one...

1584
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,120
to choose a briefcase
with different numbers of potatoes.

1585
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,590
Are there real potatoes in it?

1586
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,280
The potatoes the team earned
are divided now.

1587
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,430
It has a different number
of potatoes. We don't know how many.

1588
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:04,260
You can choose randomly.

1589
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,700
- One out of these three?
- Yes.

1590
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,070
- I can't shake it, can I?
- No, you can't.

1591
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,240
(Pick 1 out of 3 randomly.)

1592
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,910
(He should pick the one with
13 potatoes to have an advantage.)

1593
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,030
(Team Se Chan's potatoes:
13, 10, 10)

1594
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:18,510
Check the inside.

1595
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,570
Should I?

1596
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,090
(Suk Jin was surprised
when he saw the inside.)

1597
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,410
- Should I leave it? Take it?
- You may take it.

1598
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,720
The potatoes the team earned
were divided.

1599
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,680
- They were?
- It's random.

1600
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,260
(Team Se Chan's potatoes:
13, 10, 10)

1601
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,430
Pick and check before you go.

1602
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:43,970
(Jae Suk checked it as well.)

1603
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,990
Yes, I checked it.

1604
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,780
(It's Se Chan's turn
and there's one briefcase left.)

1605
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,640
This isn't bad.

1606
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,700
Where should I go?

1607
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:59,050
(Who picked the one with 13 potatoes
among the members of Team Se Chan?)

1608
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,640
How many did you get?
They told us not to say it.

1609
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:03,510
I got 48.

1610
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:06,550
We got 30 in total.
How can you get over 40?

1611
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,450
- I'm just saying.
- I got nothing.

1612
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:11,550
I think one has much more potatoes
than the others. I got too little.

1613
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:12,660
How many did we get in total?

1614
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,470
- Was it 30-something?
- It was 33.

1615
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,160
I think one has much more potatoes
than the others. I got too little.

1616
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,760
- Right.
- This has almost nothing.

1617
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,340
(They start baiting each other.)

1618
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,070
- You got none of what?
- Potatoes.

1619
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:25,280
I also got a little.

1620
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,350
(While they're saying random things
to confuse others,)

1621
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:30,450
(Team Haha starts picking randomly
among 36 potatoes.)

1622
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:31,620
Oh, my goodness.

1623
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:36,180
(Team Haha's potatoes: 10, 10, 8, 8)

1624
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,680
Is this a lot?

1625
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,100
(Ji Hyo made her choice as well.)

1626
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,620
The penalty this time is...

1627
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,740
I hate that I should come out
that day rather than the penalty.

1628
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:50,890
- Me too.
- You should spare a day.

1629
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,430
- That's intense.
- That's what makes you crazy.

1630
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:53,700
- That's the biggest penalty.
- This penalty is intense.

1631
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,700
But...

1632
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,010
Aren't we getting the penalty
during the shoot?

1633
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,300
The ones who don't get
the penalty...

1634
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,640
won't have an extra shoot next week.

1635
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,700
(The ones who don't get
the penalty...)

1636
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,740
(won't have
an extra shoot next week.)

1637
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,620
(Only those who get the penalty
will have an extra shoot.)

1638
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,490
It's the last day
of the Chuseok holidays.

1639
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,010
- Only two people will shoot?
- Then the rest can enjoy...

1640
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:09,010
a longer break.

1641
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,160
That's right.

1642
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,660
We shouldn't get this.

1643
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,820
- We really shouldn't.
- It's the worst.

1644
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,660
Then only two members
will do the shoot?

1645
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,450
Gosh, that's crazy.

1646
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:18,930
- What do we do?
- I'll support you with two.

1647
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,490
What do we do?
Only two members will do the shoot.

1648
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,700
- I'm going to use the restroom.
- Only two members...

1649
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,430
Isn't it so cute
that he's taking it with him?

1650
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,840
Seeing how he's taking it with him,
it must have many potatoes.

1651
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,910
- He must have a lot.
- There must be a lot.

1652
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,140
He's taking the briefcase with him?

1653
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,970
- Why did he have to take it?
- We wouldn't bother to open it.

1654
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,910
Gosh, it's sad...

1655
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,010
that I had to take the briefcase
with me...

1656
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,850
- to the restroom.
- Why did you take it?

1657
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:42,850
- It's sad.
- There must be many potatoes.

1658
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,850
No, there isn't.

1659
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:45,760
- If not, he wouldn't have taken it.
- You wouldn't bother to take it.

1660
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,260
- Want to hear something funny?
- What is it?

1661
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,030
After you guys left one by one,

1662
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,530
Ji Hyo and I were the only ones
in the car.

1663
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,100
Then suddenly Ji Hyo called me.

1664
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,160
She said this while lying down.

1665
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,930
"Do you find me uncomfortable?"

1666
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,100
All of a sudden...

1667
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,300
(Do you find me uncomfortable?)

1668
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,740
We've known each other for 11 years.

1669
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,700
It wasn't like she came up
to me to ask it.

1670
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,320
She was just sprawling
on the seat and asked me.

1671
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,620
What do you suppose
she meant by this?

1672
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:14,680
(Only Haha and Ji Hyo
were left on the bus.)

1673
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,490
Do you find me uncomfortable?

1674
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:18,510
- What?
- Do you find me uncomfortable?

1675
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,090
You? Why would I?

1676
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,660
- Do you find me uncomfortable?
- No.

1677
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,100
Why did you ask that?

1678
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,260
It suddenly occurred to me.

1679
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,160
You're a nutjob.

1680
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,260
Why did you ask that?
Are you a nutjob?

1681
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,910
- I just asked out of nowhere.
- What was that about?

1682
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,100
- "Are you a nutjob?"
- But why?

1683
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,840
I was really scared.

1684
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,300
That's what made you
uncomfortable, right?

1685
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,600
So I asked her why.
Why did you ask me that?

1686
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,070
I just wanted to ask
all of a sudden.

1687
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,850
Were you possessed?

1688
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,220
Suk Jin.

1689
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,410
(Suk Jin.)

1690
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:47,820
I find you uncomfortable.

1691
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,320
They've been friends
for over 30 years.

1692
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
Hasn't it been over 30 years?

1693
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,760
- Yes, it's been 30 years.
- You still find him uncomfortable?

1694
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,120
- Yes, I do.
- I see.

1695
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,200
- It can't be helped, then.
- Here's the last mission.

1696
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,030
You must make good use
of the potatoes...

1697
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,820
so you wouldn't get
more penalty stickers.

1698
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,800
The mission is called
How to Make Use of Potatoes.

1699
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,570
Gosh, you can stop
with the dialect, Hyung In.

1700
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,910
- It's cute, Hyung In.
- It's cute.

1701
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:08,700
I can't stand it anymore.

1702
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,140
The number of potatoes
that each member has...

1703
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,300
won't be revealed.

1704
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,050
But we'll reveal the total number
of potatoes each team has.

1705
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,370
Team Haha acquired a total
of 36 potatoes.

1706
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,820
- What?
- They have 36 potatoes.

1707
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,550
Team Se Chan has 33 potatoes.

1708
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,550
- We're only three potatoes away.
- Thirty-three?

1709
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,160
Based on the total number
of potatoes,

1710
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,760
you can guess if the number
of potatoes in your briefcase...

1711
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,120
- is high or low.
- How many do we have in total?

1712
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,120
Thirty-six.

1713
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,660
In this mission,

1714
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,700
you'll submit as many potatoes
as you want individually.

1715
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,470
The team that submits
more potatoes wins.

1716
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:36,430
- We need to submit them?
- The fact that you are...

1717
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,570
- giving us such a mission...
- Come on.

1718
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,160
Let's stop with it already.

1719
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,930
The winning team
won't get any penalty stickers.

1720
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,200
The losing team will get
as many penalty stickers...

1721
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,300
- each round has.
- Let's submit them all.

1722
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,510
For the first round,
you'll get one sticker.

1723
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,550
For the 2nd and 3rd round,
you'll get 2 stickers each.

1724
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,550
You're not uncomfortable with me,
right?

1725
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:57,320
So we'll carry out three rounds
in the same way.

1726
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,720
The member with the least amount
of potatoes within the team...

1727
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,720
will take all the accumulated
penalty stickers of the team.

1728
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,030
- The penalty stickers?
- Yes.

1729
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,100
They'll be given to the member
with the least amount?

1730
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,800
Then we won't try to submit
our own potatoes.

1731
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,840
- Then no one will submit them.
- We'll avoid submitting them.

1732
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,490
But we won't get the stickers
if we win, right?

1733
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,010
- If you win, you won't get any.
- Let's just submit them all.

1734
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,200
- Promise me.
- Yes, let's all submit.

1735
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,680
- Of course.
- We win if we submit them all.

1736
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,070
We have 36 potatoes,
and they have 33.

1737
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,050
I'll have to get the penalty anyway.

1738
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,550
- Seriously. I'm getting it anyway.
- That's true.

1739
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,570
- Why?
- Yes, you must submit them all.

1740
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,850
I have four stickers,
so we must win.

1741
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,240
There's one thing
to consider, though.

1742
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,490
One of you will be confirmed
to get the penalty.

1743
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,220
One with the most number
of stickers.

1744
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,680
The one who has the least amount
will be exempted completely,

1745
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,550
like I announced earlier.

1746
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:37,850
For instance, if Jae Suk...

1747
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,620
tries hard not to earn any stickers,

1748
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,800
then he'll be exempted
even from the random choice.

1749
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,800
- He'll be exempted.
- He won't get it?

1750
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,990
So if he doesn't have
any stickers...

1751
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:49,160
But the odds are against me.

1752
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,910
It's hard to not get any stickers.

1753
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,600
It's whether you put yourself
or your team first.

1754
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,910
That's what the show
always makes us think.

1755
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,280
It's a dilemma. That's what you were
going to say, right?

1756
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,720
Now, you can discuss
for about ten minutes.

1757
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,450
Then you'll go one by one
to submit your potatoes.

1758
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,550
You can come up with strategies.

1759
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,490
Let's submit all of our potatoes
in all three rounds.

1760
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:09,930
- But...
- Let's submit everything.

1761
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,390
- And?
- Let's submit 11 in each round.

1762
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,530
(Seok Sam suggests submitting
11 potatoes in each round.)

1763
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,570
The 1st round
has 1 sticker at stake,

1764
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:15,600
and the remaining 2 rounds
have 2 stickers each, right?

1765
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,370
- So for the first round...
- Let's divide it into three.

1766
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:20,910
Let's just think of taking
the sticker from the first round.

1767
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:23,070
Then let's do this. Don't submit
any potatoes for the first round.

1768
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:24,280
For the second round...

1769
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,780
Let's not submit any potatoes
for the first round.

1770
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,100
They might come up
with the same plan.

1771
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,320
- Then...
- Should we just submit one each?

1772
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,550
They might not submit anything
in the first round.

1773
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,490
But if we just submit one,
and one of us doesn't submit any,

1774
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,490
we'll have a conflict.

1775
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:38,180
So let's just not submit any.

1776
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,180
You might have to take the sticker.

1777
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,180
Right.

1778
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,820
So for this mission...

1779
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:42,820
- I must submit them.
- You must submit them.

1780
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,030
- I must definitely submit them.
- You must submit them.

1781
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,490
There's no need to even discuss it.
We must submit them.

1782
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,160
- Otherwise, you'll be a fool.
- That's right.

1783
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,800
- You must think of winning.
- Of course.

1784
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,700
It's not like you're taking
the potatoes until the end.

1785
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,570
- They'll be used here only.
- That's exactly what I mean.

1786
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,840
- All right. Let's do it.
- Let's use them up.

1787
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,570
But what's that look in your eyes?

1788
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,300
So we won't submit any
for the first round.

1789
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,910
- Don't submit for the first one.
- Okay.

1790
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:03,570
The thing is, they might actually
not submit a lot.

1791
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,780
Then let's not submit any
for the first round.

1792
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,120
Let's just beat them
in the 2nd and 3rd rounds.

1793
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,120
I think we can still win if we
don't submit any in the first one.

1794
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,320
I know. Let's just gather
about five.

1795
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,820
- Or...
- One each?

1796
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,660
I'll submit two.
You guys submit one each.

1797
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,950
I'm serious.
Please trust me just this once.

1798
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,600
- I'll submit everything.
- You'll submit three?

1799
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,490
- I swear.
- Then I'll submit three.

1800
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:23,930
I'll bet my everything.

1801
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,530
Haha, don't you betray us.

1802
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,570
Hey, I have no place else to go.

1803
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,010
- Do you find me uncomfortable?
- I'm on the edge of a cliff.

1804
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,950
I don't find you uncomfortable!
Why would I?

1805
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,410
I've known you for 11 years.

1806
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,720
Just keep this in mind. Haha...

1807
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,120
has the highest chance
not to submit any...

1808
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,320
because he has the most number
of stickers.

1809
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,350
Don't be swayed by that.

1810
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,680
They have a higher chance
of not submitting any.

1811
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,120
Think about it. Jae Suk doesn't
even need to play for his team...

1812
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,680
because he doesn't have
any stickers.

1813
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,820
Even if his team loses,

1814
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,660
as long as he has many new
potatoes, he won't get any stickers.

1815
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,300
- What new potatoes?
- What do you mean?

1816
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,490
- New potatoes?
- Haha.

1817
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,930
- It's just potatoes.
- Potatoes.

1818
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:58,530
- Hey. Listen.
- What new potatoes?

1819
00:58:58,530 --> 00:58:59,800
Are you a new potato PR ambassador?

1820
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,200
- You saw how flustered I was, no?
- New potatoes?

1821
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,840
Was I flustered?
Do you find me uncomfortable?

1822
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,200
New potatoes.

1823
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,850
Not many people use that expression.

1824
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:08,470
But newly harvested potatoes
are good.

1825
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:09,570
Are you a farmer?

1826
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,220
- So let's just win the first round.
- Right.

1827
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,490
- Right, let's do that.
- Follow my hunch.

1828
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,010
- Let's do that.
- Let's go with my plan.

1829
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,680
- I'm really desperate here.
- Sounds good.

1830
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,090
Se Chan will go first.

1831
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,680
- Team Se Chan will go first.
- Go, Se Chan.

1832
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,390
Since we're submitting 1 each,
the total must be 3.

1833
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:25,620
- That's right.
- Right?

1834
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,890
- Guys.
- Okay. Let's go.

1835
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,200
- Brothers.
- Let's go.

1836
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,930
- Let's do this.
- I trust you as the youngest.

1837
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,390
- Se Chan. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1838
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:32,390
- Let's go! Go!
- Let's go!

1839
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,340
- Here come the new potatoes.
- Okay, go!

1840
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,410
- Hey, we...
- New potatoes?

1841
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,180
- Go!
- They're just regular potatoes.

1842
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,640
Guys, I'm going to submit
just as we discussed.

1843
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,600
- Of course.
- I have nothing to lose now.

1844
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,120
- Me too.
- Just follow our plan. Okay?

1845
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,120
Let's go.

1846
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,820
If the total number matches
the one we promised, I will cry...

1847
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,720
- because I'll be so touched.
- Don't worry.

1848
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,930
I have a question.
Let's say I submit one.

1849
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,180
Then the remaining potatoes
I have...

1850
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:56,700
will be minus
the ones I submitted, right?

1851
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,530
(Sighing)

1852
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,620
This is driving me crazy.

1853
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:06,410
I have no other options anyway.
This is driving me crazy.

1854
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:07,410
(They agreed to make the total 3
by submitting 1 each.)

1855
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:10,800
I'll submit one for now.

1856
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,340
We decided to forget about
the first round...

1857
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,800
and go all-in
in the 2nd and 3rd rounds.

1858
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,180
It can't be helped.
I'm submitting one...

1859
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,720
since we made a promise.

1860
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,010
(Se Chan kept his word
by submitting 1 potato.)

1861
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:24,590
(Next is Seok Sam.)

59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,269
I'm contemplating.

1862
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:29,120
The three of us made a firm promise.

1863
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,620
(Rambling on)

1864
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,470
(Suk Jin contemplated for a while.)

1865
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,200
(Will he submit one
just as he promised?)

1866
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,910
(He returns confidently.)

1867
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:41,760
Seok Sam, you're back.

1868
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:45,010
- Jae Suk, it's your turn.
- Okay.

1869
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,100
- You're on your way back, right?
- You're back.

1870
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,850
I am. Why do you look so down?

1871
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,950
You won't tell me
how many they submitted, right?

1872
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,070
(Obviously not.)

1873
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,510
(Contemplating)

1874
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,490
It looks like you didn't submit any.
Maybe I'm the only one who did.

1875
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,680
I don't think Jae Suk
will submit any either.

1876
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,260
Jae Suk won't submit any,

1877
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,260
but he'll just stand there
pretending to be contemplating.

1878
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:03,490
I'm certain of it.

1879
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,950
- He came back pretty fast.
- He's back so soon.

1880
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,820
You don't need to take much time.
Just do as you promised.

1881
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:08,930
- Right?
- Yes.

1882
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,160
(Jae Suk returned
faster than they thought.)

1883
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,430
You don't even have to contemplate.

1884
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,470
We'll submit
just like we discussed, right?

1885
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,530
- Team Haha, it's your turn.
- Okay.

1886
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,100
- Haha can go first.
- Okay.

1887
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,180
- I'll be back really fast.
- Come back as soon as you leave.

1888
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,200
Okay.

1889
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,300
(Haha promised to submit
2 potatoes alone.)

1890
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,510
I love you guys!

1891
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:23,910
Okay!

1892
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:25,010
That makes him suspicious.

1893
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,370
No, I think he'll submit
as he promised.

1894
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:29,010
Seeing how he went so far,
he'll submit them.

1895
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:30,680
(Haha has been going overboard.)

1896
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,120
(What will be his choice?)

1897
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,120
(He submitted 2 potatoes.)

1898
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,800
(Haha submitted 2 potatoes
just as he promised.)

1899
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:47,700
(When they were choosing
the briefcase,)

1900
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:52,280
(Haha chose one with 8 potatoes
out of 36.)

1901
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,820
(He was happy to choose a briefcase
with the least amount of potatoes.)

1902
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:02,450
(He gladly submitted
2 potatoes out of 8.)

1903
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:03,620
Next!

1904
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,450
- Wow! Should I go next?
- Jong Kook, you're next.

1905
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,680
Okay. I'll be back soon too.

1906
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,950
You don't even have to think much.

1907
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,620
- Did you really submit them?
- I did. I swear.

1908
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,660
But that wasn't enough time
to open and close the briefcase.

1909
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,200
But that wasn't enough time...

1910
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,640
(He came back this fast?)

1911
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,990
- No, I submitted them for real.
- You're such a good actor.

1912
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:21,100
But that was almost like...

1913
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,640
- You came back so fast?
- So Min, you'll be the only one.

1914
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:28,280
Just as I promised. All right.
I'll submit one.

1915
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:34,450
(He doesn't even think twice
and submits 1 just as he promised.)

1916
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,820
- I swear. He came back fast too.
- Ji Hyo, you're next.

1917
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,450
- I swear I submitted them.
- No.

1918
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:40,950
- I swear.
- It looks like you didn't even...

1919
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:42,090
put down the briefcase.

1920
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,800
So Min, don't be embarrassed later
when you watch this episode.

1921
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,450
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1922
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:47,930
Let's play rock-paper-scissors,
and the loser...

1923
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,160
How can they come back so fast?

1924
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,200
(Ji Hyo comes out all suspicious.)

1925
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,430
Maybe they didn't submit any.

1926
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,030
(Ji Hyo and So Min
are done submitting as well.)

1927
01:02:58,030 --> 01:02:59,100
Okay.

1928
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:00,780
Are you done?

1929
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,140
- I think they are done.
- They are done.

1930
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,780
(Submission is complete
for Round 1.)

1931
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,740
- Let's see.
- Yes.

1932
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,350
- The result of Round One is out.
- Okay.

1933
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,620
- A penalty sticker is on the line.
- That's right.

1934
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,760
Team Haha submitted...

1935
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:15,930
a total...

1936
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:20,890
(The total number of potatoes
Team Haha submitted)

1937
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,200
I will submit 2, so submit 1 each.

1938
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,010
(Team Haha agreed to submit
a total of 5 potatoes.)

1939
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,600
Team Haha submitted a total...

1940
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:32,340
- of two potatoes.
- Hey.

1941
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,370
- Hey.
- This is too much.

1942
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:35,850
- A total of two potatoes.
- Hey.

1943
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:37,720
- Hey.
- This is too much.

1944
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,680
- You punk.
- Whose fault is this?

1945
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:41,410
- You promised to submit potatoes.
- They are fighting.

1946
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:42,490
- Haha.
- Hey.

1947
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,090
- I submitted potatoes.
- Haha.

1948
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,660
- You promised to submit potatoes.
- For goodness' sake.

1949
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,760
- Haha.
- This lousy team...

1950
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,430
- Why didn't you keep your word?
- I got fooled.

1951
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,300
- We decided to submit one each.
- I knew this would happen.

1952
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,350
- We won.
- We submitted one each.

1953
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,530
Did you submit potatoes
as you promised or not?

1954
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,800
(A physical fight is
about to break out.)

1955
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,200
- Only I submitted potatoes.
- We won.

1956
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,530
- Only I submitted potatoes.
- Listen.

1957
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,930
Had you submitted potatoes
as you promised,

1958
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:01,840
- I will give you my entire fortune.
- Okay.

1959
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,870
- I will give you my entire fortune.
- Make sure you do that.

1960
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:05,530
- I can't believe it.
- It's a promise.

1961
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,870
You didn't submit a potato.

1962
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,550
Didn't you submit a potato,
Jong Kook?

1963
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,620
- I will give you my entire fortune.
- Haha, you are the one...

1964
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,680
who didn't submit any potatoes.

1965
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,820
Hey,

1966
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:16,220
- I will bet my entire family.
- Then the number should be greater.

1967
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,350
(Will he bet his family?)

1968
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:18,820
- Will he bet his family?
- Jong Kook.

1969
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:20,660
- Haha.
- I submitted potatoes.

1970
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:21,890
- Hold on.
- Haha.

1971
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:23,550
Doesn't that mean
the count is wrong?

1972
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:24,700
- Well...
- Is the total two?

1973
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,300
- No way.
- It can't be two.

1974
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,490
Count again.

1975
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,260
- It makes no sense.
- Seriously.

1976
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,640
I bet my entire fortune,
and he bet his family.

1977
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:32,840
I bet my family.

1978
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,070
It makes no sense.

1979
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,640
- Count again.
- I bet my entire fortune,

1980
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,530
- and he bet his family.
- I swear I submitted potatoes.

1981
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:38,780
- We are checking.
- Check.

1982
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:40,450
- Check. I misunderstood then.
- Check.

1983
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:42,450
- We bet our fortune and family.
- I am sorry.

1984
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,550
- I can bet my entire fortune too.
- Hold on.

1985
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,510
Isn't it that team's total?
I think that team submitted two.

1986
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,640
- We should have at least...
- Outside,

1987
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,910
- the staff counted wrong.
- I knew it.

1988
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:51,160
- Hey.
- I can't believe you counted wrong.

1989
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,950
- I am sorry, Haha. I love you.
- It's okay.

1990
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,620
You get it now, right?

1991
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,930
Yes.

1992
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,120
Okay. I am sorry.

1993
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,300
- I submitted potatoes for real.
- We bet our fortune and family.

1994
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,490
I bet my family.

1995
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:01,990
- We bet our fortune and family.
- I was startled.

1996
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:03,160
(What's the real total
for Team Haha?)

1997
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,100
How could you count wrong
when there were only two potatoes?

1998
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,070
- All right.
- Team Haha's total is four.

1999
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,160
- That makes more sense.
- Come on, So Min.

2000
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,180
Team Haha's total is four.

2001
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,680
- That makes more sense.
- Come on, So Min.

2002
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,970
So Min didn't submit any.

2003
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:14,570
- It isn't me. I did submit one.
- She betrayed us.

2004
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:16,950
- I really submitted one.
- So Min didn't submit any.

2005
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,280
- She didn't submit any.
- No.

2006
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,120
- She didn't submit any.
- I really submitted one.

2007
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,820
- What will you bet?
- Me? I will bet my mom and dad.

2008
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:25,160
- I will bet my mom and dad.
- Ji Hyo, bet your dog.

2009
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,890
(So Min acts like
she is victimized.)

2010
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,530
- Let me see your fingers.
- It's Ji Hyo. Look at her face.

2011
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,350
- Ji Hyo didn't submit any.
- I can bet my entire fortune.

2012
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,300
- Maybe the count is wrong again.
- Let me see your fingers.

2013
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,600
- I can bet my entire fortune.
- Your toes must be crossed.

2014
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,640
(Either JI Hyo or So Min is lying.)

2015
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,370
- You...
- My toes aren't crossed.

2016
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:41,140
- That would be impossible.
- Maybe you counted wrong again.

2017
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,160
Are you certain?

2018
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,470
- Now comes Team Se Chan's total.
- Our team.

2019
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:45,640
- Our team.
- Let's see.

2020
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,700
- We submitted two each.
- Team Se Chan submitted a total...

2021
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,740
of one potato.

2022
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,240
- What?
- Excuse me?

2023
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,820
A total of one potato.

2024
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,220
- What?
- Excuse me?

2025
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,320
- What?
- Hey.

2026
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,910
(They fail to stifle
their laughter.)

2027
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,090
Who is it?

2028
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,350
- We won.
- I can't believe you guys.

2029
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,030
- Hey.
- Seriously.

2030
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:02,430
- Come here.
- Is it really one?

2031
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:03,550
- Hey.
- Hey.

2032
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:06,700
I think I should submit one potato.

2033
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:09,490
I will bring more potatoes
in the following rounds.

2034
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,570
(No more potatoes were submitted.)

2035
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:12,970
- Come here.
- Come here.

2036
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,200
- One?
- One?

2037
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,370
- Don't be like that.
- One?

2038
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:16,640
- Hey. One?
- One?

2039
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,640
- For goodness' sake.
- One?

2040
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,200
- I can't believe them.
- One?

2041
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,300
- Hey.
- You should have submitted one.

2042
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,370
- Hey.
- Hey.

2043
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:25,550
- Seriously.
- Don't you trust us?

2044
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:26,550
For goodness' sake.

2045
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,740
I trusted you guys. Listen.

2046
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:29,890
Suk Jin, I...

2047
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:31,410
- Hey.
- We talked about this.

2048
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:32,720
You shouldn't be like that.

2049
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,390
- Only I submitted a potato.
- Are you certain?

2050
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:36,530
- Team Se Chan lost...
- Can you bet your wife?

2051
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:38,300
and acquired one penalty sticker.

2052
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,200
Round Two will begin now.

2053
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,200
Please discuss among yourselves
for ten minutes.

2054
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,530
I won't submit any potatoes then.

2055
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:46,030
Two penalty stickers are on the line
for the next round.

2056
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:47,340
This many potatoes...

2057
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,470
are more than enough
to surpass that team.

2058
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:51,470
- We used too many potatoes.
- We used too many of them.

2059
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:52,930
- I told you so.
- I told you so.

2060
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:55,240
Now, we can't ask people
to submit potatoes. Think about it.

2061
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,510
We have to play individually.

2062
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:58,070
We need to submit potatoes now.
Come here.

2063
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,320
Come here, Se Chan.

2064
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,050
- I won't submit any.
- Suk Jin, come here.

2065
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,280
I won't submit any.

2066
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,260
- I won't submit any.
- Listen.

2067
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,350
- We need to win in the next rounds.
- I won't submit any.

2068
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:07,430
We have to submit potatoes now.

2069
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:08,930
- We have to do it.
- We have to do it.

2070
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:10,820
Listen to me.

2071
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:11,930
You know that I submitted
a potato, right?

2072
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,570
You didn't submit any potatoes.

2073
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,030
- It's true. Come on.
- I submitted a potato.

2074
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,570
- It's time to tell the truth.
- Suk Jin.

2075
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,600
- It's time to tell the truth.
- You should be honest.

2076
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,760
Let's have a cheer.

2077
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,640
(Let's have a cheer.)

2078
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,760
(He suddenly suggests a cheer.)

2079
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,840
- Let's have a cheer.
- Let's do that.

2080
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,370
Se Chan, let's have a cheer.

2081
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:26,910
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2082
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,070
- Let's go.
- Good.

2083
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:29,870
- This is the beginning.
- What was that?

2084
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:31,320
- Let's start anew.
- To be honest, I didn't submit any.

2085
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,470
- You didn't either.
- I didn't submit any.

2086
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:33,950
You submitted a potato.

2087
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,350
- Se Chan, let's start anew.
- You submitted a potato.

2088
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:36,820
- I submitted a potato.
- Let's go.

2089
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:39,350
Let me tell you this.
If you don't submit potatoes...

2090
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:41,550
in the next rounds,

2091
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,930
- we will lose.
- It will be game over.

2092
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,720
We will lose.

2093
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,320
We will get
all five penalty stickers.

2094
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,490
- We can't let that happen.
- No.

2095
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:49,990
We can't let that happen.

2096
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,840
Tell us later
why you didn't submit any.

2097
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,140
I submitted a potato.

2098
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,530
- Tell us later.
- I submitted a potato.

2099
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:57,070
- You are embarrassed, right?
- I submitted a potato.

2100
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,700
- You can bet your mom and dad.
- Yes.

2101
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,010
(Yes.)

2102
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,740
What will you say to your mom later?

2103
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,910
- Why are you teary-eyed?
- Will you live separately?

2104
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:07,450
You feel bad, right?
Apologize to your mom and dad.

2105
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:10,350
(When it was her turn
to submit potatoes,)

2106
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:11,660
(she only pretended
to open the briefcase.)

2107
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:14,660
(Only So Min didn't submit
any potatoes.)

2108
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,760
You feel bad, right?
Apologize to your mom and dad.

2109
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,800
- Apologize to your mom and dad.
- Apologize to them.

2110
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,990
Go to the Jimmy Jib
or your camera and apologize.

2111
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:24,800
- We forgive you. Go and apologize.
- Do it.

2112
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,600
I did submit a potato.

2113
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,760
Did everyone keep the promise?

2114
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,340
- She didn't.
- I did.

2115
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,010
- I totally did.
- You did, right?

2116
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:34,200
Only So Min didn't.

2117
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,200
So Min, what are you going to do?

2118
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,220
This is why we treat her this way.

2119
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,240
You belong to our team.

2120
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,520
Seriously.

2121
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,650
Listen.

2122
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:45,190
Although we didn't keep the promise,

2123
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:46,690
we just made up.

2124
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:49,120
- We just laughed it off.
- We just laughed it off.

2125
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:51,450
It's nothing big.
We just laughed it off.

2126
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:53,730
- I mean...
- Come on out and apologize.

2127
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,360
They keep telling me to bet things.

2128
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,620
Who does that?

2129
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,530
Hurry up and tell them to stop.

2130
01:08:58,530 --> 01:08:59,800
- Apologize to them.
- Seriously.

2131
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,770
- My mom and dad would understand.
- This is a variety show.

2132
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:05,440
"My mom and dad would understand."

2133
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,070
(They demand collateral
over a potato.)

2134
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,150
Let's submit three each.
I don't think they will submit many.

2135
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,940
If Jong Kook submits 3,
their total will be 6.

2136
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,480
Because that team has Jong Kook...

2137
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:14,850
If we submit three each,

2138
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,890
- we will win.
- Really?

2139
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:17,590
Okay. I will listen to you.

2140
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:19,480
- Then we will go all in.
- Nine potatoes.

2141
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:21,390
We need to win the next round.

2142
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,730
Potatoes will be meaningless
if we lose.

2143
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:23,900
- We need to win the next round.
- I do want to win, but...

2144
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:26,430
If we submit four each,

2145
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:27,930
- it won't be a problem.
- Okay.

2146
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:28,970
- Four each.
- Four each.

2147
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:29,970
- Okay.
- This time, submit potatoes.

2148
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:31,190
- Please.
- Okay.

2149
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:32,360
- Let's win.
- I can't believe them.

2150
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,940
- We will submit potatoes.
- They are looking at me like cats.

2151
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,400
- We will submit potatoes this time.
- Of course.

2152
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,440
I am sorry, but what's the point...

2153
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,610
of having a meeting?

2154
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,010
We are tight.

2155
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,700
- It's our strategy.
- We are tight.

2156
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,180
- Only a fool would submit potatoes.
- Why?

2157
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,910
- Why are you having a meeting?
- Only a fool would submit potatoes.

2158
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:47,550
- Why?
- Only a fool would submit potatoes.

2159
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,780
- Why would you say that?
- We will win.

2160
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:50,760
- Why would you submit potatoes?
- We will win two rounds.

2161
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,480
- What are you saying?
- Jae Suk wouldn't submit any.

2162
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,280
- Of course he would. We must win.
- Of course I would.

2163
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,120
- What are you saying?
- Submit potatoes no matter what.

2164
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,490
(The cats are pretty determined.)

2165
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:58,560
Hear me out.

2166
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,400
I have a strategy.

2167
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,430
This time,

2168
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,360
let's not submit any potatoes.

2169
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,970
- We won a round.
- Yes.

2170
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,140
- Let's go all in for Round Three.
- Let's do that.

2171
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,640
- That's a good idea.
- Yes.

2172
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,940
We should do that.

2173
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,240
- We can win then.
- We should do that.

2174
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,510
- Let's do that.
- I believe in you guys.

2175
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,050
I think they will submit potatoes.

2176
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,550
I think so.

2177
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:21,440
We will focus on the last round.

2178
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,410
I hope that team submits
a lot of potatoes in this round.

2179
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,780
Two rounds remain,

2180
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,860
- so we have to win.
- Okay.

2181
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,320
- In the next round,
- That's right.

2182
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,760
- they might not submit potatoes.
- Let's go.

2183
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,020
Let's go.

2184
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,620
- Let's go.
- Let's bring our hands together.

2185
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,060
I can't believe them.

2186
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,320
- Come here.
- Jae Suk.

2187
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,100
- We aren't fools.
- Hey.

2188
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:38,840
We got this.

2189
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,860
One, two, three.

2190
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,010
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2191
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:42,010
(Cheers for the team.)

2192
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:45,070
- Jae Suk.
- Jong Kook, please go first.

2193
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,140
Okay.

2194
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,770
- Haha.
- Okay.

2195
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:50,180
- This is our strategy.
- Okay.

2196
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,240
I got it.

2197
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,870
(Team Haha agreed
to submit 0 potatoes.)

2198
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:58,110
(What kind of a result
will their strategy bring?)

2199
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:00,930
(The first member, Jong Kook)

2200
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:05,230
(He submits 0 potatoes.)

2201
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:06,450
(Team Haha finishes submitting.)

2202
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:07,560
All right.

2203
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:08,970
- I am stressed out.
- Yes.

2204
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:10,660
- Seriously.
- That was simple.

2205
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,800
Of course. I changed a lot.

2206
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:14,610
- Suk Jin, you are up.
- Okay.

2207
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,770
- Hey.
- How many potatoes?

2208
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,340
- Is this enough?
- Yes.

2209
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,310
(Team Se Chan's plan
is to submit 9 potatoes.)

2210
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:23,720
My conscience and rationality...

2211
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,070
keep fighting.

2212
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,020
(The match of the century,
conscience versus rationality)

2213
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,550
Rationally,
I know exactly how to win.

2214
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:31,560
But my conscience...

2215
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,720
(Suk Jin has
a fierce inner battle.)

2216
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,730
But...

2217
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,230
What should I do?

2218
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:38,730
(Should he submit 3 potatoes
as he promised or not?)

2219
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,820
My conscience and rationality
keep fighting.

2220
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,600
I should submit some potatoes.

2221
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,190
We might win.

2222
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,360
In any case...

2223
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,840
(Suk Jin makes up his mind
after much deliberation.)

2224
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,440
I am torn.

2225
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:56,740
We do need to win.

2226
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,810
I think Se Chan is submitting
one potato at a time...

2227
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:01,350
because he has a lot of potatoes.

2228
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:07,280
There is no way
Suk Jin submitted three potatoes.

2229
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,820
(He thinks Suk Jin doesn't have
many potatoes.)

2230
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:10,450
(Briefcase selection)

2231
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:12,260
(Team Se Chan's potatoes:
10, 10, 13)

2232
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:14,100
(Jae Suk received 10 potatoes.)

2233
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,160
I checked.

2234
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:20,840
(That means either one of them
received 13 potatoes.)

2235
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:29,810
(Se Chan is the last one to go.)

2236
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:38,910
(How many potatoes
did Se Chan submit?)

2237
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:41,060
He came back quickly.

2238
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:44,560
- Let's see.
- Round Two has ended.

2239
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:45,800
I will reveal...

2240
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,190
- Team Se Chan's total first.
- I bet the number is high.

2241
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:50,190
- What should the total number be?
- Nine.

2242
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:51,270
- What should it be?
- Nine.

2243
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,270
- Nine.
- Yes.

2244
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:54,310
Team Se Chan submitted a total...

2245
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,560
of one potato.

2246
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,680
For goodness' sake.

2247
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,640
(Team Se Chan's total is
one potato.)

2248
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,240
- They are too much.
- Hey.

2249
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,510
- One potato.
- For goodness' sake.

2250
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:05,740
(The number is much lower
than they expected.)

2251
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,150
This is too much.

2252
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,020
- I can't believe them.
- Hey.

2253
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,760
I can't believe them.

2254
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,780
(Who submitted 1 potato?)

2255
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:18,620
(He took back all potatoes.)

2256
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,640
(Se Chan put on a show
and locked up his briefcase!)

2257
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,900
(Jae Suk thought there was someone
with more potatoes.)

2258
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,030
My conscience and rationality
keep fighting.

2259
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,940
(Suk Jin's conscience
and rationality had a big match.)

2260
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:35,180
One potato.

2261
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:38,350
I should submit some potatoes.
We might win.

2262
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,570
(Thus, he submitted one potato
for his conscience.)

2263
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:42,550
- I can't believe them.
- Hey.

2264
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,220
(The team spirit is in the gutter.)

2265
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,020
- Come here.
- For goodness' sake.

2266
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:48,150
- They are too much.
- For goodness' sake.

2267
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,390
- One?
- Hey.

2268
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,450
- What's wrong with you guys?
- Hey.

2269
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,360
- Didn't you submit any?
- Didn't you submit any?

2270
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,520
- Didn't you submit any?
- You should have submitted three.

2271
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,660
- Didn't you submit any?
- I submitted one potato.

2272
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,160
- I submitted one potato.
- I did that.

2273
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,470
- I submitted one potato.
- For goodness' sake.

2274
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:01,340
- Didn't you submit any potatoes?
- Unbelievable.

2275
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:02,940
- And...
- All right.

2276
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:07,070
Team Haha submitted
a total of zero potatoes.

2277
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:08,550
- We won.
- We won.

2278
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,370
Team Haha submitted
a total of zero potatoes.

2279
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:14,650
(Did they win with 1 potato?)

2280
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:15,940
- We won.
- We won.

2281
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,280
(The miracle of one potato)

2282
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:21,120
We won with one potato.

2283
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,120
We did it.

2284
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,490
We did it.

2285
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,300
Someone submitted one potato.

2286
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,660
(Team Se Chan won
with fewer potatoes than expected.)

2287
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:28,730
Someone submitted one potato.

2288
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,690
I wonder who submitted one potato.

2289
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:32,800
- Who did it?
- I am sure Se Chan did.

2290
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,160
Do I have a lot of potatoes?

2291
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,160
(Briefcase selection)

2292
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,230
I have ten.

2293
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:39,730
What's the highest number
of potatoes?

2294
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:43,270
- Jong Kook doesn't have a lot.
- It seems that way.

2295
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:46,410
(Team Haha's potatoes: 8, 8, 10, 10)

2296
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:48,110
(10 potatoes)

2297
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:49,550
I have eight.

2298
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,590
(8 potatoes)

2299
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:53,720
Please discuss among yourselves
for the last round.

2300
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,450
- Someone submitted a potato.
- We won.

2301
01:14:56,450 --> 01:15:01,400
(At this rate, Haha will receive
a penalty sticker.)

2302
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,730
- I submitted a potato.
- We did it.

2303
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:06,230
- You didn't submit any.
- We still won.

2304
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,110
Good.

2305
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,360
We have a chance.
They submitted zero potatoes.

2306
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,810
- I submitted a potato.
- Please discuss among yourselves...

2307
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:12,810
for the last round.

2308
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,510
- They don't have potatoes to spare.
- Suk Jin.

2309
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,310
I can't believe we won.

2310
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:18,020
- Someone submitted a potato.
- I think...

2311
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,720
we should submit two potatoes each.

2312
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,050
Sit down.

2313
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,150
(One had 13 potatoes
and the other had 10 potatoes.)

2314
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:25,590
You should think about winning,
not keeping your potatoes.

2315
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:26,890
You won thanks to me.

2316
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:29,060
You submitted 1 potato
when we agreed on 3.

2317
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:31,100
I knew you would submit
zero potatoes.

2318
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,100
You have a point.

2319
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,190
You have a lot of potatoes, right?

2320
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,340
- I don't have many left.
- Be honest.

2321
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:39,640
- Why don't you have many left?
- I have less than ten.

2322
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,140
- Don't lie.
- I have less than ten.

2323
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:43,470
- I looked into it.
- Really?

2324
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:45,200
Someone took 13 potatoes.

2325
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,180
The others took ten potatoes each.

2326
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:48,270
(Did Se Chan take 13 potatoes?)

2327
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:49,350
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

2328
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:50,850
Do you have ten potatoes now?

2329
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,350
Tell me what the strategy is.

2330
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,410
Submit two potatoes this time.

2331
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,810
Why?

2332
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,280
You and I should submit one each.

2333
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,860
Ten potatoes each.

2334
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:01,950
We need to submit
as many potatoes as possible.

2335
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:04,730
We have different numbers
of potatoes.

2336
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,360
- Leave some potatoes and...
- Submit all but two potatoes.

2337
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,940
(Laughing)

2338
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:16,360
We had this talk earlier,
but only one potato was submitted.

2339
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,530
Didn't we have
the same type of discussion earlier?

2340
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,550
But we didn't get
more than one potato.

2341
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:25,370
This is ridiculous.

2342
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,440
It's a bit funny.

2343
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,810
Let's submit potatoes this time.

2344
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:31,650
I will submit potatoes
since receiving a penalty sticker...

2345
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,360
- is meaningless.
- Let's all submit potatoes.

2346
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,360
(The three cats have
the same type of discussion.)

2347
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,390
What should we do now?

2348
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:39,260
Here is what I think, Jong Kook.

2349
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:44,970
This time, I think that team
will either submit zero potatoes...

2350
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:48,270
- or one potato.
- Right.

2351
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:53,680
A member who received many potatoes
should submit one.

2352
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,740
(Jong Kook suggests
submitting one potato.)

2353
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:56,900
- Okay.
- Okay?

2354
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,310
- In that case...
- It goes without saying.

2355
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,440
Instead of submitting one potato,

2356
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:01,910
let's do this.

2357
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:03,590
I see.

2358
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,260
I would be grateful if you do that.

2359
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:07,310
- Submit two potatoes? Okay.
- Yes.

2360
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,450
She must have many potatoes.

2361
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,650
I only have a few.

2362
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:11,600
I will do it for the team.

2363
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,060
That team will try to keep
their potatoes.

2364
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,930
- So Ji Hyo will submit this many.
- Yes.

2365
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,440
- Thank you. You are so cool.
- I will do it for the team.

2366
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,440
Ji Hyo is... My goodness.

2367
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,470
Ji Hyo.

2368
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,860
You are insanely cool.

2369
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,230
Although I only have a few potatoes,

2370
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:27,180
- I will do it for the team.
- Then I will submit a potato too.

2371
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:28,400
We should win this round.

2372
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:29,980
Can you submit one potato?

2373
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:30,980
(So Min, can you submit one potato?)

2374
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,850
Do it to restore our faith in you.

2375
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,480
- Okay.
- Promise us.

2376
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,520
- Okay. I will really do it.
- For real.

2377
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,280
Then you will submit this many,
and Ji Hyo will submit this many.

2378
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,720
- All right.
- How about you?

2379
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,650
I submitted potatoes earlier.

2380
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:44,430
That's right.
This balances things out.

2381
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,400
- Team Se Chan's Jae Suk is up.
- Okay.

2382
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,930
- Decide before you go.
- Decide before you go.

2383
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:51,340
- Listen to me.
- Then Jae Suk should take it.

2384
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,860
Submit all but one.

2385
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:54,770
- Okay, I got it.
- Got it? Really?

2386
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,140
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2387
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:59,570
- You know,
- We will go all in.

2388
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:00,680
here is what I think.

2389
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,510
The team that submits
three potatoes will win.

2390
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:04,150
(He gives up.)

2391
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:05,980
Three potatoes.

2392
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:07,740
Suit yourself.

2393
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,110
I think the number is less
than that.

2394
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:10,280
We will go all in.

2395
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,390
The team that submits
one potato will win.

2396
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:15,430
(Jae Suk could be exempt
from the penalty...)

2397
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:18,430
(since he has 0 penalty stickers.)

2398
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:19,600
(Jae Suk)

2399
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:25,270
(Will he go all in for the team
or submit 0 potatoes for himself?)

2400
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:28,470
We agreed to submit 3 each
and I submitted 1 in a naive way.

2401
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:31,110
Suk Jin is up next.

2402
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,140
- Submit all but one.
- As for Suk Jin...

2403
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:37,010
Why did you make a fist?

2404
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,070
(Laughing)

2405
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:39,910
(Chuckling)

2406
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:42,550
After having a lengthy discussion,

2407
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,520
we will have one potato.

2408
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,190
I am so impressed
that no one became sullen.

2409
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:48,150
- No one became sullen.
- We understand each other.

2410
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:49,520
We understand each other.

2411
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,590
We let things go.

2412
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:52,860
- We let things go.
- "I am sure he had his reasons."

2413
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:55,360
- It happens on a show.
- "I am sure he had his reasons."

2414
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:56,600
(Again, he must choose
between conscience and rationality.)

2415
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,940
Since I submitted a potato earlier,
they won't submit any.

2416
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,730
I don't even feel
a prick of conscience anymore.

2417
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:05,030
We won the last round thanks to me.
I did more than enough.

2418
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:06,610
All right.

2419
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:08,810
(How many potatoes
did Suk Jin submit?)

2420
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,980
Had So Min joined this team...

2421
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,020
(Suk Jin returns with seriousness.)

2422
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,280
Suk Jin, let me see your eyes.

2423
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,240
Let me see the truth in your eyes.

2424
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,390
How many did you submit?

2425
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,450
(Eye contact of the truth)

2426
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:23,520
- Okay.
- Did you submit potatoes?

2427
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,860
- Of course.
- Just submit all of them.

2428
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,430
My briefcase is empty.

2429
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:29,100
- You can't boil them at home.
- They will be a burden.

2430
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,560
(Rolling)

2431
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:35,200
Why did you do that?

2432
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,560
Hey.

2433
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,200
You said you submitted all.
Why are potatoes rolling around?

2434
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,150
(The sound of guilty conscience)

2435
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,150
Seriously.

2436
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:44,740
Seriously.

2437
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:48,720
You said you submitted all.
Why are potatoes rolling around?

2438
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,890
(The man with guilty conscience
collects potatoes.)

2439
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,410
It's hot in here.

2440
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:55,060
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

2441
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:58,300
The 1st and 2nd rounds
left me with many scars.

2442
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:02,190
(Team Se Chan finishes
submitting potatoes.)

2443
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:03,800
So Min, please go first.

2444
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,970
Hey.

2445
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:06,560
So Min, don't get swayed.

2446
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:07,860
- Okay.
- Follow the strategy.

2447
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,510
- I will do that.
- Do what you promised...

2448
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:10,700
- and we will win.
- Okay.

2449
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:13,340
(All members of Team Haha
finish submitting potatoes.)

2450
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,940
There is someone
who has more potatoes, right?

2451
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,940
- If we are lucky,
- I am sure everyone was torn.

2452
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,310
- we will win again.
- We could take a win.

2453
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:21,390
With how many potatoes?

2454
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,590
With how many potatoes will we win?

2455
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:24,950
Tasty potatoes.

2456
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:27,110
(He gives a strange answer.)

2457
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:29,150
You should give me a number.

2458
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:31,100
You are good at mathematics.

2459
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,650
- It will be a tasty win.
- Tasty?

2460
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:34,230
Yes. It will be a tasty win.

2461
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:36,100
You finished submitting potatoes.

2462
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,970
- Okay. It's time.
- It's time. Let's go.

2463
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:41,340
I will reveal the totals
for Round Three.

2464
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:44,770
- In this round, Team Haha...
- Okay.

2465
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:46,480
- submitted a total of...
- There should be four.

2466
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,070
Did they submit four?

2467
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,980
Four potatoes.

2468
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,910
So Min submitted a potato.

2469
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:55,810
(Ji Hyo submitted 2,
So Min and Jong Kook submitted 1.)

2470
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:57,150
- So Min submitted a potato.
- So Min submitted a potato.

2471
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:59,560
- I didn't think she would.
- Did you submit one each?

2472
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:02,590
- Team Se Chan submitted...
- I told you to submit one.

2473
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:05,120
- Team Se Chan submitted...
- Okay.

2474
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,730
a total...

2475
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:07,970
(They agreed to submit all
except for 1 potato.)

2476
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:09,470
- A total...
- I bet we won.

2477
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:10,930
A total...

2478
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,690
of zero potatoes.

2479
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:14,660
(A total of 0 potatoes)

2480
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:17,730
Team Se Chan lost
and acquired two penalty stickers.

2481
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:19,340
- I knew it.
- Three and two.

2482
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:22,050
You played all three rounds.

2483
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:24,200
Team Haha got
two penalty stickers...

2484
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,350
and Team Se Chan got
three penalty stickers.

2485
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:27,370
Three? We have two.

2486
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:28,410
(Which members will get
the stickers?)

2487
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:30,480
Jae Suk should take some stickers.

2488
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,780
Jae Suk won't get a penalty.

2489
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:35,280
Team Haha, check
the remaining number of potatoes.

2490
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,950
The one with the fewest potatoes
will take two stickers.

2491
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,120
- Is it me?
- Let's count.

2492
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,470
I have eight potatoes.

2493
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,560
I have six potatoes.

2494
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,300
I have nine potatoes.

2495
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,360
I have five potatoes.

2496
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,010
I have five potatoes.

2497
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:49,510
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo has the fewest.

2498
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:52,010
- Ji Hyo.
- You had ten potatoes too.

2499
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,370
(Ji Hyo)

2500
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,570
- You know,
- You are cool.

2501
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:56,370
Ji Hyo did all the work.

2502
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,980
Team Se Chan has
three penalty stickers.

2503
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,150
Three, right?

2504
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,780
- Suk Jin...
- Jae Suk.

2505
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,240
I have ten potatoes.

2506
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:06,520
Two, four, six...

2507
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,610
I have ten potatoes.

2508
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:10,120
(How many potatoes
does Suk Jin have?)

2509
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,450
- All right.
- You got quite a lot.

2510
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,730
- I bet he does.
- He had a lot.

2511
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,470
Gosh, I can't believe this.

2512
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:18,990
(Either Se Chan or Suk Jin
will receive the penalty.)

2513
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:39,020
(How many potatoes
does Suk Jin have?)

2514
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,520
It's him who took 13 potatoes.

2515
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:42,330
I have 12.

2516
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,470
Two, four, six, eight, and ten.

2517
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,810
- It's him who took 13 potatoes.
- Two, four, six, eight, and ten.

2518
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,230
He got nine.

2519
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,510
- How many?
- I have nine.

2520
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:51,570
(Se Chan 9, Jae Suk 10,
Suk Jin 12)

2521
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:53,200
- That was so close.
- Gosh, Jae Suk.

2522
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,870
He has zero stickers.

2523
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,520
- My goodness.
- This is unbelievable.

2524
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,550
He didn't get any stickers.

2525
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:00,280
So the four-week-long
penalty race is over.

2526
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,860
Will Se Chan get the penalty?

2527
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:05,690
Yang Se Chan got seven stickers,
so he will get the penalty.

2528
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:07,320
Oh, no. Se Chan.

2529
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:10,230
- And?
- Jae Suk with no sticker...

2530
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:12,320
- is exempted from the penalty.
- This is ridiculous.

2531
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,690
- Darn it.
- I can't believe this.

2532
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:14,770
How is this possible?

2533
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:16,100
So he's exempted?

2534
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,490
- We're in trouble.
- I should've picked 13 potatoes.

2535
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:19,070
We should've given him
one sticker last week.

2536
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:22,200
Who will watch Running Man?
He should get the penalty.

2537
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,310
We will decide the penalty and
the member to get it next week.

2538
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:27,680
I will announce
the proposed penalties then.

2539
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,980
What matters is
what the proposed penalties are.

2540
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,740
So Jae Suk is exempted
from the penalty, right?

2541
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,020
I'm exempted.

2542
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:36,280
(Panning for gold
at a stream in Gangwon)

2543
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:39,890
(Riding a sky-glider in the sky)

2544
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:44,020
(Upgraded water jump)

2545
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:49,300
(A bike that runs in the sky)

2546
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:55,570
(The final list will be complete
with the viewers' opinions.)

2547
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:57,110
(We will wait for your opinions
about the penalty.)

2548
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:59,870
Please open number one first.

2549
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:00,980
Let me open it.

2550
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:03,610
What are the sky bridge
and flying swing?

2551
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:06,390
You should go to Yeosu...

2552
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:08,390
- Yeosu?
- to get this penalty.

2553
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:10,890
- Yeosu?
- Yes. You'll go high up.

2554
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:13,650
And you will cross a bridge
in the air with a rope.

2555
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:15,900
- I know what it is.
- It's like the L tower.

2556
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,990
How would we go
all the way to Yeosu?

2557
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:19,020
(Sky bridge and flying swing)

2558
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,860
And you will see
the flying swing up there.

2559
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,600
The two members will ride
the swing together.

2560
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,510
My gosh. I can't do that.

2561
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:26,660
(Sky bridge and flying swing)

2562
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,570
(How would we go
all the way to Yeosu?)

2563
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,700
And it's the last day
of the long holiday season.

2564
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,200
- The traffic...
- On your way back...

2565
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,400
- It will be terrible.
- It will be tough.

2566
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,610
Gosh, I can't do this.

2567
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,150
- What's next?
- I just can't.

2568
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:39,220
This is crazy.

2569
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:41,190
- This is not right.
- Don't be ridiculous.

2570
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:43,950
(Cleaning the windows
of the SBS building?)

2571
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,860
Hey, I like this one.

2572
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:47,280
- This isn't right.
- I like this.

2573
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,930
- It will end soon.
- It's our viewers' idea.

2574
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:50,650
Do we go down on a machine?

2575
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:52,860
Yes, you will be hanging
outside the window.

2576
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,570
- How? With a rope?
- Don't be absurd.

2577
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:56,100
They have a machine, right?

2578
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,100
You might die. It's really scary.

2579
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,830
- We did it before.
- Seriously.

2580
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:00,610
- This is better.
- We tried it before.

2581
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:03,310
(You might die. It's really scary.)

2582
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:04,870
(This is better.)

2583
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:06,400
- I think...
- This is the best one.

2584
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,850
- This is the best one among these.
- That's better.

2585
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:09,820
- I can't do this.
- But this one is...

2586
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:11,580
You just say that
because you're not doing it.

2587
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,280
- I think this one is...
- That's better.

2588
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,650
This is the best thing to do
on the last day of the holidays.

2589
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:17,480
You just need to go to Mok-dong.

2590
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:18,930
Next.

2591
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:21,060
Gosh, Jeju Island.

2592
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,400
How would we go to Jeju Island?

2593
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,400
- It takes a long time.
- I'd go to Jeju Island.

2594
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,400
- I like this one though.
- This is better.

2595
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:28,490
You will be a diver
and catch abalone and octopus.

2596
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,190
- I like this one.
- I want to go to Jeju Island.

2597
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:32,140
- This is good.
- Then you go.

2598
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,230
- Me?
- You should go.

2599
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:34,700
- No.
- All right then.

2600
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:38,070
The penalty and the member
to get it will be decided next week.

2601
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:40,610
- Okay.
- My goodness.

2602
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:41,610
(Next week)

2603
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:43,110
(There are 7 penalties.)

2604
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:44,440
(And one spot is left.)

2605
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:48,080
(The madman has nothing to lose.)

2606
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,220
(And the rest of them
don't want to join him.)

2607
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:55,320
(They will be deciding
the member to get the penalty!)

2608
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:58,900
(Who's the unfortunate member
who will share pain with Se Chan?)

2609
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:03,190
(I'll see you two there.)

2610
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:06,070
(And a few days later...)

2611
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,610
(Se Chan drives a convertible car
with someone.)

2612
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:11,510
(I can go anywhere
if I have some romance.)

2613
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,770
(He also enjoys
all sorts of delicacies...)

2614
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:17,550
(and a luxurious yacht trip.)

2615
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:19,580
To the penalty!

2616
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,780
(Are you here to have fun?)

2617
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,450
(Laughing)

2618
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:24,110
(This is getting strange.)

2619
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:25,650
(What's all this?)

2620
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:28,080
(I'm sure
the other members can't do this.)

2621
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,450
This is no joke.

2622
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,820
(My goodness.
I'm getting motion-sick.)

2623
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,020
Oh, no!

2624
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:33,490
(Going crazy)

2625
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:35,140
(The member to get the strange
penalty will be revealed next week.)

2626
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,730
(Anyway, The Penalty Goes To...)
