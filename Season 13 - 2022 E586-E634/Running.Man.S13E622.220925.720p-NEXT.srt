1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,120
(The 4-week-long journey
of Whatever Penalty Project)

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,520
(Week 1)

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,630
(Grim Reaper Ji Hyo was out.)

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,690
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
received penalty stickers.)

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,590
(Week 2)

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,090
(In the roulette race,)

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,000
(Haha lost 4 times
beating all the odds.)

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,960
(Week 3)

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,300
(Se Chan was targeted by
the tough girls...)

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,940
(and received penalty stickers.)

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,300
(Week 4)

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,210
(After last week's race,)

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,710
(Se Chan got the most stickers,
and Jae Suk got exempted.)

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,420
(Se Chan will get the penalty,
and Jae Suk will be exempted.)

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,430
What is this skull?

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,430
I'm feeling at ease now.

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,220
Jong Kook, I'm feeling at ease.

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,430
- You'll be going anyway.
- I'll go anyway.

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,960
Jae Suk must be relaxed too.

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,130
- He's not going.
- Actually...

21
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,960
- He seems to be in a good mood.
- These five must be nervous.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,860
It's unbelievable
that he got exempted.

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,600
- I know.
- Which one is the closest?

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,880
We can't go to Yeosu.

25
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,500
- Yeosu is...
- Yeosu is too far.

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,180
I heard this episode would be short.

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,050
- Well...
- Should we talk less?

28
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,320
Our show usually starts at 5 p.m.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
But why does this episode
start at 4:50 p.m. today?

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,110
(It's for the new TV show,
"Sing For Gold")

31
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,220
- All of a sudden?
- Talk less.

32
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,520
Why do we have to finish at 6 p.m.?

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,330
- Does it end at 6 p.m.?
- What?

34
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,020
Hey, at this rate, we will end up
shooting short clips.

35
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,160
(At this rate, we will end up
shooting short clips.)

36
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,300
- That's too short.
- Are we doing the reels?

37
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,390
- Is it only one minute long?
- It ends right away.

38
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,990
People would want to know why.

39
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,990
The end.

40
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,030
We need to explain why.

41
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,110
I know.

42
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,940
- For the next 4 weeks...
- It's for 4 weeks.

43
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,380
- For 4 weeks.
- We will start at 4:50 p.m.

44
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,220
- Please keep that in mind.
- All right.

45
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,970
Will we have our pay cut
because it's shorter?

46
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,490
- No way.
- That's impossible.

47
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,720
We made a promise.

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,410
Thank you.

49
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,410
(Making a bow)

50
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,410
- We should thank them.
- Sure.

51
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,880
Thank you so much.

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,190
Before we decide the penalty
and the member to receive it today,

53
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,100
I will give you a last chance...

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,330
to get rid of the worst penalty
that you want to avoid.

55
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,300
If all of you
succeed in the mission,

56
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,970
you get to get rid
of one penalty you want.

57
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,300
I think the upgraded
water slide jump...

58
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,610
- is not so bad.
- I like that.

59
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,050
- You can do that.
- I like the water jump.

60
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,110
No. I'm scared.

61
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,480
But the sky bridge... Gosh, I'm...

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,310
I don't mind going to Yeosu.

63
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,390
But it's the last day
of the Chuseok holidays.

64
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,210
- It will be horrible.
- It will be a long way back.

65
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,420
- Then Se Chan and...
- Okay.

66
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,730
the other member
to get the penalty will decide.

67
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,230
Can I get rid of a few?

68
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,390
You should do that.

69
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,390
Se Chan, what is it
you want to get rid of?

70
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,390
- The window.
- First, I want...

71
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,090
- Get rid of the window.
- Actually, cleaning the window...

72
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,560
- It's too scary.
- It's about safety,

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,700
- Right.
- So I want to get rid of it.

74
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,590
- That's a good one.
- There's no way he can do that.

75
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,110
You should get rid
of the sky-glider too.

76
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,300
I will. Which one?

77
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,210
If the wind rises, you'll die.

78
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,930
I don't want to do anything
that can kill me.

79
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,110
- Get rid of this.
- Why do you keep saying that?

80
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,110
- You will get a bruise.
- The sky-glider is too scary.

81
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,210
- Right. This is...
- Do you know...

82
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,950
- which one is the least horrible?
- What is it?

83
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,680
- Becoming a diver on Jeju Island.
- The diver thing.

84
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,490
Right. Jeju Island.

85
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,310
- It's not so bad.
- But you have to get on a plane.

86
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,390
But you can get seasick
when you dive.

87
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,930
- It is hard.
- You can get nauseated.

88
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,620
- It's difficult.
- And you should wear the lead.

89
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,800
- I can't go down the water.
- You feel nauseated.

90
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,590
Then there's nothing you can do.

91
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,990
I'm not going.

92
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,200
How many penalties can we remove?

93
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,890
- Up to three penalties.
- Three?

94
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,300
There will be three missions.

95
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,960
You can remove one at a time.

96
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,110
- We will get rid of one each?
- We have to succeed.

97
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,510
- Okay.
- We can work together...

98
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,980
- as a team, right?
- Yes.

99
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,710
- This is what we can do.
- We try hard.

100
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,240
- We're good at this.
- Let's do this.

101
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,810
- Let's do this.
- This is our thing.

102
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,240
The first mission is...

103
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,210
your favorite game,

104
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,810
- drawing on sketchbooks.
- Okay.

105
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,810
(Whatever Penalty Project Mission 1:
Drawing Game)

106
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,730
- Okay.
- Sketchbook!

107
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,580
This is the upgraded version.

108
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,490
It's called Running Man
One-line Drawing.

109
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,730
- One-line drawing?
- One line?

110
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,890
- Draw without lifting the pen.
- Yes. It has the same rules.

111
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,560
But you have to draw without
lifting the pen from the paper...

112
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,300
and pass it over to the next member.

113
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,240
- Okay.
- It will be really fun.

114
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,900
You're given five seconds each.

115
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,140
If you lift your pen within
five seconds, your turn is up.

116
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,140
- Okay.
- Got it.

117
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,400
We will have
a lot of fun doing this.

118
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,210
We will probably lift the pen
and pretend nothing happened.

119
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,810
You should get 4 questions
out of 7 right to succeed.

120
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

121
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,080
Who will answer?

122
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
- It's not difficult.
- It's either Jae Suk or...

123
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
I'm good at it.

124
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,430
It's not difficult to draw
without lifting the pen.

125
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,050
- You know that, right?
- I'll answer first.

126
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,390
We should split the paper in half
for Chinese idioms.

127
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,930
- Okay.
- Do you understand?

128
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,960
- Yes.
- Let's hear the category first.

129
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,990
- What's the category?
- What is it?

130
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,200
The category is food.

131
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,510
- Food.
- Food.

132
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,970
- Okay.
- It's food.

133
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,570
It must be something complicated.

134
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,840
- Is this where you will answer?
- Yes.

135
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,000
- Okay.
- Is this where you give an answer?

136
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,300
- Jae Suk will do it.
- Jae Suk will answer.

137
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,010
There must be jjajangmyeon
or kimchi jjigae.

138
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,810
- Don't worry.
- I bet this will be difficult.

139
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,220
It's difficult to draw food.
It's ambiguous.

140
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,490
- It's hard.
- We should show if it's spicy.

141
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,590
That's a good idea.

142
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,950
- Draw a fire.
- Draw a fire.

143
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,010
- A fire? That sounds good.
- Fire.

144
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,230
- Fire means spicy.
- That's for spicy.

145
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,430
- Fire means spicy.
- Okay.

146
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,450
- Jae Suk, look that way.
- Okay.

147
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,800
You know he wouldn't
go against the rules.

148
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,300
- I never break the rules.
- I know.

149
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,430
You get five seconds.

150
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,130
Start. Five.

151
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,700
(The first question)

152
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
(Janchi guksu)

153
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,300
- Four.
- Four. Three.

154
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,610
Two. One.

155
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,700
Pass it over.

156
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,050
It's food.

157
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,810
(They were told to draw without
lifting the pen 1 minute ago.)

158
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,880
(Janchi guksu)

159
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,610
- Four. Three.
- Do it slowly.

160
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,110
Two. One.

161
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,750
- Pass it over.
- Okay.

162
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,880
It looks good.

163
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,790
- What?
- Five. Four.

164
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,030
Three. Two. One.

165
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,860
We need to describe
the first two syllables.

166
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,760
Five. Four. Three.

167
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,130
Two. One.

168
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,300
(Describe the first two syllables.)

169
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,300
Describe the first two syllables.

170
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,610
- Four. Three.
- Go ahead and do it.

171
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,370
(Whistling)

172
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,870
You can't lift the pen.

173
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,110
- What are you doing?
- Gosh.

174
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,010
- I'm sorry.
- What's with you?

175
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,590
- Hey, Haha.
- Okay.

176
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,610
- You're right.
- Don't erase it completely.

177
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,310
I'm sorry. I was confused.

178
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,860
- I'm really sorry. I'll draw again.
- Erase it.

179
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,230
- I erased it.
- You just need to apologize.

180
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,490
- My goodness.
- Erase it.

181
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,320
- You're not an amateur.
- This is ridiculous.

182
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,300
You can't write that down.

183
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,930
- I guess I was so desperate.
- Draw an anchovy.

184
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,100
I'm really sorry.

185
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,470
Okay. Let's say it was a practice.

186
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,470
- I'll draw again.
- What are you doing?

187
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,970
You committed a foul,
so you lost one chance.

188
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,500
- Why?
- No, that's not right.

189
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,840
- That can't be right.
- No.

190
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
No, this is...

191
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,150
- I'm really sorry.
- The question is...

192
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,680
I'm sorry, but I need
the production crew to come up...

193
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,010
with words
that have unique features.

194
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,380
We're not supposed
to make a random guess.

195
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,880
- All right. This time...
- Let's do this then.

196
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,680
Since we both are at fault,

197
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,110
- let's say it doesn't count.
- Right.

198
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,320
It was too...

199
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,430
You should try drawing janchi guksu.

200
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,190
It is featureless.

201
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,100
We should split the paper in half.

202
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,990
- On the left...
- Split it in half.

203
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,760
On one side,
describe the first syllables.

204
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,900
- And on the other side...
- Draw the rest of the syllables.

205
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,910
If it's pork kimchi jjigae,
draw pork on one side,

206
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,970
- and kimchi jjigae on another.
- Let's do that.

207
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,000
We can give it a try.

208
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,780
- Okay.
- Got it? Split it in half.

209
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,680
- I'll get it right anyway.
- We can do that.

210
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,980
- Split in half.
- Ready.

211
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,410
Don't worry. I'll get it right.

212
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,570
- Split in half, okay?
- Okay.

213
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,790
(Galbi dumpling)

214
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,010
- You shouldn't lift the pen.
- You lifted it again.

215
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,790
- Your turn is up.
- You lifted the pen.

216
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,250
(He split the paper in half,
and it's over.)

217
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,420
- Gosh, he's...
- I'll just draw this.

218
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,120
- You should keep drawing.
- I just split it in half.

219
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,620
- I shouldn't lift it.
- Four.

220
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,050
Three. Two. One.

221
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,800
- What?
- Hey.

222
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
(What's that?)

223
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,100
- What was that?
- This is...

224
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,100
- It's a plate.
- I guess she drew a plate.

225
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,690
- Five. Four. Three.
- What did you do?

226
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,560
(Galbi dumpling)

227
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
(Ji Hyo is trying to draw galbi.)

228
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,110
- Draw the right one instead.
- Two. One.

229
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,110
Darn it.

230
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,740
- Draw the right one instead.
- Two. One.

231
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,370
- Pass it over.
- Darn it.

232
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,980
Hey, what did you do?

233
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,510
- Five. Four. Three.
- Gosh, look at her.

234
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,940
- We messed up.
- Two. One. Pass it over.

235
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,010
(It finally looks
like a decent drawing.)

236
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,110
I'll recognize it right away.
Just draw.

237
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,590
- Draw the right one.
- Don't worry and do it.

238
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,250
- One. Pass it over.
- Don't lift it.

239
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,490
(He lifts it again.)

240
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,300
- Don't lift it.
- I didn't lift it.

241
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,490
- Don't lift the pen from the paper.
- I didn't lift it.

242
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,690
- Four. Three.
- Draw dumplings.

243
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,930
- Draw it again.
- Dumplings.

244
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,360
Two. One. You lifted it.

245
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,930
- My gosh.
- You're so bad at this.

246
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,780
What's that? Is that a wooden shoe?

247
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,200
- What's wrong with you?
- This looks...

248
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,300
just like the thing
we ate in the waiting room today.

249
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,220
- This looks like what we just ate.
- You can't say that.

250
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,870
- It looks the same.
- Why not?

251
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,510
- I mean...
- The thing next to the noodles.

252
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,050
- Isn't it food?
- It smells different.

253
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,860
- It's food, isn't it?
- The category is food.

254
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,880
When I look at this...

255
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,590
When you talked
about stock prices earlier...

256
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,590
Don't give him a hint.

257
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,600
What we ate in the waiting room.

258
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,860
- That's a big hint.
- I enjoyed it a lot.

259
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,400
- I'll guess it from the drawing.
- I ate two pieces.

260
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,300
We're not amateurs. We're pros.

261
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,560
- Jae Suk is...
- This is the tea kettle...

262
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,260
- No.
- Jae Suk, think carefully.

263
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
I don't think it's a tea kettle.

264
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,700
We split it in half.

265
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,500
- No.
- So these two.

266
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,000
That's right. We split it
in half for a reason.

267
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,420
- What do you think each means?
- What is that?

268
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,680
- The bottom one...
- I think this is ramyeon.

269
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,010
- No.
- No?

270
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,510
I think this is ramyeon.

271
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,920
- No.
- No?

272
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,160
(That's not it.)

273
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,290
- Hang on.
- Look at the right one.

274
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,600
Something's on a plate.

275
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,000
(Look at the right one.
Something's on a plate.)

276
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,530
- On a plate...
- Well...

277
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,870
- It's a shoe.
- Mapo...

278
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,370
- Shoe?
- Five.

279
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,830
- In Mapo...
- Four.

280
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,730
- Three.
- When I first ate it...

281
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,800
Dumplings.

282
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,700
- No, wait.
- All right.

283
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,830
Boiled dumplings.

284
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,100
- Wait.
- Boiled dumplings.

285
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,570
- Give me that.
- My gosh.

286
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,070
- That's not it.
- Darn it.

287
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,570
The first one is galbi.

288
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,440
- How can this be galbi?
- It's ribs.

289
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,520
- Ribs.
- We drew ribs.

290
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,050
I can't draw.
Should I give an answer?

291
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,080
It's hard to draw
without lifting a pen.

292
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,760
I'll answer.

293
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,350
- It's difficult not to lift a pen.
- I think I should give an answer.

294
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,450
Dumplings...

295
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,720
- We will change the category now.
- Isn't this better?

296
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,220
- What?
- Isn't it better this way?

297
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,690
- It's the name of a TV show.
- A name of a TV show?

298
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,690
- Suk Jin.
- From the old ones.

299
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,370
- I know a lot of TV shows.
- Hey, that's good.

300
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,670
How would we draw a TV show?

301
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,910
Se Chan, remember
we will split it in half.

302
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,640
Let's split it.
That would be better.

303
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,340
But it's difficult to draw it
with one line.

304
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,910
Why don't we just draw
one syllable at a time?

305
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,340
One syllable at a time.

306
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,920
- Really? Then I'll just draw lines.
- Ready.

307
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,440
- You don't have to.
- I don't?

308
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,840
- We will split it without a line.
- Start.

309
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,920
Don't lift the pen.

310
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,920
Gosh, this is too difficult.

311
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,430
("Young Power, Open Up Your Heart")

312
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,630
(It's a show where students shout
what they want to say on a rooftop.)

313
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,500
Gosh, this is...

314
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,630
- Gosh, this is too difficult.
- Five.

315
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,300
- Four.
- Gosh, this is...

316
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,690
- Is it still on air?
- Suk Jin.

317
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,040
- No.
- It's an old show.

318
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,170
- Pass it over.
- How would I draw this? Hang on.

319
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,460
- What's that?
- What do I do?

320
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,100
- Five. Four.
- This is...

321
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,410
- You lifted the pen.
- You can't lift it.

322
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,430
("Young Power, Open Up Your Heart")

323
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,300
- Good.
- Five.

324
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,550
(She drew a person on a rooftop.)

325
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,940
You lifted the pen.

326
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,710
You lifted the pen.

327
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,980
- Gosh, you're being too strict.
- It's...

328
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,890
so hard not to lift it.

329
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,710
- Gosh, you're being too strict.
- It's...

330
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,480
so hard not to lift it.

331
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Three. Two. One.

332
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,630
Do you remember the show?

333
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,930
I do know what it is.

334
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,220
- I bet Se Chan knows.
- That's right.

335
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,960
- No, stop drawing.
- Two. One.

336
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,370
- No, stop drawing.
- Two. One.

337
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,460
("Young Power, Open Up Your Heart")

338
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,040
- You shouldn't draw more.
- What do I do?

339
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,270
- Five. Four.
- Just erase it.

340
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,830
What's that buttocks-looking thing?

341
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,140
- What is it?
- Stop drawing.

342
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,780
- Stop.
- What are you doing?

343
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,440
Why did you draw that?

344
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,250
Now, guess what the show is.

345
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,250
I think he will recognize it.

346
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,250
Just look
at the first one carefully.

347
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,420
- It's just a drawing.
- It's a TV show.

348
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,850
He might not know
the name of the show.

349
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,710
- You watched it back in school.
- It's an old TV show.

350
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,450
- Was that when you were little?
- So Min, sit.

351
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,130
- So Min, sit.
- Was it when you were little?

352
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,930
- So Min, sit.
- Was it when you were little?

353
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,220
It's Pan Yoo Geol.

354
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,090
Just stay still.
Don't let them find fault with us.

355
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,960
Do you not know this show?

356
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,190
It was an entertainment show.

357
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,560
Why did you sit there?
I should've sat there.

358
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,570
You know the answer.

359
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,200
That's not it. You're supposed
to give the correct answer.

360
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,700
You know Pan Yoo Geol.
Then you should know the answer.

361
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,150
You have to get it from Pan Yoo Geol.

362
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,750
Young people like you
can figure out the name.

363
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,550
- But you...
- Wasn't that when you were little?

364
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,890
Just open your heart.

365
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,710
I drew two dots here.

366
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,890
Hey, you fool.

367
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,180
He's young, but he has no power.

368
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,080
It's not like we draw
"Stop Right There."

369
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,720
(Oh, right!)

370
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,450
- You get five seconds. Five.
- All right.

371
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,320
(He pretends he figured it out
himself after hearing all that.)

372
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,220
- You get five seconds. Five.
- All right.

373
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,590
He's opening his heart here.

374
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,400
"Young Power, Open Up Your Heart."

375
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,870
("Young Power, Open Up Your Heart")

376
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,910
(The producer reluctantly
accepts the answer.)

377
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,600
Good.

378
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,010
- Nice.
- Well done.

379
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,200
- Pan!
- Pan!

380
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,700
- Yoo!
- Yoo!

381
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,340
- Geol!
- Geol!

382
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,340
It was when
you were students, right?

383
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,050
- Pan Yoo Geol.
- He's about our age.

384
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,660
He said, "He's young,
but he has no power."

385
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,120
"He's young, but he has no power."

386
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,050
I was talking to myself.
You didn't hear that, did you?

387
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,660
- Why did you say that?
- For that,

388
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,350
you can just give
Seok Sam a penalty.

389
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,090
- No. He didn't hear me.
- Give him one penalty sticker.

390
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,400
- Give him one sticker.
- Give him the skull.

391
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,460
He will receive one sticker.

392
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,730
You can't give me
a penalty sticker just like that.

393
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,640
This is really serious.

394
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,830
Nice. We can do this.

395
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,410
- So you got one question right.
- Okay.

396
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,200
- This is another TV show.
- Jeon So Min.

397
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,750
- Do you want to give it a try?
- Okay.

398
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,840
"I like you."

399
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,750
- I really liked the show.
- He knows a lot of TV shows.

400
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,120
I know a lot of TV shows.

401
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,420
- All right.
- Ready.

402
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,550
Jae Suk, you know it, right?

403
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,180
Start.

404
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,080
("Law of the Jungle")

405
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,890
- Gosh, this is...
- This is easy.

406
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,930
- Gosh, this is...
- This is easy.

407
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,930
Pass it over.

408
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,450
- Why did you not draw anything?
- What did you do?

409
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,530
(He used up the time
shaking his hand.)

410
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,190
(Seok Sam's pen is useless.)

411
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,170
- Gosh, he's unbelievable.
- Is he a spy or what?

412
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,300
- Is he a spy or what?
- Three. Two. One.

413
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,200
- Pass it over.
- What's that?

414
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,510
- What did you do?
- What's that?

415
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,280
- Look at it carefully.
- Stop it.

416
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,280
Five. Four. Three.

417
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,550
- This is an easy one.
- Two. One. Pass it over.

418
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,180
- It's done.
- That's enough.

419
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,340
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

420
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,620
Pass it over.

421
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,850
That's nice. You drew a good one.

422
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,660
- Five.
- That's nice. You drew a good one.

423
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,890
- Five.
- I can...

424
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,900
- You lifted the pen.
- No, I didn't.

425
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,030
- Yes, you did.
- You did.

426
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,430
Fine. I get it.

427
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,030
- All right. You do it.
- You...

428
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,430
Four. Three. Two.

429
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,300
- I'll get it. Don't worry.
- It's done.

430
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,910
- This is done.
- You have to get it right.

431
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,270
- You will get it.
- You know what it is, right?

432
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,970
This looks like
"The Fishermen and the City."

433
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,250
For SBS, it's really...

434
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,800
- You know it.
- Stop it.

435
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,970
It's the main beneficiary.

436
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,180
(He openly tells Jae Suk
that it's an SBS show.)

437
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,440
- SBS.
- You know it.

438
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,420
- So it's an SBS show.
- It's the main beneficiary.

439
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,160
It's "The Fishermen and the City,"

440
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,550
but it's not SBS.

441
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,480
You can't say that
because it's from another company.

442
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,080
There are trees.

443
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,690
- You can't give him a hint.
- Trees.

444
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,220
Look at the trees.

445
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,170
This is a palm tree.

446
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,270
(Surprised)

447
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,770
A palm tree...

448
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,730
- I think you are amazing.
- Of course.

449
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,010
- I'm complimenting him.
- This is a mountain.

450
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,600
(He's an amazing cheater.)

451
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,380
- A palm tree...
- He should get it by now. Wait.

452
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,970
He should get it by now. Wait.

453
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,070
- He should know that.
- Oh, right.

454
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,290
- This is...
- Did you figure it out?

455
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,790
- I can recognize it right away.
- I bet he knows.

456
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,080
- You know?
- That's it.

457
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,760
(An SBS show, a palm tree,
and a mountain?)

458
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,080
This is "Law of Jungle."

459
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,390
("Law of Jungle!")

460
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,630
This is "Law of Jungle."

461
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,660
(They got 2 questions right
in a row with all sorts of fouls.)

462
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,130
This is so much fun.

463
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,090
- Why don't we...
- It's really fun.

464
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,930
- My gosh.
- A palm tree and a mountain.

465
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,690
- This is Byung Man.
- Right.

466
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,200
- Now it's a song name.
- So Min, do you want to try it?

467
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,430
So Min, do you want
to give an answer?

468
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,060
I don't think I can do it.
If I don't get it right,

469
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,410
- will you get mad at me?
- You have to get it right.

470
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,330
- Just sit there.
- She can't answer idioms.

471
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,470
- Hey.
- What?

472
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,920
- Why?
- Let So Min give it a try.

473
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,150
If you can't do this, stay seated.
We have to get rid of a penalty.

474
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,050
- If you can't do this, don't try.
- I'll draw.

475
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,290
- I'll answer.
- We have to do this.

476
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,420
- He knows a lot of songs too.
- Okay. I'll do it.

477
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,130
Jae Suk, it's a title of a song.

478
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,480
Start.

479
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,930
("Playing With Fire")

480
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,220
- This is easy.
- It's easy.

481
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,030
- This is easy.
- It's easy.

482
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,530
- Three. Two. One.
- Are you done?

483
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,170
- Pass it over.
- Gosh. Please.

484
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,670
- Come on.
- Please.

485
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,910
- One. Pass it over.
- You can't draw there.

486
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,750
You can't draw there.

487
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,070
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
Pass it over.

488
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,550
- No. That's enough.
- Stop it.

489
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,750
- Five. Four. Three.
- You can stop it.

490
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,390
Two. One. Pass it over.

491
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,580
You should put an explosive device
on the pens next time.

492
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,050
So it will explode
once they lift the pen.

493
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,190
Three. Two. One.

494
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,400
- They never listen to you.
- Pass it over.

495
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,560
- Stop drawing.
- But they never stop.

496
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Or it should give an electric shock.

497
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,190
Stop drawing.

498
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,100
- It should give an electric shock.
- Stop drawing.

499
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,040
- Stop drawing.
- My goodness.

500
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,550
They don't stop
even if you say that.

501
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,650
Take a look. This is...

502
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,310
- What did you draw?
- You can do this.

503
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,520
I think you can get it.

504
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,810
- You can get it.
- Danger.

505
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,150
- Attention?
- You get five seconds.

506
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,790
Wait. Why would you start
counting five seconds so soon?

507
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,450
Why did she draw it on the right?

508
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,080
This isn't a fire. What is this?

509
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,320
- This isn't a fire. What is this?
- Yes.

510
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,430
This is a fire.

511
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,030
Jae Suk.

512
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,220
On the left...

513
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,040
- It should be on the left.
- This is an old song, right?

514
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,430
- Yes.
- It's an old song.

515
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,300
- Jae Suk.
- "Fire?"

516
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,100
That's not it.
I didn't think it was "Fire."

517
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,470
- Is that your answer?
- No.

518
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,910
- The fire should be on the left.
- "Fire" is...

519
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,470
- It should be on the left.
- I didn't think so.

520
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,680
Is it "Fire" by BTS?

521
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,340
- No.
- I didn't think so.

522
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,920
I didn't think that was the song.

523
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,250
- You will pee.
- Five.

524
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,520
- You'll wet your bed.
- He's enjoying the fire.

525
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,080
- On the left...
- He's enjoying the fire.

526
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,760
It's dangerous.

527
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,620
- No, think differently.
- It's hot, so he can't get close.

528
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,890
- It's your nickname.
- Something different.

529
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,000
- I'm a prankster.
- That's what Suk Jin likes.

530
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
(Fire! Prankster!)

531
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,770
- Suk Jin...
- That's what Suk Jin likes.

532
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,040
"Playing With Fire?"

533
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,930
"Playing With Fire."

534
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,270
(Gosh, he got it right.)

535
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,370
"Playing With Fire."

536
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,730
- "Playing With Fire."
- He's quick-witted.

537
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,910
- Playing with fire
- Playing with fire

538
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,050
- BLACKPINK.
- He's quick-witted.

539
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,020
- Only pranksters can get it.
- He's quick-witted.

540
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,180
Are we playing charades?

541
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,290
"Playing With Fire." Okay.

542
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,810
- "Playing With Fire."
- Jae Suk.

543
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,920
So it's not like
strength versus strength.

544
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,350
No, it's not.

545
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,930
I was surprised at the last minute.

546
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,000
Is it "Twist Drama?"

547
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,930
Amazing.

548
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,130
This is a TV show, right?

549
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,460
What's the thing on the left?

550
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,060
- Hey.
- Oh, right.

551
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,090
Just stay quiet.

552
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,730
- I thought you were a tutor.
- Leave him alone.

553
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,010
- You sound like a tutor.
- Jae Suk.

554
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,140
From head to toe, hot issue

555
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,970
- "Family Outing."
- Okay.

556
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,940
(Committing all sorts of fouls,
they got the last question right.)

557
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,350
- How did you get it?
- My goodness.

558
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,920
That's where I first met Ji Hyo.

559
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,680
So the drawing game is over.

560
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,710
- Why is it over?
- We won't do it ever again.

561
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,160
- This is so fun. Why not?
- Why aren't we doing it again?

562
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,660
- This is so much fun. Why not?
- Hyung In is...

563
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
- This is our favorite game.
- Hyung In is not that decisive.

564
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,060
- Why?
- Like I said,

565
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,830
you should put an explosive unit
on the pen for a one-line drawing.

566
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,290
All right.

567
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,170
Or at least it gives
an electric shock.

568
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,730
You answered 5 questions out of 7.
So you succeeded.

569
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,730
We are good.

570
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,580
You can decide on one penalty
that you want to get rid of.

571
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,200
- Can I get rid of one first?
- Okay.

572
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,700
- You do it.
- I'll be doing it anyway.

573
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,470
I'll be going anyway,
so I want to remove one.

574
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,540
You do it.

575
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,440
- The unicycle.
- Alluvial gold mining.

576
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,120
Get rid of the sky-glider.

577
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,680
- You can't go to Gangwon Province.
- What I hate the most is...

578
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,280
- either the window cleaning...
- Okay.

579
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,980
- or alluvial gold mining.
- All right.

580
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,720
- I like alluvial gold mining.
- Remove alluvial gold mining.

581
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,560
Get rid of the window thing.
You might die.

582
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,900
- Get rid of one.
- All right.

583
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,100
- I'll get rid of the window.
- Okay.

584
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,370
(He deletes cleaning the windows
of the SBS building.)

585
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,690
All right. He got rid
of the window cleaning.

586
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,260
I should go somewhere else.

587
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,690
Who will be going?

588
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,700
This mission is...

589
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,110
a game where
you should adjust to new rules.

590
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,270
- It's called Landmine Kungkungtta.
- What's that?

591
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,200
You will play
the Kingkungtta game in turn.

592
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,380
But you're not supposed to say
three-syllable words.

593
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,850
- What does that mean?
- I see.

594
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,650
- A word with 1, 2, or 4 syllables?
- You'll play the word chain game...

595
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,420
- A one-syllable word won't work.
- Right. That's not allowed.

596
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,480
- A word with 2 syllables?
- A word with 2, 4, or 5 syllables.

597
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,390
- Ramyeon, kungkungtta
- Kungkungtta

598
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,930
- Wedding... Oh, right.
- Wedding veil doesn't work.

599
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,020
How about "noodles?"
Then you can say...

600
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,790
Smell of feet

601
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,030
You fail
if you say a three-syllable word.

602
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,670
You must go back and forth twice
to complete the mission.

603
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,910
- It sounds difficult.
- Indeed.

604
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,730
Should we say a 2-syllable word
and a 4-syllable word in turns?

605
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,810
- No, it doesn't matter.
- Oh, I see.

606
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,080
As long as you don't say
a three-syllable word.

607
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
- It's difficult. Let's do this.
- Let's go.

608
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,970
- Then I'll give you the first word.
- Who goes first? So Min?

609
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,650
- Ready. Set. Go.
- So Min will go first.

610
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,510
- Kung, kung, kung
- Kung, kung, kung

611
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,680
(They'll have 4 rounds.
The 1st round begins.)

612
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,950
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

613
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,560
Air purifier, kungkungtta

614
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,430
Train, kungkungtta

615
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,190
(Air purifier, train)

616
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,600
Now, let's get the car fixed

617
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,190
- You could've said "garage."
- Or "road."

618
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,430
Now, let's get the car fixed

619
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,810
(Now, let's get the car fixed?)

620
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,470
- Or "ticket."
- Right.

621
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,930
- A two-syllable word is allowed.
- Suk Jin.

622
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,440
- Let us start over.
- Hold on. Suk Jin didn't...

623
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,650
- He didn't understand the rule.
- What is he doing?

624
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,180
- You got confused, right?
- It's tricky.

625
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,510
- Did you do that on purpose?
- I was confused.

626
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,710
We can say two-syllable words
consecutively.

627
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,680
- "Garage" works too, right?
- Let's get the car fixed

628
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,920
"Garage" works, right?

629
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,360
- You had a lot of options.
- "Garage."

630
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,590
- Being the first to go is easier.
- Shall we start with Se Chan?

631
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,930
- Let's go in the other way.
- Okay.

632
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,520
- We're good at this game.
- Okay.

633
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,930
- Can we switch our seats?
- Let's go.

634
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,370
- It's okay.
- You've got this.

635
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,260
- Jae Suk, make sure to do well.
- Don't you worry.

636
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,730
- I'll go first.
- It was hard for me. That's why.

637
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,310
- I've played this game before.
- It's easy. Right.

638
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,340
- I've played it many times before.
- The middle seat is the best.

639
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,580
- This game is easy.
- Let's begin.

640
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,030
Ready. Set. Go.

641
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,470
- Kung, kung, kung
- Kung, kung, kung

642
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,850
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

643
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,180
- Kung, kung, kung, kung
- Kung, kung, kung, kung

644
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,820
Scarecrow, kungkungtta

645
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,350
Fertilizer, kungkungtta

646
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,910
Lately, kungkungtta

647
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,710
- What... Gosh, you.
- What?

648
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,350
- Hey.
- The third person...

649
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,390
(Lately, kungkungtta)

650
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,250
(He said a difficult word
and caused the team to fail.)

651
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,080
- Why would you pick that word?
- Gosh.

652
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,780
You could've said "cook."

653
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,220
You see, it sounds similar to "pee."

654
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,630
- "Pee."
- "Pee?" Hey, let's just...

655
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,020
- Let's just send him home.
- "Pee."

656
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,100
You said you had played this game
many times before!

657
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,490
- Then why did you do that?
- "Pee."

658
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,230
What word could he have said?
Jong Kook, there's "luunch."

659
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,060
"Luunch."

660
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,270
You could've said "luunch."
There was a word you could've said.

661
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,040
- Let's move on.
- "Luunch."

662
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,540
- "Luunch?"
- "Luunch."

663
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,810
Gosh, seriously.

664
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,950
- "Luunch vaalue meal."
- "Vaalue meal."

665
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,220
- Jae Suk, that was terrible.
- All right. I heard you.

666
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,720
Hey, switch seats with someone
if you can't do it.

667
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,080
All right. Don't worry.
I'll do better next time.

668
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,750
- Let's move on.
- I've played it many times before.

669
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,960
- Then why are you so bad at it?
- Let's do this.

670
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,250
Hey, I have a lot of experience.

671
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,050
Let's just say two-syllable words.

672
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,900
- Let's do that. That'd be easier.
- That'd be easier.

673
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,370
- Also...
- What word did you say?

674
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,430
- "Fertilizer."
- "Fertilizer?"

675
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,790
- You picked a difficult word.
- That's a hard one.

676
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,970
But there are a lot of Korean words
that start with "yo."

677
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,110
- Right. Such as "chamber pot."
- There are so many such words.

678
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,470
- I'm to blame. Ready. Set. Go.
- Gosh.

679
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,110
- Kung, kung, kung
- Kung, kung, kung

680
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,720
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

681
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,180
- Kung, kung, kung, kung
- Kung, kung, kung, kung

682
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,740
Cherry tomato, kungkungtta

683
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,650
Toto, kungkungtta

684
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,120
(Cherry tomato, toto)

685
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,280
(Toto?)

686
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,580
- Why?
- Why?

687
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,400
- "Toto" is acceptable.
- "Toto."

688
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,460
Some people call
"Saturday Night Music Show..."

689
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,720
- "Toto."
- "Toto" is acceptable.

690
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,870
- "Toto" is acceptable.
- No.

691
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,730
- Buying Sports Toto is legal.
- Jong Kook is right.

692
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,060
- It's an English word.
- It's a lottery.

693
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,370
You can find the word "Toto"
in a dictionary. It's a noun.

694
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,760
There's a rock band called TOTO.

695
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,770
- They're internationally famous.
- That's right.

696
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,800
- I'm sure you can find it.
- Sports Toto isn't acceptable.

697
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,470
- You won't accept this either?
- No.

698
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,150
- Fine. Then...
- Look it up.

699
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,190
- You can find it in a dictionary.
- A proper noun is not acceptable?

700
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,580
It's not in a dictionary.

701
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,460
- No.
- It's a proper noun.

702
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,310
- It's a foreign word.
- It's not acceptable.

703
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,130
- Is a foreign word not allowed?
- You should've told us...

704
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,490
- it wasn't allowed, Hyung In.
- Haha, we didn't know.

705
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,860
- Hyung In didn't...
- She didn't tell us that.

706
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,130
- For example, "toji" as in "land."
- She didn't tell us...

707
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,760
- a foreign word wasn't allowed.
- Foreign words commonly used...

708
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,370
- in Korea are allowed.
- I see. Now, we know.

709
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,900
(I see. Now, we know.)

710
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,060
- Okay.
- We didn't know that.

711
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,870
I'm sorry for getting upset with you.
I didn't know that rule either.

712
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,410
- Both of us are at fault, right?
- Hey.

713
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,680
Haha, you should stop using
foreign words.

714
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,950
- Both she and I are at fault.
- Okay.

715
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,950
- He... Gosh.
- Did you apologize to her?

716
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,800
Who wants to go first? Does anyone
want to switch seats with me?

717
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,180
- He said he was good at this game.
- I'll go first. Come here.

718
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,510
- Okay.
- I'll go first.

719
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,580
It's hard to be the first to go.

720
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,690
- He's so bad at this.
- I shouldn't sit here.

721
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,280
- Sorry?
- This seat is like a minefield.

722
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,190
- That's the hardest position.
- It's even harder.

723
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,480
- Come here and sit down.
- It's hard to be the second to go.

724
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,050
- You should sit here.
- Me?

725
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,220
- You sit here. I can't do it.
- Shall I sit here?

726
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,460
- This is good.
- I'll go first.

727
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,600
- Let's take it easy and go slow.
- I'll pull it off. Okay. Got it.

728
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,870
- We don't need to rush.
- We don't need to rush.

729
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,100
- Let's do it slowly.
- We've got this!

730
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,370
- It's up to us.
- Right. We can decide the speed.

731
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,640
- We're not competing.
- Right.

732
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,170
- Exactly.
- Ready. Set. Go.

733
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,210
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

734
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,470
- Kung, kung, kung, kung
- Kung, kung, kung, kung

735
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,150
Hyena, kungkungtta

736
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,920
- Butterfly, kungkungtta
- Good.

737
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,650
Emergency, kungkungtta

738
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,390
Reserve, kungkungtta

739
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,190
(Hyena, butterfly, emergency,
reserve)

740
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,250
Biru, kungkungtta

741
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,690
"Biru?"

742
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,980
- What's "biru?"
- "Biru?"

743
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,720
"Biru?"

744
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,520
(Everyone pauses
as they hear a strange word.)

745
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,860
- "Biru?"
- As in "pitiful?"

746
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,520
- "Nama biru!"
- Hey.

747
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,200
"Nama biru!"

748
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,470
(Nama biru is the Japanese word
for "draft beer.")

749
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,640
"Nama biru!"

750
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,670
Hey.

751
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,730
- "Biru."
- "Biru" as in "beer?"

752
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,730
(Se Chan must've craved draft beer.)

753
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,410
- Foreign words are not allowed.
- It's not allowed.

754
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,650
- That's a foreign word.
- Right. She said it wasn't allowed.

755
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,040
- I'm sorry.
- You could've said "bidet."

756
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,810
- Or "fertilizer."
- Hey.

757
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,420
- Or "soap."
- "Bidet."

758
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,850
- Or "soap."
- Ji Hyo said it intensely.

759
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,460
- Right.
- You said it so intensely.

760
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,660
- Okay.
- You could've said "soap."

761
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,080
She said it like this. "Reserve!"

762
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,660
- My gosh.
- This is the final round.

763
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,400
- Okay. Let's do this. Stay alert.
- Okay. Let's go.

764
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Let's keep it together.

765
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,170
- Don't speak intensely or fast.
- Okay.

766
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,700
- We've got this.
- Speak gently.

767
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,900
- I'll do that.
- Ready. Go.

768
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,470
(The final round begins.)

769
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,230
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta
- Kungkungtta, kungkungtta

770
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,210
- Kung, kung, kung, kung
- Kung, kung, kung, kung

771
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,180
- Please maintain a moderate speed.
- Got it.

772
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,570
Seagull, kungkungtta

773
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,220
Train, kungkungtta

774
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,620
Street, kungkungtta

775
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,480
- Road, kungkungtta
- Kungkungtta

776
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,510
(Seagull, train, street, road)

777
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,360
- Lo Hee, kungkungtta
- Kungkungtta

778
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,520
- Hee Soo
- Lo Hee is a name.

779
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,630
(Lo Hee?)

780
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,020
(Speaking urgently)

781
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,440
- Lo Hee.
- Lo Hee is famous.

782
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,030
- Let's keep going.
- That's not acceptable.

783
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,330
- Whom are you referring to?
- Whose daughter is Lo Hee?

784
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,030
- Jung Jun Ha's...
- It's not...

785
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,800
- Jun Ha's son is Lo Ha.
- No.

786
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,500
- Lo Hee.
- The daughter of Eugene of S.E.S.

787
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,450
- She's Eugene's daughter.
- Right.

788
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,470
- She's famous.
- I guess you don't know her.

789
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,150
- A person's name is allowed.
- Eugene must be upset.

790
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,010
- You can't keep going on like this.
- Then you could say any name.

791
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,050
You could say a random name
and say it's your cousin's name.

792
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,720
- No. Lo Hee is famous.
- They're not celebrities.

793
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,050
- She's famous enough.
- Wouldn't SOHEE be accepted either?

794
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,130
- Lo Hee is a celebrity too.
- Right. She's a celebrity.

795
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,400
When we played this game before,
"Im Chang Jung" was allowed.

796
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,600
- Yes, it was allowed.
- Celebrities' names are allowed.

797
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,170
- Why?
- Both of you are at fault, right?

798
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,640
- Right.
- Go and apologize to her.

799
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,100
- And shake her hand.
- Let's start over again.

800
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,140
- Make up with her.
- I think we should laugh it off.

801
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,440
- A word that starts with "lo..."
- Lo Hee.

802
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,210
- We're good now.
- There are a lot of them.

803
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,570
Let's say the names of stars
they would know.

804
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,240
- Let's start from "Lo Hee."
- Okay.

805
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,540
- Good.
- "Lo Ee" or "Lo Hee?"

806
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,740
- "Hee."
- It's "Lo Hee."

807
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,920
- You don't even know her name.
- That's not true.

808
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,580
- Ready...
- Wait. What did you say?

809
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,190
- Kung, kung, kung
- Kung, kung, kung

810
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,250
- Lo Hee
- Kungkungtta

811
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,250
- Hope, kungkungtta
- Good.

812
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,280
The dead, kungkungtta

813
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,790
- Seat, kungkungtta
- Okay.

814
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,370
Ribbon, kungkungtta

815
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,630
- Glue, kungkungtta
- That's good.

816
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,730
Drum, kungkungtta

817
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,560
Rum, kungkungtta

818
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,030
(They're almost done
with the first lap.)

819
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,180
Injection, kungkungtta

820
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,240
Love, kungkungtta

821
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,110
Seedling, kungkungtta

822
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,010
Type, kungkungtta

823
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,920
Ryu Jin, kungkungtta

824
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,240
- Why?
- Why?

825
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,860
- Ryu Jin, kungkungtta
- He...

826
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,390
("Ryu Jin" is not acceptable.)

827
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,580
- Ryu Jin is famous.
- Why?

828
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,750
- Let's keep going.
- Why?

829
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,550
- Let's keep going.
- Move on.

830
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,250
- Why?
- It's acceptable.

831
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,760
- Lo Hee is okay, but Ryu Jin isn't?
- Hey.

832
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,400
- It can cause controversy.
- "Ryu Jin?"

833
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,520
- It can cause controversy.
- Hey.

834
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,440
- I'm not doing this.
- Hey, Ryu Jin is...

835
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,290
Hey, Ryu Jin is a famous actor.

836
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,110
- He's an actor.
- "Ryu Jin" should be accepted.

837
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,210
Okay. Then...

838
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,300
- Let us start over again.
- Okay.

839
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,740
You failed to complete the mission
Landmine Kungkungtta.

840
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,740
- We failed?
- What a shame.

841
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,220
Yes, and you also failed
to delete a penalty.

842
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,740
- I need to delete more penalties.
- All right. Fair enough.

843
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,720
They have no choice.
They already let us off many times.

844
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,620
We'll begin the last mission now.
Please bring the set.

845
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,630
Okay.

846
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,160
What game are we going to play?
Let's pull it off.

847
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,550
Let's go!

848
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,020
What is it? I see velcro on it.
Will we throw something?

849
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,820
The long jump?

850
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,900
- Maybe.
- I think we all have to be in it.

851
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,870
We can see how good your teamwork is
through this mission.

852
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,030
- It's We Are One Heart, One Body.
- What game is it?

853
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,210
You'll put on socks
with velcro on them...

854
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,380
and take turns running and jumping
at the starting line.

855
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,740
You must land inside
the yellow lines on the square.

856
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,150
If all seven members hold out
for five seconds in it, you succeed.

857
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,120
- It's very small.
- I guess it's important...

858
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,750
to land on the right spot
so that we can all stand in the box.

859
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,930
- Those who can jump far go first.
- We can move around in it, right?

860
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,520
- You can't because of the velcro.
- We can't?

861
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,430
Please put on these socks first.

862
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,970
Your hands must not be on the floor
for more than three seconds.

863
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,100
- Three seconds?
- Yes.

864
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,760
The girls should go last.

865
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
Yes.

866
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,530
You only get three attempts.

867
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,270
- Three.
- We will succeed in it.

868
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,710
- We will do it in one go.
- All right.

869
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,350
- Don't worry.
- We don't need three attempts.

870
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,710
- I will go to a corner.
- We are good at this.

871
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,150
- Shall we give you one attempt?
- Okay.

872
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,770
- No, there is no need.
- Don't be so strict.

873
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,450
(No.)

874
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,620
There is no need to do that.

875
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,010
Also, you should use some money.

876
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,960
Don't use tape
for something like this.

877
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,390
Things should explode
if we go outside the tape.

878
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,400
Why do you like explosion so much
these days?

879
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,600
Do you want to blow everything up?

880
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,970
- Blow everything up.
- Things should explode.

881
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,400
If your hands touch the floor,
you need to get up in three seconds.

882
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,030
- Okay.
- Other people can count.

883
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,200
- Jae Suk, you are light. Go first.
- We can do that.

884
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,970
Where should I land?

885
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,230
Here. Land like this.

886
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,000
- It will be hard.
- It won't be easy.

887
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,350
The right foot should fall here.

888
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,350
- For goodness' sake.
- For goodness' sake.

889
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,620
(He planted his sock.)

890
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,310
- For goodness' sake.
- Gosh.

891
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,810
(Farmer Ji gets criticized.)

892
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,160
I did it for the team.

893
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,220
Hold on.

894
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,250
You and I should stand on the sides.

895
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,160
- Okay.
- Someone can come in the middle...

896
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,020
- and position his legs.
- Let's do that.

897
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,600
- Let's try it.
- Se Chan can do that.

898
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,700
- I will go to the middle.
- Okay.

899
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,290
- Here I go.
- Go first.

900
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,260
- Go.
- Go to the side.

901
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,530
- You will stand at the end, right?
- Of course.

902
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,030
- Stand at the end.
- Don't step on the starting line.

903
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,300
- We won't step on it.
- Go easy on us.

904
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,270
- We aren't professional athletes.
- We won't step on it.

905
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,810
- Hyung In.
- Set up explosives from now on.

906
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,920
- That's right.
- Then things will blow up!

907
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
For goodness' sake.

908
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,620
Set them up under the feet.

909
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,920
- Set up mines.
- We would receive electric shocks.

910
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,390
- Set up mines.
- That's right.

911
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,960
If we go out the designated area...

912
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,930
All right, Jae Suk.

913
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,760
- You did well.
- I did well, right?

914
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,900
- You did well.
- I did well, right?

915
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,530
- It's good.
- I did well, right?

916
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,410
Can't you... Jae Suk.

917
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,060
Can't you turn like this?

918
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,330
- Of course I can.
- You can, right?

919
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,770
- Good.
- Good. There you go.

920
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,040
- Shall I go?
- Okay.

921
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,300
- Okay.
- Hold him.

922
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,680
- Hold him if he trips.
- Here I go.

923
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,920
- I will hold you.
- Come on.

924
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,350
Here I go.

925
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,240
- My goodness. Good job.
- Good job.

926
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,460
(Jae Suk and Jong Kook landed
on either end.)

927
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,860
- Good.
- Come in as much as you can.

928
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,860
Come in as much as you can.

929
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,860
- Position yourself in the middle.
- You can do it.

930
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,100
Do you want me to jump like this?

931
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,550
- No.
- Here.

932
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,260
- Shall I try it?
- Yes. I don't understand.

933
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,490
How will you do it?
Explain it to us.

934
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,830
- I will fly into the air...
- That sounds cool.

935
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,410
and spin like this.

936
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,970
- The triple axel.
- Okay.

937
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,410
- Hey.
- I will fly into the air.

938
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,180
- Okay. Good.
- Okay.

939
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,710
- That sounds cool.
- Good.

940
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,470
- Good.
- Hey.

941
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,240
- I will jump high.
- Will you put your feet at the end?

942
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,810
- Yes.
- Go as far as you can.

943
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,620
In that case, fall into our arms...

944
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,860
and stand in a corner.
That would be for the best, right?

945
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,430
- Here I go.
- We will catch you in the air.

946
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,360
Why don't So Min do it
since she is light?

947
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,400
- No. Haha should go next.
- I am not light.

948
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,560
- Go ahead.
- Just come. It's okay.

949
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,970
Kid.

950
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,170
Fall into their arms.

951
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,790
- Yes. You did it.
- There you go.

952
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,790
(Staggering)

953
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,610
- You jumped well.
- You jumped well.

954
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,300
- Fall into their arms. Yes.
- There you go.

955
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,970
(Haha landed nicely.)

956
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,410
- You fell into their arms.
- He jumped well.

957
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,680
- He jumped well.
- He can't turn around.

958
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,270
- Face the front.
- It's okay. Hold me.

959
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,070
- There is room.
- There is room indeed.

960
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,220
How should I do it?

961
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,720
Hold on. Instead of Se Chan,

962
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,420
- Suk Jin should go next.
- Should I go next?

963
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,980
- Okay.
- Are you nervous?

964
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,220
You need to hold Suk Jin.

965
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,130
- Boom!
- Jump far, okay?

966
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,290
You are cool.

967
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,900
(He suddenly takes off his glasses.)

968
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,700
You look like Bruce Lee!

969
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,900
(You look like Bruce Lee!)

970
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,330
Lim Ha Ryong, come on.

971
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,370
Bruce Ji.

972
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,970
He won't be able to go far.

973
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,880
- Enter this way.
- After that stunt...

974
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,330
(Bruce Ji flew into the air.)

975
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,450
He did it.

976
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,240
Oh, no.

977
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,450
- My goodness.
- For goodness' sake.

978
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,810
After that stunt...

979
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,980
(Bruce Ji's flying kick...)

980
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,920
(makes the human tower crumble.)

981
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,080
- Hey.
- Come on.

982
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,280
You should have stood up.

983
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,600
Why did you push us?

984
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,290
You should have stood up.

985
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,520
You should have supported me.

986
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,700
- I held out for a long time.
- For goodness' sake.

987
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,790
- Seriously.
- Gosh.

988
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,000
- I held out for a long time.
- Gosh.

989
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,300
That's mine.

990
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,570
- Isn't it mine?
- It's mine. That's yours.

991
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,610
- Gosh.
- Seriously.

992
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,450
- I held out for a long time.
- This is so disappointing.

993
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,770
- You should have stood up.
- You know,

994
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,180
- this is hard.
- This is hard.

995
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,740
- I will go first this time.
- Okay, Jong Kook.

996
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,120
(They begin the second attempt
right away.)

997
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,860
- Gosh.
- Jong Kook.

998
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,390
- You got it.
- I got it.

999
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,390
Put your feet here.

1000
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,660
Please make sure
he continues to lift his heels.

1001
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,170
- It was the perfect landing.
- For goodness' sake.

1002
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,790
We aren't like that.

1003
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,600
- I did it.
- You did it.

1004
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,170
It begins once he climbs
on someone's back.

1005
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,870
- You did it.
- I did it.

1006
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,180
- Good.
- He went in.

1007
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,110
- That's incredible.
- He did it.

1008
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,800
- You got this.
- Okay.

1009
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,040
(They even pull off
a difficult technique.)

1010
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,720
- How did we do that?
- He did it.

1011
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,970
- Unbelievable.
- He did it.

1012
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,970
- Good.
- That was incredible.

1013
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,190
- How did you do that?
- You startled me.

1014
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,150
- Come on.
- Don't move your feet.

1015
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,690
- Ji Hyo and So Min, come here.
- This is bad.

1016
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,010
Guys, jump at once. I am exhausted.

1017
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,160
- Come on.
- Practically hug us.

1018
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,290
(Only Ji Hyo remains.)

1019
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,990
- Are we done?
- We are almost done.

1020
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,220
We are about to tip over.

1021
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,400
- Move out of the way.
- I am about to tip over.

1022
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
(At that moment!)

1023
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,500
We are tipping over.

1024
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,330
(His heels touched the floor
outside the line.)

1025
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,380
- We are tipping over.
- Se Chan's feet...

1026
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,410
touched the floor.

1027
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,910
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1028
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,970
Where?

1029
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,270
- Se Chan.
- Hey.

1030
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,040
You should have stood on tiptoes.

1031
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,620
- You should have stood on tiptoes.
- But...

1032
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,810
you pushed me too much.

1033
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,280
Suk Jin didn't jump right.

1034
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,220
If you are the 5th or 6th one,
you can't jump far.

1035
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,250
You know,

1036
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,690
- you should jump...
- There is no space.

1037
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,320
and land here as much as you can.

1038
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,220
- You are right.
- Here?

1039
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,520
We were so close.

1040
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,700
How are we supposed to do this?

1041
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,990
- I figured out a way.
- We should stand like this, right?

1042
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,870
You can go over the line
and come back, right?

1043
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,260
Of course. You just need to do it
in three seconds.

1044
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,230
- It works, right?
- We will allow that.

1045
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,800
Okay. Then we can use that method.

1046
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,970
Yes. It's simple.

1047
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,710
- Three seconds.
- Don't you need to run up?

1048
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,000
Of course I don't.

1049
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,220
- You should run up.
- It's okay.

1050
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,240
I have iron strength,

1051
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,080
- so it's okay.
- Forget about your iron strength.

1052
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,360
- This is our last chance.
- There is no need for a runup.

1053
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,130
- Is this our last chance?
- This is our last chance.

1054
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,580
- This is our last chance.
- I don't want you to regret it...

1055
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,600
- after blowing up this chance.
- Let's do this.

1056
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,130
- Okay.
- Here I go.

1057
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,490
All right.

1058
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,060
- Step on the ground and come back.
- Good, right?

1059
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,400
- There you go.
- He did it.

1060
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,300
(He takes a step forward.)

1061
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,710
- There you go.
- He did it.

1062
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,440
- That was neat.
- This time,

1063
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,500
- it's Jong Kook's turn.
- Good.

1064
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,030
My one foot can go out, right?

1065
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,970
- One foot.
- My left foot will go inside.

1066
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,500
Let's begin. Here I go.

1067
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,540
There you go.

1068
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,190
Good. The foot
should come back inside.

1069
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,510
- There you go.
- That's exactly right.

1070
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,280
- Nice.
- Good.

1071
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,780
(What?)

1072
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,250
(They show a poker face
even though his both feet moved.)

1073
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,400
- Nice.
- I almost messed it up.

1074
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,720
- Good job.
- Nice.

1075
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,400
- Will you go next?
- You should go to the center.

1076
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,600
- You did well earlier.
- Okay.

1077
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,170
- I will go next.
- Come on in.

1078
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,990
Do it the same way. There you go.

1079
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,110
- You did it right. There you go.
- Do it the same way. There you go.

1080
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,610
(Jae Suk's sock comes off.)

1081
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,240
- There you go.
- You did it right.

1082
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,240
(Glancing around)

1083
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
- There you go.
- Don't fall down.

1084
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,510
Why is the velcro here?
My foot is here.

1085
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,510
(Even the velcro is
at a weird place.)

1086
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,620
- How strange.
- Your foot is here.

1087
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,810
(The 7-member fraud ring
became even more shameless.)

1088
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,160
We did it, right?

1089
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,430
- It's a mess.
- Put on your sock.

1090
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,080
- Put it on my foot.
- His sock came off.

1091
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,520
- Put it on my foot.
- All right.

1092
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,850
You should have sewed it on.

1093
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,520
- I will put it on your foot.
- It's the production crew's fault.

1094
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,500
- That's right.
- The sock should have stuck...

1095
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,540
- to the square.
- That's right.

1096
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,200
- Jae Suk, I will go to you.
- Okay.

1097
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,270
I will step with this foot
and this foot.

1098
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,480
- Okay. Here I go.
- We almost messed it up.

1099
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,310
- There you go.
- One, two...

1100
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,700
- Good.
- Okay.

1101
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,910
- Should I go that way?
- Come on.

1102
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,770
Do the same. Go over the line
and bring one foot back inside.

1103
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,180
(It's Suk Jin's turn.)

1104
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,720
Suk Jin, your feet are taking up
too much space.

1105
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,660
- There you go.
- Put it on the other foot.

1106
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,290
- All right.
- There you go.

1107
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,350
- Come this way.
- Make some space.

1108
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,700
You should put on the socks.

1109
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,930
Come on.

1110
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,230
- There you go.
- So Min.

1111
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,500
(Success)

1112
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,700
- So Min.
- We are about to tip over.

1113
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,870
(So Min needs to enter the square
for them to remove 1 penalty.)

1114
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,330
- Just put your feet inside.
- So Min.

1115
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,430
Here she comes.

1116
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,270
- Did she come in?
- Yes.

1117
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,270
(She came in.)

1118
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,910
- She came in.
- Okay. We are about to tip over.

1119
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,890
Three, two, one.

1120
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,180
Success.

1121
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,540
(Success!)

1122
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,810
We did it.

1123
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,680
This is Running Man.

1124
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,230
Did you see that?

1125
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,120
Idol singers, bring it on.

1126
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,700
You can't do this.

1127
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,850
Why do you always challenge
the idol singers?

1128
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,560
- Idol singers.
- Yes.

1129
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,200
Good.

1130
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,700
This is
a middle-aged man's high five.

1131
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,270
- My goodness.
- Good.

1132
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,000
- We did it.
- I can't believe we did it.

1133
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,310
- My goodness.
- We did it.

1134
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,410
It was electrifying.

1135
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,200
- I can't believe we did it.
- This is Running Man.

1136
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,100
- It was hard.
- It was fun.

1137
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,410
This is the taste of Running Man.

1138
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,410
The production crew never asks us
to do the impossible.

1139
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,250
- That's right.
- I can't believe we did it.

1140
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,140
Discuss among yourselves
and cross off a penalty.

1141
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,410
- Which one should we erase?
- Sky glider.

1142
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,450
- Okay. Let's erase it.
- Sky glider.

1143
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,750
- I want to erase the water jump.
- This one?

1144
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,890
No. The water jump is better.

1145
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,250
The water jump is better.

1146
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,290
Why? The water jump is a bit...

1147
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,290
- We can't do this.
- We will keep alluvial gold mining?

1148
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,060
- We will keep it.
- Let's erase this.

1149
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,060
- Let's erase it.
- I want to erase the water jump.

1150
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,100
- The water jump is better.
- The water jump is better.

1151
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,700
- We will get bruises.
- As for the water jump,

1152
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,660
- it will end in 30 seconds.
- We will get bruises.

1153
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,910
That's right. It ends in an instant.

1154
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,600
You just go down the slide.

1155
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,910
- That's right.
- Really?

1156
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,980
- Yes.
- That's the penalty.

1157
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,000
- I see.
- You go down the slide...

1158
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,350
- which sends you up in the air.
- Yes.

1159
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,370
It's easy.

1160
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,620
- It's easy.
- We should keep the water jump.

1161
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,250
- Erase this.
- Okay.

1162
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,620
You erased the sky glider.

1163
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,790
- Alluvial gold mining.
- Alluvial gold mining.

1164
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,980
Even if we film for 3 hours,
3 minutes of it will be aired.

1165
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,180
That's right.

1166
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,180
Are we spinning a roulette?

1167
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,230
No. It's another method
that chooses a random penalty.

1168
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,230
A random penalty? Please.

1169
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,890
What's that?

1170
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,890
(What's the method
that isn't a roulette?)

1171
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,200
- Diving experience...
- What's that?

1172
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,660
- What's that?
- Diving experience...

1173
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,040
(A mysterious and huge device
appears.)

1174
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,330
They made something.

1175
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,370
- My goodness.
- It must be a bomb.

1176
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,700
- A bomb is entering.
- Will it explode?

1177
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,810
My goodness.

1178
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,770
Will a ball...

1179
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,040
Will a ball spin and come down?

1180
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,120
- What? There is another one.
- Will a ball spin and come down?

1181
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,290
- Why are there two?
- What?

1182
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:12,020
- Why are there two?
- The penalty and the member.

1183
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,790
To pick the penalty
and the penalty taker,

1184
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,290
we had special funnels made.

1185
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,790
Throw the balls with the penalties
and penalty takers...

1186
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,870
into the funnels.

1187
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,270
- We throw them inside.
- Then they will spin inside.

1188
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,390
Wait for all the balls to go in.

1189
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,100
Once you remove the sticker,

1190
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,810
you'll find out who will receive
which penalty.

1191
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,600
(The result will be revealed
after all the balls drop.)

1192
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,910
It's the ball
that lands here, right?

1193
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,370
(The sticker marks the spot.)

1194
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,390
I'm a nervous wreck.
I'd rather die than do this.

1195
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,390
- I think it'll be Haha.
- Me too.

1196
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,750
Right?
You're getting the feeling too.

1197
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,580
- Yes, Haha.
- This feeling means it's Haha.

1198
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,180
(Nervous)

1199
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,230
Then...

1200
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,120
Will four balls
have my name on them?

1201
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,430
- No, just one.
- Just the one.

1202
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,060
- Just one?
- It is as random as it gets.

1203
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,870
(It's the same probability
for all members.)

1204
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,930
Are you really going to drop it?

1205
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,560
I shouldn't be the one
to drop my ball.

1206
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,870
- But...
- We should mix it up.

1207
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,060
Only that way
will we throw it faster.

1208
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,810
(For it to be fair, they will throw
someone else's ball.)

1209
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,730
(Sighing)

1210
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,850
We'll see which penalty
you'll be receiving first.

1211
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,370
- Who will throw the ball?
- This is intense.

1212
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,120
I wonder what will get chosen.

1213
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,410
The air bicycle
seems like the best option.

1214
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,790
I think it'll be the water jump.

1215
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,060
I'm fine with everything
except that.

1216
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,060
Let's go to Jeju Island.

1217
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,580
- Don't let it be the water jump.
- Look.

1218
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,850
Jeju Island is the best option.

1219
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,000
I agree.

1220
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,000
- Shall we?
- Let's do this.

1221
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,470
- Do we start with the penalty?
- The penalty.

1222
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,560
One.

1223
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,230
Two.

1224
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,870
- Three.
- Let's do this.

1225
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,100
(They throw the balls.)

1226
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,830
- Three.
- Let's do this.

1227
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,770
(All the balls made it inside.)

1228
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,000
Which one will it be?

1229
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,370
(Which penalty will be chosen?)

1230
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,520
I wonder what it'll be.

1231
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,180
(Which penalty will be chosen?)

1232
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,910
Se Chan is already up
for the penalty.

1233
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,890
Let's reveal what the penalty is.

1234
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,200
Please remove...

1235
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,370
Please remove the sticker.

1236
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:02,500
(The penalty will be revealed.)

1237
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,970
We must be able to see through it.

1238
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,180
(He slowly removes the sticker.)

1239
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,870
Alluvial gold mining
is at the very top.

1240
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,450
What a relief.

1241
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,850
(It isn't alluvial gold mining
at least.)

1242
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,910
Here we go.

1243
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,980
- Where...
- What a relief.

1244
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,020
- It's not the diving program.
- Okay.

1245
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,520
- It's not the diving program.
- This is the worst.

1246
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,790
Jeju is out.
Just don't let it be Yeosu.

1247
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,930
(It'll be either the sky bridge,
the unicycle, or the water jump.)

1248
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,830
(What will the penalty be?)

1249
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,890
- What on earth?
- The sky bridge?

1250
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,330
- Is it that?
- That's easy enough.

1251
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,470
- What on earth?
- The sky bridge?

1252
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,500
You will be walking the sky bridge
and getting on the swing.

1253
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,330
What?

1254
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,450
Sky bridge and air swing.
What is this?

1255
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,640
In Yeosu?

1256
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,410
(The extreme activities
will take place in Yeosu.)

1257
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:57,410
(It's the penalty
they all wanted to avoid.)

1258
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,120
I can't get on it.

1259
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,580
- Me neither.
- Are we headed to Yeosu?

1260
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,500
(A long road trip
with a scary penalty)

1261
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,790
What?

1262
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,100
- Shouldn't it be the bottom one?
- In Yeosu?

1263
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,890
Must we go to Yeosu?

1264
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,500
Will we get a harness?

1265
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,410
It's terrifying.

1266
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,040
The harness and rope...

1267
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,200
We might fall off the cliff.

1268
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,270
What?

1269
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,600
The ground is beneath you,

1270
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,080
but then it's not.

1271
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,020
It'll be like stepping off a cliff.

1272
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,040
- But...
- Hold on.

1273
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,310
Could one not return from this?

1274
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,450
Of course. No one
has even come back from it.

1275
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,560
- Before...
- Where did he go?

1276
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,620
In some countries,
someone got on the swing,

1277
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,790
but only the swing swung back.

1278
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,200
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

1279
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,930
That's why it's called "air" swing.

1280
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,330
Air swing, gosh.

1281
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,200
Let's now see
who will receive the penalty.

1282
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,370
(The most important moment
of the day)

1283
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,060
You will throw someone else's ball.

1284
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,370
Someone else's ball.

1285
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,680
- We'll throw on three.
- But if we take someone else's...

1286
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,230
Luck will decide.

1287
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,500
- I...
- Haha, should I throw yours?

1288
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,640
- Shall we?
- I'm good.

1289
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,850
All right.

1290
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:58,220
(They're all ready
to throw their balls.)

1291
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,410
I'll be throwing Haha's.

1292
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,580
(I'll be throwing Haha's.)

1293
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,160
- One...
- Be the first to throw.

1294
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,910
Haha...

1295
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,120
One.

1296
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,250
Two.

1297
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,790
Three.

1298
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,970
It'll be Haha.

1299
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,120
Three.

1300
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,930
It'll be Haha.

1301
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,310
We'll now see
who will also receive the penalty.

1302
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,560
(The big reveal)

1303
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,100
As long as it's not me.

1304
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,700
- Let it be Haha.
- Haha.

1305
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,310
- Why me?
- I want you to accompany me.

1306
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,040
- Why me though?
- Because I'm fond of you.

1307
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,310
- Let it be Haha.
- This is intense.

1308
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,120
- Yeosu...
- Take your time, guys.

1309
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,180
Of course.

1310
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,140
- Why wouldn't we?
- The one at the top is safe.

1311
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,480
- Right.
- The square could be at the top.

1312
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,220
All right.
Please remove the sticker.

1313
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,350
We should see where the square is.

1314
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,250
- Here we go.
- Show me my name!

1315
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,450
(Which member will be the first
to be safe from the penalty?)

1316
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,930
- Jeon So Min.
- Haha.

1317
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,730
- Suk Jin.
- Haha.

1318
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,370
- Jeon So Min.
- Haha.

1319
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,000
- Jeon So Min.
- Whose name is it?

1320
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,970
- Haha.
- Whose name is it?

1321
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,500
It's Haha.

1322
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,230
- Yes!
- He's safe.

1323
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,580
- But Haha...
- Nice.

1324
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,540
- I thought it'd be him.
- Could it be me?

1325
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,640
Is it really my name?

1326
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,620
- Where is it?
- Haha, you're safe.

1327
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
This is so annoying.

1328
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,180
You had his ball, right?

1329
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,450
- Yes, I threw his.
- I think it's going to be me.

1330
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,730
I think it's going to be me.

1331
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,330
Thank you so much.

1332
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,750
Thank you so much.

1333
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,930
- It's Ji Hyo's name.
- Ji Hyo's safe.

1334
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,870
Ji Hyo, I'm the one
who threw your ball.

1335
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,100
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

1336
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,890
- Leave them.
- It's 1 out of 4 now.

1337
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,500
- Right now?
- No, 1 out of 3.

1338
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,640
Jong Kook, Suk Jin, or So Min.

1339
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,500
- I can't believe it isn't me.
- Who threw my ball?

1340
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,600
- I don't know.
- I threw Suk Jin's.

1341
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,580
- I threw yours.
- Hold on a second.

1342
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,120
- Wait, we're there.
- This is the one.

1343
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,020
- Who's at the bottom?
- Show who's at the bottom.

1344
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,810
- The bottom.
- Show who's at the bottom.

1345
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,980
Please let it be me.

1346
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,020
- Jeon So Min.
- It's good to be at the bottom.

1347
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,390
Whoever this is got lucky.

1348
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,620
- Ji...
- It's a good thing.

1349
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,850
Whoever this is got lucky.

1350
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,120
- Ji...
- It's a good thing.

1351
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,230
- It's "Ji."
- Ji!

1352
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,730
(Ji Suk Jin!)

1353
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,100
- I'm safe!
- Who's left?

1354
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,370
So Min and Jong Kook.

1355
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,970
- So Min or Jong Kook.
- I told her earlier...

1356
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,830
that I had a feeling
it was going to be her.

1357
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,040
(It'll be either
So Min or Jong Kook.)

1358
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,700
No, from the bottom.

1359
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,850
- No, the top.
- Let's see who it is.

1360
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,370
This person
will receive the penalty.

1361
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,370
Kim or...

1362
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,770
- This is intense.
- Two.

1363
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,140
- Jeon?
- This is killing me.

1364
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,390
Three.

1365
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,060
Jeon.

1366
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,310
(Jeon So Min)

1367
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:22,520
(Jeon So Min
will receive the penalty.)

1368
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,350
(No way...)

1369
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,470
I knew it.

1370
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:29,060
(Jong Kook survives.)

1371
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,390
You're a sweet couple, aren't you?

1372
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,970
She's following you there.

1373
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,930
Those two.

1374
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,910
- Something's pulling them together.
- Who threw her ball?

1375
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,100
It was me.

1376
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,350
- Suk Jin, you're the best.
- I threw her ball.

1377
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,850
I had a feeling
it was going to be her.

1378
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,910
She's really unlucky.

1379
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,290
She gets caught every single time.

1380
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,310
- I know.
- Still,

1381
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:50,250
- you'll be going with Se Chan.
- That's right.

1382
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,180
You're lucky it's me.
I'll be there for you.

1383
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,350
Seems reliable, doesn't he?

1384
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,020
But before he got
on the Nevis Swing...

1385
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,200
I know.

1386
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,850
- That was him.
- I'm doomed.

1387
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,430
Don't worry...

1388
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:05,230
The four-week long penalty project
has now come to an end.

1389
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,160
Se Chan and So Min,

1390
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,500
we'll see you two in Yeosu
for filming.

1391
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,370
- Sure.
- Good job, everyone.

1392
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,520
- Good job.
- Good job.

1393
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,950
Why do we need so many people
for this unpleasant event?

1394
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,480
This is wrong.

1395
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,790
I'm suddenly finding this hilarious.

1396
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,350
(They made
a long-distance trip to Yeosu.)

1397
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,930
Are we at Yeosu Airport?

1398
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,600
(They seem dispirited.)

1399
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

1400
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,430
(They seem dispirited.)

1401
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,430
Let us film the opening.

1402
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,500
Don't walk but run. Running Man!

1403
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,730
(The youngest members
of Running Man)

1404
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,430
- To be honest...
- Over here.

1405
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,980
- Our masks.
- We should take them off.

1406
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,980
It didn't seem real...

1407
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,370
until I finally landed here.

1408
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,770
I heard it was going to rain though.

1409
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,810
Wouldn't it cancel all activities?

1410
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,250
What if we slipped and fell?

1411
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,290
(They get their hopes up.)

1412
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,660
Would you rather
come back some other time?

1413
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,180
What? Why would we come back?

1414
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,890
I want it to end today.

1415
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,080
I'll break my leg
if that's what it takes.

1416
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,020
It's been a while
since we left Seoul,

1417
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,350
and now you're here in Yeosu.

1418
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,830
We call it "the youngest were going
to receive the penalty anyway."

1419
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,970
(The youngest were going
to receive the penalty anyway.)

1420
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,060
I guess you're right.

1421
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,910
One of the members
were particularly thrilled...

1422
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,730
by the fact that you two were
receiving the penalty.

1423
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,730
He sent you a gift.

1424
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,200
(A special gift
for the two youngest members)

1425
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,310
(The Yang Se Chan Car enters)

1426
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,680
It's the Yang Se Chan edition.

1427
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,450
Are you kidding me?

1428
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,720
- This...
- Are we bragging about...

1429
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,980
being in Yeosu?

1430
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,060
- My gosh.
- What is all this?

1431
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,390
No way.

1432
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,950
You ordered a convertible, right?

1433
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:35,730
(The red convertible
will take them to their location.)

1434
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,290
I haven't been
in a convertible before.

1435
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,830
No way. What are you doing?

1436
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:41,890
I'm getting the door. Hold on.

1437
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,390
You're making me uncomfortable.

1438
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,470
(Smiling)

1439
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,100
This is uncomfortable.
Do you know how it opens?

1440
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,430
- Of course.
- This is uncomfortable.

1441
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:48,470
There's an umbrella.

1442
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,980
(The driver for the day
is well-mannered.)

1443
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,270
- All right.
- A convertible.

1444
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,480
It's my first time being in one.

1445
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,370
And it's red.

1446
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,140
They got one in red of all colors.

1447
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,640
What on earth?

1448
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,850
There's a lot going on.

1449
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,120
Fasten your seat belt.

1450
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,890
- Let's go.
- Off we go.

1451
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:09,950
(They are off
to receive their penalty.)

1452
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,060
Goodness.

1453
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,290
(Laughing hysterically)

1454
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,600
Wait. Is this even a penalty?

1455
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,600
(The tour begins with an aerial shot
that can't be seen on Running Man.)

1456
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,060
- This is embarrassing.
- What?

1457
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,810
This is embarrassing.
It's embarrassing to be in one.

1458
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,080
- They're all looking.
- Hello.

1459
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,330
Oh, no.

1460
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,910
- What do we do?
- It's funny...

1461
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,980
because this is supposed
to be a secret.

1462
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,520
But we were seen
by just about everyone.

1463
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,180
Hello.

1464
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,790
This is so embarrassing.

1465
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,350
I'm embarrassed every time we stop.

1466
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,620
They all acknowledge us.

1467
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,730
The people of Yeosu are nice.

1468
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,350
What if they think
we're here on a trip?

1469
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,370
Shouldn't we tell them
that it's for a show?

1470
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,500
- Tell them.
- Hello.

1471
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,000
- Hi, we're filming.
- We're filming for a show.

1472
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,200
We're not here on a trip.

1473
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,770
Yes, I can see the camera.

1474
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:54,830
RIght.

1475
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,040
Thank you.

1476
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,700
Can you turn
"Yeosu Night Sea" for me?

1477
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,310
Right now?

1478
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,720
- When we're downtown?
- It's better this way.

1479
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,980
Better here than the expressway.

1480
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,640
It's playing.

1481
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:07,980
Good.

1482
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,120
(They force the hype
by playing an obvious song.)

1483
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,810
Yeosu, we're here!

1484
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:12,890
(They force the hype
by playing an obvious song.)

1485
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,730
- Yeosu night sea
- Yeosu night sea

1486
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,830
(A red light)

1487
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,230
Please keep going.
It's embarrassing when we stop.

1488
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:22,890
Aren't there
a lot of traffic lights on the way?

1489
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,290
I'm so embarrassed.

1490
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:36,220
(They're making a good content
for the show without being asked.)

1491
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,910
This itself is a punishment.

1492
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:44,720
(They didn't go far,
but it's red light again.)

1493
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,290
I hope we don't get caught by
a traffic light. It's embarrassing.

1494
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,250
- We came to receive a punishment.
- I see.

1495
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:52,120
He didn't even ask.

1496
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,930
You said you wouldn't say it.

1497
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,640
The air is clean here in Yeosu.

1498
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,600
It's Yeosu, isn't it?

1499
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,370
This is crazy. Come here, So Min.

1500
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,670
Why are we going up so high?

1501
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:08,690
Gosh.

1502
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,460
Why are we going up high?

1503
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,270
- Over there.
- Is it that one?

1504
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,900
It's crazy. I can't walk on it.

1505
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,810
- Don't lie.
- Don't lie. I seriously can't walk.

1506
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,810
No. What's this?

1507
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,170
(A scary sky bridge at 100m high)

1508
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,440
What if we fall?

1509
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,210
- What's this?
- How can I cross it?

1510
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,980
What's this?

1511
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,250
(Passing the wood section)

1512
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,790
I can't do it.
I think I'll stop in the middle.

1513
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:31,480
How can I go back?
Will they come to save me?

1514
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,690
No. What's this?

1515
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,020
What if we fall?

1516
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:36,790
What's this?

1517
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,000
How can I cross it?

1518
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Get off.

1519
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,090
(The cart stopped
in front of the sky bridge.)

1520
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,360
- Thank you.
- Is it really this one?

1521
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,090
Let's see if there's
safety equipment under it.

1522
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,630
- I mean...
- Get off.

1523
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,860
- Get off.
- I can't do it.

1524
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,940
There's nothing beside it.

1525
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,000
This is a footbridge.

1526
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,480
Don't go.

1527
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,670
Please.

1528
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,710
Wait for me.

1529
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,020
(She wants to have even
one more person to stay with them.)

1530
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,070
I...

1531
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,940
Come here. So Min.

1532
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,480
I feel so sick. What should I do?

1533
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,790
Is there a net on the ground?

1534
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,320
No. There's nothing.

1535
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,190
And it's so long.

1536
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,900
So Min, I don't think this is right.

1537
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,090
Can we get in there to cross it?

1538
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,500
No. We must walk.

1539
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,110
There's no net under it?

1540
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,400
What's this?

1541
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,310
I...

1542
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,310
This is no joke, So Min.

1543
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:31,110
This is the finale of the four-week
Whatever Penalty Project.

1544
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,170
You arrived at the penalty place.

1545
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:35,420
(She announced a penalty
with a bright voice.)

1546
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,480
So Min, you should stop her.

1547
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,150
Stop her from going ham.

1548
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,090
You picked it yourselves last week.

1549
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,360
The penalty you will receive...

1550
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,130
is crossing the sky bridge
and getting on an air swing.

1551
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:48,400
(Whatever Penalty Project penalty
list: 1. Sky bridge and air swing)

1552
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,900
Do we not get to choose one of them?

1553
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,340
- It was both.
- I think...

1554
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,730
I can get on the swing. But...

1555
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,900
Let's cross the sky bridge first.

1556
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,710
Some people might have fun
with this.

1557
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,480
But I'm afraid of heights.

1558
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,380
- Me too.
- It's serious for me.

1559
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,440
Why is there no one
who is crossing it before us?

1560
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,440
We don't know if it's safe
because there's no one.

1561
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,880
No. We tried it earlier.
The Assistant Director tried it.

1562
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,960
Who?

1563
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,250
Jong Seo.

1564
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,250
- The youngest?
- Jong Seo?

1565
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,250
Why can I not see him?
Where did he go?

1566
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,090
- Jong Seo.
- Is he under the sea?

1567
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,730
- Jong Seo.
- He's not here.

1568
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,090
Jong Seo.

1569
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,270
(Jong Seo disappeared.)

1570
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,000
Where is he?

1571
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,130
Hurry up
and bring him in front of us.

1572
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,340
Let us see if he's okay.
Can he speak properly?

1573
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,000
- Where is he?
- Can he walk with both legs?

1574
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,040
(Coincidentally, the youngest
producer disappeared after that.)

1575
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,310
He's coming.

1576
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,340
- He's here. Try walking.
- Jong Seo.

1577
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,920
- Try walking. Can you walk?
- They're not your legs.

1578
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:42,190
- Right?
- You can walk, right?

1579
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,790
Did you do it? How was it?

1580
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,980
If you're delusional,

1581
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,060
you'll feel
like you'll lose your mind.

1582
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,560
You will wonder
why it's made of wood.

1583
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,860
(The sky bridge makes you
think all sorts of thoughts.)

1584
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,900
It won't randomly break
in the middle...

1585
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,960
like "Squid Game," right?

1586
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,630
Right?

1587
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,130
This doesn't make sense.

1588
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:08,070
(After playing a game,
So Min decided to take the lead.)

1589
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,000
(So Min in the lead
wears the safety gear first.)

1590
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,520
I'm so sensitive right now.

1591
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,320
I'm sensitive about everything.
It bothers me.

1592
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,250
This is crazy. Come here, So Min.

1593
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,460
I really can't go.

1594
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,520
(It's an open sea in the front.)

1595
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,060
What if I fall on that pine tree?

1596
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,750
I don't think I can't do it.
There's no net.

1597
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,230
This doesn't make sense. Why...

1598
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,500
There won't be many people
who will do this.

1599
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,960
(They should walk with their legs
without handrails or handles.)

1600
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,230
(Shocked)

1601
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,270
So Min, go.

1602
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:33,540
(So Min is wearing a safety gear
and has to go now.)

1603
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,040
I'm sorry. I need some time.
I'm really sorry.

1604
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,570
Go quickly.

1605
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:40,570
(She can't easily take a step.)

1606
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,840
I didn't know
when I saw it from there.

1607
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,980
- But now that I'm here...
- Here is...

1608
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,520
I hate that there's nothing.

1609
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,060
I can see the rocks and the sea.

1610
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,590
- Look.
- Sir, let's say I shook and fell.

1611
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,060
This will protect me.

1612
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,860
But how can I come up here again?
Will you come to me?

1613
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,820
You should get up by yourself
in the middle.

1614
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,270
I should get up by myself?

1615
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,320
Does this make sense?

1616
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,570
I should get up by myself?

1617
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,340
It's even windy.

1618
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,900
Can you go first?

1619
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,400
- Please take the lead just once.
- Why?

1620
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,810
Se Chan, can't you go first?

1621
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,070
What are you going to do for me?

1622
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,250
Anything.

1623
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,570
No. You should go first today. Go.

1624
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,840
Just once.

1625
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,650
(Her colleague is strict
when he's scared.)

1626
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,040
I don't think I can go either.

1627
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,560
(Upset)

1628
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,360
- The wind is so...
- Is this scarier than the swing?

1629
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,750
It's so windy.

1630
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:30,860
- Go.
- My gosh.

1631
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,790
It's so windy.

1632
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,320
(The first step)

1633
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,570
This is driving me crazy.

1634
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,070
Once you start moving,
it will start.

1635
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,400
Start. Go.

1636
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:44,210
- You've done it.
- I'm going crazy.

1637
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,900
What should I do?

1638
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,040
You should look down.

1639
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,400
No, I mean...

1640
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,340
It's so windy.

1641
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,980
What should I do?
I really can't do it.

1642
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,610
(Her hands and feet are shaking.)

1643
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,880
Oh, my goodness.

1644
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,980
(She got to the second block.)

1645
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,420
You're done. You can move
from one block to another.

1646
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:02,690
Take a step forward.

1647
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,060
- Go.
- Am I smiling?

1648
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,360
- I'm crying.
- Take a step forward.

1649
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,420
Take a step forward.

1650
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,630
- This makes me dizzy.
- What should I do?

1651
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:09,820
Wait.

1652
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,690
What do I do?

1653
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,190
I'm in trouble.

1654
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:17,270
Yes.
People do this for an experience.

1655
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,900
Oh, gosh. What should I do?

1656
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:19,900
(So Min tries to calm herself down
by talking to herself.)

1657
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,610
What should I do?

1658
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,570
Se Chan. Hold on. Wait.

1659
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,170
Wait. This is...

1660
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,190
This is the hardest part.

1661
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,380
(Laughing)

1662
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,480
Things will become weird if you cry.

1663
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,960
Just go quickly.

1664
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,420
I'm trying not to cry,
but the tears keep falling.

1665
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,500
You can air it if I smile
while the tears are falling down.

1666
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,190
Right. Because you can
get teary-eyed...

1667
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,900
- Right?
- because of the sea wind.

1668
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,570
The viewers won't say anything
about it.

1669
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,310
You can't say "Save me."

1670
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,380
Or "I can't do this" while crying.

1671
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,500
I'm sorry.
I'm being a nuisance, right?

1672
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,040
But I'm so scared.
I'm really afraid of heights.

1673
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,210
So MIn, think like this.

1674
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,520
That you will get ten dollars
every time you step on the block.

1675
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,380
That's right. That's 20 dollars.

1676
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,290
(My goodness.)

1677
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,520
That's 20 dollars.

1678
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,980
(Her fellow penalty receiver
encourages her in a weird way.)

1679
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,150
I'm scared. What should I do?

1680
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,750
I'm smiling though.

1681
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,150
I'm so scared. What do I do?

1682
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,770
(Dizzy)

1683
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,770
("Squid Game" soundtrack)

1684
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:19,500
- What should I do?
- You're doing good.

1685
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,770
It's so fun.

1686
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,500
I'm having a lot of fun.

1687
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,000
What should I do? I'm in trouble.

1688
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,500
It'll be fine if I just pass this.

1689
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,170
I can do it once I pass this.

1690
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,250
It's very windy.

1691
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,920
(Moving forward against the wind)

1692
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,040
You're done. Okay.

1693
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,840
I'll go soon.

1694
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,590
It's fine.

1695
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,560
My gosh.

1696
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,820
(But she still has a long way.)

1697
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,520
You...

1698
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:43,750
The wind.

1699
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,960
(The wind is getting stronger.)

1700
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,070
- Oh, no.
- It's so windy.

1701
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,570
It's not windy in the middle.

1702
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,500
So Min, he said
it's not windy in the middle.

1703
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,690
- It's better to get there quickly.
- It's so windy. What should I do?

1704
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,860
- It's better to get there quickly.
- Oh, my.

1705
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,000
What should I do?

1706
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,900
Gosh, what should I do?

1707
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,900
(She has to fight the wind that
shakes her entire body.)

1708
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,270
Gosh, what should I do?

1709
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,940
Oh, my. I almost went
without the belt.

1710
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,520
Oh, my. I almost went
without the belt.

1711
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,540
(He almost left the world
thanks to the sea wind.)

1712
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,750
Put it on me beforehand.

1713
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,480
I almost went without the belt.

1714
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,860
(She's crying and smiling
at the same time.)

1715
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,130
(Crying)

1716
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:17,400
This is fun. I'm so excited.

1717
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,460
(The effect of her self-hypnosis
is getting weak.)

1718
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,020
- Take it slow.
- This is no joke.

1719
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,320
Take it slow.

1720
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,790
(Se Chan, the second one to go,
is also ready.)

1721
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,670
This is no joke.

1722
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,070
(He can only sigh at that height.)

1723
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,400
Don't look down.

1724
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,210
- Don't talk to me.
- Don't look down.

1725
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,880
I said don't talk to me.

1726
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,650
- Don't talk to me.
- It's vibrating.

1727
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:42,150
(He slowly goes forward
with shaky legs.)

1728
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,020
Done. Go.

1729
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:48,290
Take light steps.
I can feel the vibration.

1730
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,090
Take light steps.

1731
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,460
- Oh, my goodness.
- It's shaking.

1732
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,230
- What should I do?
- So Min, it's so windy here.

1733
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,090
- Just a moment.
- Go quickly.

1734
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,230
Hurry up and get to the middle.

1735
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,670
Wait.

1736
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:00,190
- Hold on. I'm straining my legs.
- It's scary here.

1737
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,210
(They can feel the strong wind
under their feet.)

1738
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,340
It's windy.

1739
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,110
It's very windy.

1740
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:09,210
(They can clearly feel
the vibration of the sky bridge.)

1741
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,570
I think this got loose.
Is this okay?

1742
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:12,880
- I think it got loose.
- It's okay.

1743
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,880
(The gear is fine,
but she feels nervous.)

1744
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,150
I'm not joking. It feels like
I'm not wearing it. Is this okay?

1745
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,360
It's loose.

1746
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,690
(He can't answer.)

1747
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,460
Oh, my goodness.

1748
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,130
Hold on. Wind, stop blowing.

1749
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:30,000
Wind, stop blowing. I said, stop!

1750
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,570
(She's not even scared now.
She's furious.)

1751
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,130
Just keep going.

1752
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,340
(Just like that, a battle
against the wind has started.)

1753
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,980
Gosh, it's so windy here.
Hey, hurry up.

1754
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,500
One, two, one... It's so windy here!

1755
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,520
It's so windy here! Gosh!

1756
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,320
Whatever. One, two. Gosh, the wind!

1757
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,840
Wind, stop blowing!

1758
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,090
So Min, let's hurry up. It's scary.

1759
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:53,060
- No. Stop shaking it.
- So Min.

1760
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,560
No, don't shake it. What's wrong?
What's wrong with you?

1761
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,960
Gosh, it feels strange.
What's with this screw?

1762
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,060
- It feels strange here.
- It's strange.

1763
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,170
Are you sure this is fine?

1764
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,570
(This is strange.)

1765
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:03,860
- This is strange.
- Oh, no.

1766
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,070
I think the screw here is loose.

1767
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,900
So Min,
I think the screw here is loose.

1768
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,710
Follow me quietly.

1769
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:11,230
I think it'll be better to go fast.

1770
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,400
- No, I can't go fast.
- It's scarier to stay here.

1771
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,500
Can I go back?

1772
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,810
(Can I go back?)

1773
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:17,150
Hey, mister! Can I go back?

1774
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,110
I want to finish crossing it
at once.

1775
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,840
I want to go fast,
but because of her, I can't.

1776
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,020
I'm afraid the steel would erode
if we stand here for too long.

1777
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,960
(A creative scaredy-cat)

1778
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,560
Hey, look at this!

1779
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,020
One, two.

1780
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,690
Oh, no. There are glass steps ahead.

1781
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,130
What do we do? It's made of glass.

1782
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:41,440
No, just go fast. I don't think
we should stay here for long.

1783
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,900
It's made of glass!

1784
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,340
- Where?
- The steps here are made of glass.

1785
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,880
- Which one?
- The steps! They're glass.

1786
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,070
They won't break.

1787
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,440
Why don't you come running?
Go ahead and try it.

1788
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,340
(Hiccupping)

1789
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:56,110
Hey, it's shaking! It's windy here!
Hey, look!

1790
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,150
(The scaredy-cat
can't get it together.)

1791
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,250
Hurry up.

1792
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,150
(Sighing)

1793
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,130
Gosh, what do I do?

1794
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,320
(So Min has stepped
on the glass step.)

1795
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,630
It's glass! Gosh, whatever!

1796
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:11,590
(She tries to get through it
by not looking down.)

1797
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:15,130
It's glass!

1798
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,460
(She crosses the glass section.)

1799
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,570
Gosh, they were made of glass.

1800
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,670
One, two.

1801
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:23,440
(Meanwhile, Se Chan was behind
following So Min.)

1802
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,420
- Gosh, what's this? Is this glass?
- It's glass.

1803
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,650
It's glass!

1804
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:29,380
I told you that there were
steps made of glass.

1805
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,880
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1806
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,250
- Gosh, what do I do?
- Step on them gently.

1807
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,750
- Gosh, it's glass.
- The wind is so strong.

1808
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,420
(He timidly steps on them
as he's afraid they might break.)

1809
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,520
- Hey!
- Gosh.

1810
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,070
(He's lost it.)

1811
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:44,670
This is so scary!

1812
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:47,270
Gosh, I want to fart.
Excuse me, I'll go.

1813
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,340
- Don't fart.
- I did.

1814
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,340
I'll kill you if you do.
Don't do it.

1815
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,040
Don't do it.

1816
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:55,270
It's so windy here!
Wind, stop blowing!

1817
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,980
Wind, stop blowing!

1818
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,710
- It's so windy! Oh, no.
- I grabbed it wrong.

1819
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,380
- I'm grabbing it wrong.
- It's so windy.

1820
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,090
Gosh, we're in trouble. The wind.

1821
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,750
- I'm going.
- I'm so dizzy.

1822
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,960
- I'm...
- Go!

1823
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,250
- I'm going.
- One,

1824
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,960
- two, one, two.
- Two, one, two.

1825
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,270
(One, two!)

1826
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:16,690
- Two.
- Let me fart.

1827
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:17,860
We're almost there.

1828
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,000
I have to fart.
Gosh, I want to fart.

1829
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:23,440
One, two.

1830
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,810
Gosh, I just...

1831
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:28,440
One... I think this part is shaking.
What do I do? I'm a bit dizzy.

1832
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,440
What's wrong with this?

1833
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,570
Gosh, I'm nauseous. What do I do?

1834
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:33,520
(Wait, this is...)

1835
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,920
This is... We're almost there.

1836
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,480
I'm almost done.

1837
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,360
I'm here now. I'm done.

1838
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,750
(So Min finishes
crossing the bridge.)

1839
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,900
(Succeeds in crossing the sky bridge
after crying her eyes out)

1840
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,270
It's so scary. It's seriously scary.

1841
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,540
One, two. I got this. Two...

1842
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,170
I got this.

1843
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:00,610
(Se Chan finishes
crossing the bridge.)

1844
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,710
- Why do people do this?
- It's so scary.

1845
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:05,420
It was so scary.
Look how sweaty I am.

1846
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,790
I know. Look how much
you're sweating.

1847
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:10,250
Don't take it off.
We have another one.

1848
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,090
- What?
- You need to get on the swing too.

1849
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,980
Gosh, seriously...

1850
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,750
(They're only half way done.)

1851
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,250
- I'm exhausted.
- Can't we use a chance card?

1852
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,590
I'm exhausted. I'm mentally drained.

1853
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,570
(An extreme air swing is waiting
for the exhausted scaredy-cats.)

1854
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:27,440
Can you carry me? My legs feel weak.

1855
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,540
So Min, the seat on the right
is scarier.

1856
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,340
- You sit on the right.
- No.

1857
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,570
Hurry. Then let's play a game
to decide.

1858
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,810
- Gosh.
- Let's play a game.

1859
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,380
- I'm just kidding.
- Let's play a game.

1860
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,670
This side is less scary.

1861
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,170
Lean far back.

1862
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,840
- Right?
- Gosh.

1863
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,650
You can start.

1864
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,590
Should I just keep my eyes closed?

1865
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,750
- Hey, what is this?
- Should I just keep my eyes closed?

1866
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,150
(The swing is going up?)

1867
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,250
- Should I just keep my eyes closed?
- Hey, what is this?

1868
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,770
Should I keep my eyes closed?

1869
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,230
How does it work?
Does it keep going up?

1870
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:57,630
I don't know.

1871
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,840
- Oh, no.
- At least with this,

1872
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,230
I don't have to move.

1873
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,570
But how does it work?
Because we don't know...

1874
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,170
- how this works...
- The director.

1875
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:06,980
Look at the director. She's tiny.

1876
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,900
- My, stop moving.
- Oh, no. Gosh.

1877
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,610
It should stop moving already.

1878
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:11,980
Stop. Why does it keep going up?

1879
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,540
I think it should stop moving.

1880
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:15,320
What's wrong with this?

1881
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,940
It should stop...

1882
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,360
(She has a bad feeling about it.)

1883
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,460
How far up will it go? Stop!

1884
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,960
Stop!

1885
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,730
I think it's going to be scary.

1886
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:29,820
We'll be fine if we don't look.
I won't look.

1887
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,960
What's going on?

1888
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,270
It's shaking. Oh, gosh.

1889
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:34,500
What's wrong with this thing?

1890
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,460
(What's wrong with this thing?
Stop!)

1891
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:38,880
Stop!

1892
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,840
Oh, please... Stop!

1893
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,480
Stop it!

1894
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,880
(The extreme air swing
starts moving in earnest.)

1895
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,790
(A thrilling swing)

1896
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:54,690
- Gosh, I'm nauseous.
- Hey!

1897
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:57,860
- Gosh, I'm nauseous.
- Sir!

1898
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,060
(The Yeosu sea unfolds below them.)

1899
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,630
(The two wax figures have frozen.)

1900
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:05,670
(His face has aged
because of the sea breeze.)

1901
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:07,570
(And she can't even open her eyes
after crying her eyes out.)

1902
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,960
- Gosh, I'm nauseous.
- Sir, stop!

1903
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,770
Stop! It's going to break!

1904
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,150
It's okay. We can do this.

1905
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,170
- We can do this.
- Gosh, my back hurts.

1906
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,770
(The scaredy-cats can't even
keep their eyes open.)

1907
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:22,110
(They probably couldn't see
the Yeosu sea at all.)

1908
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,420
It's so scary!

1909
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,150
(They probably couldn't see
the Yeosu sea at all.)

1910
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,150
So Min!

1911
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,130
I want to go home!

1912
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,020
So Min, we're done with our penalty!

1913
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,130
I won't get any penalty anymore!

1914
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,690
Gosh, stop!

1915
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:40,400
Ji Suk Jin, out!

1916
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,340
Yoo Jae Suk, out!

1917
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:43,340
Gosh, I'm nauseous.

1918
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,170
- I'm nauseous too. Hang in there.
- I'm nauseous.

1919
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:46,500
I think it's broken!

1920
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,270
- Look at the sky.
- Sir!

1921
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,270
- Look at the sky.
- It's going down!

1922
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,250
(The purpose of a journey...)

1923
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,650
(is in its process,)

1924
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,940
(not the goal.)

1925
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,880
(The trip to Gangwon Province
they've been looking forward to)

1926
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,480
(They're going to enjoy the trip
with even better weather.)

1927
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,480
It's fall now.

1928
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,250
It's so pretty here.

1929
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:05,250
(While they're enjoying their
free time with the mood of fall...)

1930
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,460
Guys!

1931
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,860
(A while ago...)

1932
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,960
(The members are faced
with two buttons.)

1933
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:15,130
(Random trip where the choices they
make result in different courses)

1934
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,130
(There's a course where they get to
jump into the Hantan River.)

1935
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,570
(This is so relaxing.)

1936
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,540
(Whereas the other members
are enjoying paradise.)

1937
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,880
(While some of them are shooting
a race,)

1938
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,040
(some are playing hide-and-seek
with their imaginary lovers.)

1939
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,650
(You never know what will happen
on this trip until it's over.)

1940
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,380
(Who will go back home
with the most impactful memories?)

1941
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:36,590
(Go? Stop?)
