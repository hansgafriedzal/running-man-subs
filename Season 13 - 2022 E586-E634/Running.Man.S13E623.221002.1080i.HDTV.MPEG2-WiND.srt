1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,030
(A day
with the typical fall weather)

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,760
(They are going to Cheorwon,
which has been put off.)

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,270
(The meeting place is
a tofu restaurant in Cheorwon.)

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,540
(It's 9:04 a.m. now.)

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,970
(Peeping)

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,290
So Min, can you open
the car door for a moment?

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,380
Why?

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,380
(Why?)

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,590
Just open it, please.

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,560
- It won't take long.
- But I have...

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,200
something personal in my car.

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,460
I couldn't sleep a wink
on my way here. I need some sleep.

13
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,240
Just open the car door.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,200
- Why? Hang on a second.
- Okay.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,870
- I need to put on some clothes.
- Okay.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,440
- I'm not wearing any bottoms.
- Okay.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,880
(She keeps saying useless things
without opening the door.)

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,550
Hello.

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,910
Thank you for coming
all the way here to Cheorwon.

21
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,780
- You don't have to get off.
- Why not?

22
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,190
You just need to make a choice
before you start a fun trip.

23
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,560
(You just need to make a choice
before you start a fun trip.)

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,660
(Make a choice?)

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,050
Choose between go and stop.

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,190
(Choose between go and stop.)

27
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,190
Why?

28
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,560
(She's suddenly told to make
a choice between the two.)

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,690
Just make a choice.

30
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,240
What if I say Go?
Am I going somewhere?

31
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,300
I can't tell you that.

32
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,300
- Choose...
- Stop.

33
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,300
Stop?

34
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,380
(She doesn't know what it is,
but she chooses Stop.)

35
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,880
- What's going on?
- Hello.

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,700
Hello. What's going on?

37
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,640
- You don't have to get off.
- Okay.

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,550
Thank you for coming
all the way here to Cheorwon.

39
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,690
Why has Running Man
changed like this?

40
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,690
(Why has Running Man
changed like this?)

41
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,690
Choose between go and stop.

42
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,860
Go and stop?

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,160
I should say Go whatever
the result may be. But why?

44
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,390
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
Go or stop?

45
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,190
(The suspicious quiz
makes him hesitate.)

46
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,740
I bet Jae Suk will say go.

47
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,560
And So Min will go straight.

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,330
Go!

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,300
- Stop.
- Go!

50
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,470
(They choose different answers.)

51
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,920
Se Chan, you chose Go.

52
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,020
You should go straight
to the opening place then.

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,450
- Is that it?
- And, Se Chan,

54
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,680
you are not having breakfast.

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,830
- What?
- While those who chose Stop...

56
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,700
enjoy spicy tofu jeongol
at a restaurant,

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,300
you will go to the opening place
eating some gimbap.

58
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,330
Darn it. That's ridiculous.

59
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,510
I should've said stop.
So am I eating this?

60
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,930
I'll put the microphone on you.

61
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,640
Oh, no. If I said Stop,
would I have gone there?

62
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,480
(He narrowly missed his chance
to visit the famous restaurant.)

63
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,790
(The first choice was
about breakfast.)

64
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,260
So Min, you chose Stop.

65
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,230
You will stop here for a moment...

66
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,300
and enjoy some healthy foods
before you go to the opening place.

67
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,520
That's nice. What would've happened
if I chose Go?

68
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,540
Myung Jae, am I really leaving?

69
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,700
Yes.

70
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,860
Stop joking around.
Am I really going?

71
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,330
Please hurry and go.

72
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,080
(Laughing)

73
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,580
Let's go.

74
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,800
(She sounds firm telling him to go.)

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,950
Okay. You wait and see.
Let's do this.

76
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,980
My goodness.

77
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,320
(With one choice, he gets kicked
out of the restaurant.)

78
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,990
(Meanwhile, So Min
who chose Stop is...)

79
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,420
I'm glad I chose Stop.

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,580
This looks delicious.

81
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,390
(Spicy tofu jeongol)

82
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,700
Look at the tofu. It looks so tasty.

83
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,070
(Savory pan-fried tofu)

84
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,700
(A decent meal you can enjoy
only when you choose Stop.)

85
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,200
It's been a long time
since I had such a healthy meal.

86
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,870
(She starts eating happily.)

87
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,300
I should eat this when it's warm.

88
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,370
(This is nothing like cold gimbap.)

89
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,110
(Savoring it)

90
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,760
It tastes so good, ma'am.

91
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,330
(Looking around)

92
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,830
I wish I could have some makgeolli.

93
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,860
(I wish I could have
some makgeolli.)

94
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,140
What do you think?

95
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,430
- That's Jae Suk's voice.
- When you were filming the front...

96
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,010
What do you think?

97
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,670
When you were filming the front,

98
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,640
I came out from the back.
You all look flustered.

99
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,850
What is this?

100
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,590
Go or stop? Choose one.

101
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,120
You know what? I always go.

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,320
I go no matter what. I never stop.

103
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,960
Okay? Go!

104
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,360
- Are you choosing Go?
- Yes.

105
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,860
What is this?

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,860
Jae Suk, you will have
gimbap for breakfast.

107
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,260
- What about Stop?
- While other members enjoy...

108
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,780
spicy tofu jeongol here...

109
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,570
you will move to the opening place
eating the gimbap.

110
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,480
If I said stop,
I would've gone in here?

111
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
(If I said stop,
I would've gone in here?)

112
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,590
Gosh, I have no luck today.

113
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,460
Where's the opening place?

114
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,810
It's a 20-minute drive from here.

115
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,050
A 20-minute drive from here?

116
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,050
(Laughing)

117
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,490
My goodness. Let's go.

118
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,420
Gosh, seriously...

119
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,260
Darn it. I'm so unlucky.

120
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,360
I would normally choose Go.

121
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,630
I go whatever the result may be.

122
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,570
(I go whatever the result may be.)

123
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,370
But I feel like I should say stop.

124
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,370
(But I feel like I should say stop.)

125
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,980
- Go!
- Okay!

126
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,920
Haha, you chose Go.

127
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,920
You should go straight
to the opening place.

128
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
(He gets gimbap.)

129
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,230
Why? What would've happened
if I chose Stop?

130
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,420
You would've eaten here
if you stopped.

131
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,960
- Gosh, are you serious?
- You should eat gimbap instead.

132
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,990
(Disappointed)

133
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,470
- Gosh.
- Seriously?

134
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,970
- They are serious.
- This is so upsetting.

135
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,670
- Did you choose Go?
- Yes.

136
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,610
I'm so upset.

137
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,000
Go or stop?

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,370
(Jong Kook also faces
the moment of choice.)

139
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,370
I'm not good at the go-stop game.

140
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,480
I just stop betting
once I make some money over a bet.

141
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,090
Make a choice between go and stop.

142
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,090
Really?

143
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,460
Go and stop?

144
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,790
Go or stop.

145
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,290
(What did the three members choose?)

146
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,490
(Laughing)

147
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,120
I wonder who's in there.

148
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,190
Jong Kook.

149
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,600
Hey.

150
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,820
Jong Kook.

151
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,600
Hey, So Min.

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,300
- Jong Kook, this is amazing.
- Is it?

153
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,540
It tastes so good.

154
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
- You know what?
- Try this.

155
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,410
I don't know how to play go-stop,
but...

156
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,430
(Card Shark Kim is not bold enough.)

157
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,480
As I said,

158
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,670
"I always..."

159
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,550
"call Stop
once I win enough scores."

160
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,070
"I don't like to take risks."

161
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,550
This is
tofu grilled on a caldron lid.

162
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,720
- Can we get another bowl... Yes.
- Rice?

163
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Hello.

164
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,180
The broth is so refreshing
like a spicy fish stew.

165
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,920
- Wait. Is someone in there?
- Ripe kimchi and shrimp.

166
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,590
- Oh, my.
- Ji Hyo.

167
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,230
- I knew it.
- I knew you'd choose Stop.

168
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,290
Ji Hyo, come and join us.

169
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,400
- I was right.
- Come. I'll scoop some for you.

170
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,490
Jong Kook, how did you know
I would choose Stop?

171
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,130
I'm sure that Suk Jin chose Go.

172
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,130
Please choose between Go and Stop.

173
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,560
Go and Stop?
I'll definitely choose Go.

174
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,570
(He chose Go right away.)

175
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,800
Of course, I choose Go.

176
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,980
What is it?

177
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,650
What is this? Gimbap?

178
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,070
Suk Jin,
you will have gimbap for breakfast.

179
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,380
Gosh. What is going on?

180
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,310
You should leave now.

181
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,920
(Reckless Seok Sam will also
have gimbap.)

182
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,310
Gosh. What was I thinking?
Why did I decide without thinking?

183
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,360
Darn it.

184
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,460
It's good, right, Ji Hyo?

185
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,490
Yes, it's so good.

186
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,560
It's really good.

187
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,820
Oh, right. So Min, I called you.
Why didn't you pick up?

188
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,240
- I was on the plane.
- You were? Oh, I see.

189
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,490
- You both turned off your phones.
- I think you called me then.

190
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,470
I couldn't call you back because
we started shooting once we arrived.

191
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,710
- And...
- In the preview, I saw you two...

192
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,110
- I know this for sure.
- riding in a convertible.

193
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,150
I'm not sure about you two.

194
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,550
But I'm sure that Haha and Suk Jin
would've cried.

195
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,590
- Trust me. It was so scary.
- Really?

196
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,790
You know the glass bridge...

197
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,180
- in "Squid Game," right?
- Yes.

198
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,380
I felt like
I was crossing that bridge.

199
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,490
A strong wind was blowing too.

200
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,960
There wasn't even a safety net
under it.

201
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,660
I'm sure it was doable
because you knew you wouldn't die.

202
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,990
(I'm sure it was doable
because you knew you wouldn't die.)

203
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,230
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

204
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,900
I don't feel scared
when my safety is guaranteed.

205
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,240
Both of their phones were
turned off.

206
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,240
And it made me think,

207
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,300
"What?"

208
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,710
"Will they stay in Yeosu for a while
after the shoot?"

209
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,110
- That's what I thought.
- What?

210
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,500
- You thought we'd stay for longer?
- Yes.

211
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,800
Actually,

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,810
we have children now
thanks to the trip.

213
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,940
We have two children.

214
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,090
People might get the wrong idea.

215
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,050
What do you mean by that?

216
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,110
On observational reality shows,
they put a doll...

217
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,420
- next to a cast member.
- Yes.

218
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,160
Just like that, the staff members
put frog dolls next to us.

219
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,920
And the dolls were so cute.

220
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,970
So I suggested that we adopt them
as our children.

221
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,900
I adopted children during that trip,
Jong Kook.

222
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,240
(She said it confidently.)

223
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,260
(Sighing)

224
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,340
You see...

225
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,810
I don't know how to react
when you say something like that.

226
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,030
I usually go along
with others' jokes.

227
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,450
(While Jong Kook and So Min are
suffocated by each other's jokes,)

228
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,580
(the other members moved
to the place for the opening.)

229
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,950
Hey, hurry up and come!

230
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,820
- Gosh.
- Hurry up!

231
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,980
(The members who chose Go
had gimbap.)

232
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,190
You guys chose Go, right?

233
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,280
Go, Jae Suk

234
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,730
- Gosh. This isn't fair.
- Go

235
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,780
- Go
- Go, Jae Suk

236
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,600
- Go ahead no matter what
- Go

237
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,930
- Go
- Go

238
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,120
- Gosh, seriously.
- Oh, man.

239
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,290
Wasn't Go the obvious choice?
Why would anyone choose Stop?

240
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,470
- My gosh.
- By the way,

241
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,710
- I can feel autumn in the air.
- Indeed.

242
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,030
(Today,
I can feel autumn in the air.)

243
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,480
How nice.
A cool breeze is blowing too.

244
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,580
This is driving me nuts.

245
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,040
- Right.
- This is driving me nuts.

246
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,140
I want to pack up and leave!

247
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,010
I want to pack up and leave!

248
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,090
- Where do you want to go?
- These days...

249
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,110
Aren't we going to shoot
for two days in a row?

250
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,220
What's with him?

251
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,460
- Haha...
- Yes.

252
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,150
Haha has been a little...

253
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,330
- stressed out.
- He wants to escape his daily life.

254
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,930
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

255
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,600
He just wants to spend
some time alone.

256
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,760
Spending some time alone?

257
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,160
Suk Jin.

258
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,240
Didn't Suk Jin choose Go?

259
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,530
- Hello.
- Suk Jin.

260
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,000
- What's wrong with your eyes?
- Why?

261
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,610
- Your eyes are so puffy.
- They're puffy.

262
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,580
It happens from time to time.
Do yours never get puffy?

263
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,810
- Suk Jin.
- Why?

264
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,850
- Hyung In and Hyo Im are upset.
- Why are they upset?

265
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,820
I mean, you should've kept yourself
in good condition for this show.

266
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,580
You went to a foreign country
to shoot another show.

267
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,220
- But I...
- Now, you look so tired.

268
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,780
- I'm not tired at all.
- It's so obvious that you're tired.

269
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,190
- I feel so energetic.
- Exactly.

270
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,560
- He looks like he worked all night.
- Then run around this place.

271
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,890
Yes!

272
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,100
Run faster.

273
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,330
- Not like that.
- Run in a bigger circle.

274
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,990
(He said he was in good condition,
but his running course is so short.)

275
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,600
- What's that?
- He understood what you said.

276
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,660
I'm excited!

277
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,740
He's faking it.

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,980
- The four of you chose Go.
- But...

279
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
- I can't believe we all gathered.
- You see, I...

280
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,310
- Seriously.
- This is the worst.

281
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,740
- I chose Go without thinking.
- We...

282
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,270
We always push ahead
like tiger moths.

283
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,110
- We push ahead no matter what.
- I chose Go without hesitating.

284
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,510
- You chose it right away, right?
- Of course.

285
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,780
I chose it right away too.

286
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,820
- I said, "Okay. Go!"
- My gosh.

287
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,190
It's so windy like in Denmark.

288
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,250
- Hey.
- Did you choose Stop?

289
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,120
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Yes?

290
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,700
You should put it on
for the opening.

291
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,060
I love this outfit.

292
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,930
- No.
- This is my favorite style.

293
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,970
- You should put it on.
- No.

294
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,200
- Or wrap it around your waist.
- Should I put this on?

295
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,470
- I really like this style.
- Should I put it on?

296
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,340
I really like this style so much.
I like the size and everything.

297
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,240
- You do? Rip this off and keep it.
- Yes.

298
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,030
You're the only one who likes it!

299
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,210
- Isn't it so nice? Look at this.
- He does look so excited.

300
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,410
It's perfect. Right?

301
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,950
The new outfit is so pretty.

302
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,190
- Se Chan.
- Gosh. She's at it again.

303
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,190
- What's going on?
- She drives me crazy since Yeosu.

304
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,410
Oh, is that the doll
you told us about?

305
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,750
- What? She's bringing a frog doll.
- What's with her?

306
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,780
Hey, our babies...

307
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,600
- They're crying.
- What's wrong with her?

308
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,430
(He laughs and says,
"What's wrong with her?")

309
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,020
- Don't just leave them with me.
- I heard a little about the trip.

310
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,620
- I almost died.
- Right.

311
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,840
Oh, she had babies?

312
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,260
- Hey, you gave birth to frogs?
- What's going on?

313
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,630
You can't make me look after them
all by myself.

314
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,030
(The mother of the frogs was
looking after the babies alone.)

315
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,900
- Hey, don't get overly immersed.
- Hello.

316
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,350
- I mean...
- Go to your daddy.

317
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,210
Go to your daddy.

318
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,180
- Let me hold my niece.
- Hey...

319
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,220
- Ji Hyo.
- It strangely looks like them.

320
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,450
So Min always...

321
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,410
- continues the story she made up.
- I can see that.

322
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,150
- Are they twins?
- They have the family name Yang.

323
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,620
- As we conceived them in Yeosu...
- Oh, Yang Yeoguri?

324
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,190
It was a short trip,

325
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,700
but it happened that way.

326
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,750
- Hey, look after your baby.
- It happened that way.

327
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,660
The babies came out so quickly.

328
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,790
- This is driving me crazy.
- So she...

329
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,360
She gave birth to them
in only ten days.

330
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,500
- That's amazing.
- Not even in ten days.

331
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,310
- In only one day.
- I must say...

332
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,340
- In only one day.
- So Min.

333
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,480
You are really something.

334
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,680
Haha created an atmosphere for us.

335
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,850
- Oh, you...
- Hey.

336
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,980
- You played Cupid.
- Did he?

337
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,450
- But they...
- Don't do that on a TV show.

338
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,720
- Right.
- They ate so well for a penalty.

339
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,540
They went there to get a penalty.
Then why did they get to eat well?

340
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,560
- That's true, but it didn't help.
- They needed to eat well.

341
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,360
- Suk Jin, the penalty was...
- No way.

342
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,830
- no joke.
- You would've cried.

343
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,090
- I'm sure of it.
- Don't be ridiculous.

344
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,060
Suk Jin,
there wasn't even a safety net.

345
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,360
- I can do it easily.
- It was so scary.

346
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,470
Send him there to try it.

347
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,120
- No way. I wasn't chosen.
- You should try it.

348
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
- I rested up thanks to you.
- He's too busy...

349
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,360
doing his show on TV CHOSUN.

350
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,260
- Oh, that show? Right.
- What kind of show is it?

351
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,840
- He's too busy...
- The one he stole your idea for?

352
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,110
- Yes, that's it.
- He stole your idea for it.

353
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,810
- I didn't steal his idea.
- Straw Ji!

354
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,810
Straw Ji!

355
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,450
- Straw Ji?
- Straw Ji.

356
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,710
Straw Ji.

357
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,040
- Straw Ji.
- Straw Ji.

358
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,350
- Straw Ji.
- I like that nickname.

359
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,080
"I'll suck all your ideas."

360
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,240
- "I'll suck all of them."
- Straw Ji.

361
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,150
- Straw Ji.
- That's so funny.

362
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,960
We finally came to Cheorwon,
Gangwon Province.

363
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,620
- We canceled it due to the rain.
- Oh, we're in Cheorwon.

364
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,830
I really wanted to come
to Gangwon Province.

365
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,750
- The sky is so clear today.
- Yes, indeed.

366
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,600
Today, we'll have Go, Stop Race...

367
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,020
- that we had to cancel last time...
- Yes.

368
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,440
- due to the typhoon.
- I should've chosen Stop.

369
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,840
- The food was delicious.
- This week,

370
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,740
for you guys who must've been
stressed out because of the penalty,

371
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,580
- we planned a relaxing trip.
- Sounds great.

372
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,740
- That's nice.
- Great.

373
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,180
- That sounds so great.
- I'm already excited.

374
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,040
Today, all you have to do is
enjoy the trip.

375
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,690
There's only one rule
in this relaxing race.

376
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,110
Just as your choices determined
what you ate for breakfast,

377
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,220
- Yes.
- you have to choose...

378
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,880
between Go and Stop...

379
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,830
- and enjoy the activity you chose.
- Really?

380
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,830
- But there's...
- I see. We have to choose again.

381
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,890
no relation between our choices
and the activities.

382
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,020
We'll keep choosing Go.

383
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,260
It will be hard for you to choose
without knowing what it is.

384
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,160
So you will play a simple game,
and those who are ranked high...

385
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,440
- will get a sound hint.
- A sound hint?

386
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,970
- That's great.
- I like the idea.

387
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,440
- We'll let you hear it.
- Nice.

388
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,270
- I like that. It sounds reasonable.
- Now, I'll explain to you...

389
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,450
about the game Egg Smash
where you can get...

390
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,350
- the first hint.
- What is it?

391
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,540
- Egg Smash?
- I think we'll smash some raw eggs.

392
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,640
- We'll place eggs here.
- Okay.

393
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,590
While all of you are standing
in a circle around the eggs,

394
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,960
- spin a bottle. When it stops,
- Yes.

395
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,120
the member
that the bottle points at...

396
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,690
- becomes the tagger...
- Yes.

397
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,930
- and throws eggs at the others.
- This is popular on social media.

398
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,990
This is popular on social media.

399
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,240
- Really?
- Do people play it these days?

400
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,630
- Some get hit on the head and fall.
- You know that he would...

401
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,660
- They throw raw eggs?
- even eat poop if it were popular.

402
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,840
It won't be popular anymore
since he knows about it.

403
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,540
The member who gets hit by an egg
gets eliminated immediately.

404
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,870
(The member who gets hit by an egg
that the tagger threw is out.)

405
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,140
But if the tagger fails
to hit anyone,

406
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,740
- the tagger gets eliminated.
- Oh, I see.

407
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,240
- One member is out in each round.
- We should run immediately.

408
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,150
- Only the final two...
- I see.

409
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,860
get a hint on the different choices.

410
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,190
(Only the final two get
a sound hint.)

411
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,750
- That's why we should wear this.
- That's right.

412
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,020
- This is a waterproof jacket.
- I see.

413
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,750
- Because of raw eggs.
- I understand.

414
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,490
- We'll begin the first mission now.
- Okay.

415
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,940
- Please bring the props.
- Let's go.

416
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,340
Attention

417
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,030
- Aim at the body.
- It won't be easy to do so.

418
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,770
I have a question.

419
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,270
What are the rules
for running away from the tagger?

420
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,480
- You can start running right away.
- Can we just run in any direction?

421
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,640
- In any direction?
- Run that way.

422
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,850
- No, that way.
- I see.

423
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,870
- We have cameras over there.
- Okay. Got it.

424
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,510
- We should run in a zigzag...
- Toward Cheorwon Station?

425
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,610
so that the tagger can't hit us.

426
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,780
Do you want to have a practice round
or begin the game now?

427
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,820
- We'll begin now.
- We'll begin now.

428
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,280
- I'll throw eggs at your bodies.
- I'm scared.

429
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,510
Who will spin the bottle?

430
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,690
- Then...
- How about Ji Hyo spins it?

431
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,730
- Me?
- Yes.

432
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,520
- Ji Hyo, get ready.
- Here we go.

433
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
- Spin it hard.
- Here we go.

434
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,790
- Here we go.
- Spin it as hard as you can.

435
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,830
It has begun, right?

436
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,360
(She spun the bottle.)

437
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,860
Get your hand off me.

438
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,970
(The person that the bottle
points at becomes the tagger.)

439
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,180
Who's the tagger?

440
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
(The other members start running.)

441
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,770
(What?)

442
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,450
(The game rule:
They must run in this direction.)

443
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,560
(Only Jae Suk and Jong Kook
ran in the right direction.)

444
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,730
(The rest ran
in the directions they wanted.)

445
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,930
- It's me.
- What?

446
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,060
- What are you doing?
- I'm the tagger.

447
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,100
Why didn't it break?

448
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,200
Oh, Haha is the tagger?

449
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,290
I'm the tagger.

450
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,260
- Gosh. I didn't know that.
- Who got hit?

451
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,470
- You all must run that way.
- Se Chan got hit.

452
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,530
That way?

453
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,630
- I didn't know he was the tagger.
- He's out.

454
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,900
- I almost threw an egg at him.
- Why?

455
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,580
- How about you start over again?
- This is...

456
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,610
I'm relieved.
Guys, let's start over again. Okay.

457
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,850
Who got hit?

458
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,850
We should start over again.

459
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,980
- Why?
- Why should we start over again?

460
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,140
The rule...

461
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,410
- Who got hit?
- Why?

462
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,510
Hey, he hit someone.

463
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,220
- He hit one of us.
- Exactly.

464
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,990
- You didn't understand the rules.
- We should've run that way.

465
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,110
- Only the tagger...
- Who didn't know the rules?

466
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,650
- That's his fault!
- He didn't know I was the tagger.

467
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,520
- The tagger throws eggs.
- That's his fault!

468
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,430
- He should've known the rules.
- Right. He should be out.

469
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,160
- And... Listen. That's not all.
- It's his fault!

470
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,520
- I asked you to run that way.
- He's out.

471
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,070
- Who ran this way?
- I did.

472
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,970
- You should've run that way.
- She told us to run that way.

473
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,810
- Then 2 of us are out.
- Yes, 2 of us are out.

474
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,110
- She told us though.
- He was eliminated.

475
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,370
- You can't go easy on him.
- Exactly.

476
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,040
- Listen to the director!
- Well said.

477
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,850
- We'll do it again.
- Are you kidding me?

478
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,580
How can you not know the rules?

479
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,640
(We'll do it again.)

480
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,190
- How can you not know the rules?
- How stern of her.

481
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,250
- Yes!
- Nice!

482
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,690
She's giving you an advantage
because you went to Yeosu.

483
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,060
What was that pronunciation?

484
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,290
- It sounded like "ad-fantasy."
- I'll spin the bottle.

485
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,330
- That's just wrong.
- It's for real this time.

486
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,570
Here we go.

487
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,930
I'll spin the bottle.

488
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,240
- Here we go.
- Make it spin.

489
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,360
What if it lands in the middle?

490
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,940
Nicely done.

491
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,580
What the...

492
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,630
I'm it!

493
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,080
(A sharp U-turn)

494
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,240
(I'm it!)

495
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,010
Ji Hyo, you're out.

496
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,010
(Ji Hyo has been eliminated.)

497
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,190
(Chuckling)

498
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,930
It's over.

499
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,290
She ran when she was it.

500
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,460
Why did she run away?

501
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,730
- Who?
- Ji Hyo.

502
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,430
I started to run away.

503
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,200
I tried to make a run for it.

504
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,100
Is it that hard
to understand the rules?

505
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,640
Why are we so bad at playing games?

506
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,410
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

507
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,940
- Hurry on back.
- Gather around.

508
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,910
- You'll then move out.
- Remember that I'm out of the game.

509
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,980
Right.

510
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,770
- What the...
- Gosh.

511
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,650
(Jong Kook will throw the eggs.)

512
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,780
- What the...
- Gosh.

513
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,890
(They run looking intimidated.)

514
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
- What the...
- Gosh.

515
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,350
(Jong Kook's target is So Min.)

516
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,660
(He throws the egg at her
since she's still in range.)

517
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,240
(He misses.)

518
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,800
It didn't make contact.

519
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,640
(Jong Kook is out.)

520
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,600
- It didn't make contact.
- Jong Kook, you're out.

521
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,950
(So Min came back from the dead.)

522
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,980
Did he get you?

523
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,070
No, he didn't.

524
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,680
- I'm out of breath.
- This isn't easy at all.

525
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,340
- I was in too much of a hurry.
- Right.

526
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,690
This is nerve-wracking.

527
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,220
- Should I spin it?
- So Min,

528
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,460
you must run
toward Cheorwon Station.

529
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,960
- You...
- Who's going the wrong way?

530
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,050
- It's you, isn't it?
- Eliminate her.

531
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,250
- You must run this way.
- Once more, and you'll be out.

532
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,630
- You'll be eliminated.
- You must run this way.

533
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,170
Gather around.

534
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,090
- I'll spin the bottle.
- What on earth?

535
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,470
- Get back here.
- No.

536
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,740
Come on.

537
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,030
Here we go.

538
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,940
Get back here.

539
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,180
(The bottle spins!)

540
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,840
- It's me.
- What are you all doing?

541
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,720
(Three members head for the eggs.)

542
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,040
(He throws it as hard as he can.)

543
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,350
- It's me.
- What are you all doing?

544
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,080
(It wasn't even close.)

545
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,160
He didn't get anyone.

546
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,320
(Sighing)

547
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,870
It's hard to hit people with eggs.

548
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,090
(He would've gotten her
had he not been greedy.)

549
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,370
- I got confused.
- What happened?

550
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,870
- I could've gotten her.
- Suk Jin, you're out.

551
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,970
Didn't he get anyone?

552
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,760
I could've though.

553
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,910
(His greed got the best of him.)

554
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,570
It's because
you went for the eggs too.

555
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,880
You should've done better.

556
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,680
- Only two more to go.
- Haha, spin the bottle.

557
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,810
- Sure thing.
- Did you go the wrong way again?

558
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,620
- No, I ran that way.
- In 1, 2...

559
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,010
Our feet...

560
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,920
- Okay.
- So Min, you're out.

561
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,010
So Min's out.

562
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,580
(He hit So Min on her side.)

563
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,900
So Min's out.

564
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,200
- Did it make contact?
- That's all you need to do.

565
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,260
- Yes, it made contact.
- Yes.

566
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,370
- Only one more to go.
- Only one.

567
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,530
Okay.

568
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,000
We were all on Team Go.

569
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,830
- Go for it.
- Go!

570
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,740
- Go.
- Spin the bottle.

571
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,830
Right?

572
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,810
(They only need to eliminate
one more person to get the hint.)

573
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,340
(Se Chan is it.)

574
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,050
(Fumbling)

575
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,190
Throw it. You're too late.

576
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,020
- You got him. Nice!
- It made contact.

577
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,490
Did I hit Jae Suk with it?

578
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,960
- Really?
- Yes, it made contact.

579
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,020
I got him!

580
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,030
(He calmly aimed a fastball at him.)

581
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,090
You got him.

582
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,090
(It hit Jae Suk's
left bottom cheek.)

583
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,440
- I got him!
- You got him.

584
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,940
- Nice!
- Jae Suk, you're out.

585
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,980
- You actually got him.
- Can you believe it?

586
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,210
I actually got you.

587
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,650
- Accurate, wasn't I?
- How did you manage it?

588
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,680
- I don't know.
- Nicely done.

589
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,450
How did you hit him with it?

590
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,740
- You reminded me of Park Chan Ho.
- I know.

591
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,310
- I sounded old just now.
- How did you do it?

592
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,010
- I almost made it.
- Park Chan Ho?

593
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,620
You reminded me of Ryu Hyun Jin.

594
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,350
(The MVP's victory ceremony)

595
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,400
Only the two of you...

596
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,250
- will receive the hint.
- Okay!

597
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,990
(Se Chan and Haha receive the hint.)

598
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,790
Please choose between Go and Stop.

599
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,210
We can choose one each
and share the information.

600
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,830
- Choose Go. I'll choose Stop.
- Will they team up?

601
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,940
Okay.

602
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,140
Let's share the information.

603
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,410
(They agree to share
the information.)

604
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,240
Go.

605
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,950
(What will he hear?)

606
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:09,160
(The hint for Go)

607
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,780
Is this rated R?

608
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,350
It must be something weird.

609
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,700
- Get your mind out of the gutter.
- That's...

610
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,430
- Next up is Stop.
- I'd choose Go no matter what...

611
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,140
since that was the wrong choice
in the earlier round.

612
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,140
What are the odds
of it being a bad choice again?

613
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,560
- I...
- I'd choose Go.

614
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,140
(The hint for Stop)

615
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,410
Se Chan, get back here already.

616
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,000
- What is it?
- Hey.

617
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,070
- Okay.
- Get back here.

618
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,150
- What did you hear?
- Hold on.

619
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,150
- Is that the hint?
- Is this...

620
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,950
- what we'd get for Go?
- What is it?

621
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,040
- What was it?
- What's going to happen?

622
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,340
- After hearing that...
- We should know that at least.

623
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,540
You can take the Go route...

624
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,350
or the Stop route.

625
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,660
Hey, mister. Why are you out here?

626
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,320
- What are you doing?
- Are you on Team White?

627
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,430
- What?
- I mean...

628
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,900
- I'm not.
- You're wearing all white.

629
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,460
- I'm Team Blue.
- Team Blue?

630
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,700
(While Jae Suk
keeps talking nonsense)

631
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,870
What I heard
was the subway line number one.

632
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,330
- What about you?
- Is that for real?

633
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,290
- Of course.
- I heard someone panting.

634
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,910
I get it now.

635
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,600
You'll each choose
either Go or Stop.

636
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,910
What did Haha hear?

637
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,740
- Are you choosing Go?
- He knows both options.

638
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,880
- I...
- Did he hear both?

639
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,950
I heard people kissing.

640
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,010
- What?
- More than anything...

641
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,010
You'll be choosing individually.

642
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,490
Of course. I...

643
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,490
- Let's not help them out.
- We could be lying.

644
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,730
Did you hear the hint for Go?

645
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,820
- Who knows?
- Beats me.

646
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,730
- Then...
- Why don't you tell us?

647
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,130
We'll brainstorm with you.

648
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,790
Did you hear a couple in love?

649
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,440
- I think so.
- That must be it.

650
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,530
- A couple in love?
- Yes.

651
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,370
I haven't experienced that
in a long time.

652
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,880
- It's hot.
- You seem excited.

653
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,910
A lot, actually.

654
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,740
My wife texted me yesterday.

655
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,010
- Why?
- Who's next?

656
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,310
- The month...
- She's not going to the US.

657
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,340
Why not?

658
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,040
- After watching the show?
- Rather than going...

659
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,750
(2 weeks ago,
Suk Jin received good news.)

660
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,190
(His wife...)

661
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,850
(will go on a trip to the US.)

662
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,550
(Chuckling)

663
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,990
(He denied it,
but he couldn't stop laughing.)

664
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,870
After watching the show,
she canceled her trip.

665
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,530
(She canceled her trip to the US.)

666
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,940
She wanted me to cancel her flight.

667
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,500
- Really?
- She texted me while I was abroad.

668
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,920
- For real?
- So I texted that I would.

669
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,070
- This is hilarious.
- Really?

670
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,540
- For real?
- She'll still go.

671
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,690
I'm sure she will go.

672
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,050
- She wants me to cancel it.
- Really?

673
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,510
That's understandable.

674
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,850
- My wife said this.
- What?

675
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,580
"Tell me your true intention."

676
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,020
"Were you that happy about it?"

677
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,490
(Not even his wife of 20 years
knew what he really wanted.)

678
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,400
So you're not going to the US.

679
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:34,140
If you stay in Korea,
you'll be able to save your family.

680
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,330
Happiness and love.

681
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,000
Happiness and love.
A happy home makes all go well.

682
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,980
Starting with Jong Kook,

683
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,410
you'll privately choose
either Go or Stop.

684
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,910
- Kook Jong.
- Why am I being called first?

685
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,100
We'll start with Suk Jin, then.

686
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,180
No, I'll go first.

687
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,810
You're a weird one.

688
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,570
- Help her out, will you?
- Exactly.

689
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,580
(The suspicious Detective Kim
goes first.)

690
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,310
I chose Stop earlier.

691
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,120
Thanks to that,
I ate a hearty breakfast.

692
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,930
How can you Stop
when you're here to sightsee?

693
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,350
Maybe choosing Stop means
you'll be doing something here.

694
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,400
(He changes his attitude.)

695
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,370
Choosing Go
will move you to another location.

696
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,320
I can't choose Stop all day though.

697
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,170
However, choosing Stop
benefited me earlier.

698
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,940
The better option
wouldn't instantly be Go.

699
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,470
That's why I'll choose Stop.

700
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,980
Because one would think
you'd choose Go.

701
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,740
(What will he choose?)

702
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,760
Go or... I'll choose Stop.

703
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,170
It's my turn now.

704
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,340
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

705
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,410
(Haha's up next,
and he heard the hint for Go.)

706
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,810
This is insane.

707
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,180
(What will Haha choose
after hearing the panting?)

708
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,120
(Se Chan heard the hint for Stop.)

709
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,390
(And he also chooses Stop!)

710
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,390
I'll choose Stop.

711
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,250
(Ji Hyo and So Min
also choose Stop.)

712
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,180
The prankster's back.

713
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,450
No matter what, he'll choose Go.

714
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,190
Go.

715
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,670
I made my choice.

716
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,840
(Jae Suk is the man
who'll always choose Go.)

717
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,340
(And so is Suk Jin.)

718
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,730
My first choice wasn't beneficial.

719
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,700
- Do I go that way?
- Right.

720
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,470
- You all made your choice.
- Sure.

721
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,150
- Go ahead and check the result.
- Let's see what we chose.

722
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,470
This is course number one.

723
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,650
Please!

724
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,780
Please let Go be more beneficial.

725
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,010
- Not two times in a row.
- Please.

726
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,860
Those who chose Go...

727
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,980
are Suk Jin and Jae Suk.

728
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,130
- Really?
- Just us two?

729
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,660
- See?
- Well,

730
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,330
let's see what's in store
for Team Stop.

731
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,330
The two of them...

732
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,690
- on Team Stop means...
- Seriously, you two are...

733
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,220
- We heard.
- We got the hint.

734
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,720
- This is your problem.
- Why?

735
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,340
You don't know that.
The hint could've been a trap.

736
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,730
Please.

737
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,470
(Everyone but Jae Suk and Suk Jin
chose Stop. What is it for?)

738
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,740
Stop. "Those who don't want
to sweat will take the monorail."

739
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,470
- I knew it.
- That's right.

740
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,040
(They get to ride the monorail.)

741
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,710
- All right.
- Okay.

742
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,740
I don't want to sweat
on a day like this.

743
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,420
Stop is a good thing.

744
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,210
Jong Kook got it right away.

745
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,920
(What is Go for then?)

746
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,090
- I see.
- Gosh.

747
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,630
- The observatory on Mount Soi.
- They walk to the observatory.

748
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,100
- Okay.
- This is the worst.

749
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,330
(They will walk
to the top of the mountain.)

750
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,870
- This is the worst.
- Okay. It's hot today.

751
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,870
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

752
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,290
- Right.
- It won't even be fun to watch.

753
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,730
- Hang on. This is...
- Listen.

754
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,840
It's good exercise.

755
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,340
Go wasn't a good thing before,
so it should be good this time.

756
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,380
That's not true.

757
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,200
- And the worst part is this.
- What?

758
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,040
It will take a long time to walk
to the top of the mountain,

759
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,470
- but it won't be fun to watch.
- It's no fun.

760
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,040
So you should make it fun.

761
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,510
You guys should hold hands
and kiss each other.

762
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,590
- Try anything.
- You know what to do.

763
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,450
It took us an hour and a half
to shoot his YouTube video.

764
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,820
And we got three episodes.

765
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,860
I know.

766
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,930
You should make it fun
as you walk. It's your thing.

767
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,020
- This is so annoying.
- It's your thing.

768
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,870
The hint for Go was...

769
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,070
a voice of a dying person.

770
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,460
This one?

771
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,370
(The hint for Go)

772
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:43,730
(The hint for Stop)

773
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,940
This is nuts.

774
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,770
If things go wrong, I will
have to carry Suk Jin on my back.

775
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,880
(Luggage)

776
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
All right then.

777
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,820
Let's go enjoy the first course now.

778
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

779
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,210
- Seriously, this is the worst.
- I just ate.

780
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,820
Which monorail train are we taking?

781
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,980
(Team Stop go to enjoy
the monorail train.)

782
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,860
Let's hurry and go.

783
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,220
Go.

784
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,600
This reminds me of the time.

785
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,100
When we went to Switzerland,

786
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,370
- we took the train.
- I wasn't there.

787
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,530
So Min wasn't there.

788
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,990
- Switzerland?
- Let's talk about Switzerland.

789
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,500
- My gosh.
- So Min, you weren't there?

790
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,930
I wasn't there.

791
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,000
She wasn't.

792
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,470
- Hello.
- The middle one?

793
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,850
This is like the one
at an amusement park, right?

794
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,200
This is nice.

795
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,270
Get in the front seats.

796
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,980
You should get
in the front seats with Se Chan.

797
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,010
- In the front.
- Good.

798
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,090
- No, Jong Kook. We're just friends.
- I'll go back.

799
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,280
- I'll sit in the back seats.
- I know.

800
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,660
- I know you two are friends.
- We're friends.

801
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,090
- No, I'll sit here.
- Okay.

802
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,090
- Fasten your seat belt.
- Your seat belt.

803
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,630
Do we have a seat belt?

804
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,870
Se Chan, we need you
to sit in the very back.

805
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,460
Really? Here?

806
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,140
(She's alone again.)

807
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,340
Like this?

808
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,760
- Hey.
- This is good.

809
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,610
He didn't do it on purpose.

810
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,410
- I have no choice.
- He didn't intend to do this.

811
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,150
- This is not what he intended.
- Go.

812
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,270
Shall we go now?

813
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,820
Yes. Let's go.

814
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,480
We should look ahead
when the train leaves.

815
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,510
(We should look ahead
when the train leaves.)

816
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,120
- You should look ahead.
- Look straight ahead.

817
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,590
- It's dangerous.
- So Min, this is about our viewers.

818
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,430
- Don't care about us.
- We'll just stay here in the back.

819
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,600
Our viewers would want
to see your face.

820
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,900
Let's go.

821
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,490
Go.

822
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,990
(Sighing)

823
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,370
So this is what Cheorwon looks like.

824
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,460
(When the monorail train leaves...)

825
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,870
This is really nice.

826
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,880
The weather is nice.

827
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,110
What is this field for?
Is it for perilla seeds?

828
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,470
- Are they perilla leaves?
- I think so.

829
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,710
They are perilla leaves.

830
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Now you two will walk from here
to the observatory.

831
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,480
- You should know this.
- You're being so mean.

832
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,980
In a variety show,
it is hard to make...

833
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,020
scenes about hiking interesting.

834
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,100
- It's no fun.
- But we will make it interesting.

835
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
(But we will make it interesting.)

836
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,460
Hey, what are you talking about?

837
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,870
- You...
- You just stay still.

838
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,640
- When you went to Macau Tower...
- I'm talking here.

839
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,930
- with Kwang Soo,
- Just stay quiet.

840
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,110
it aired for 1 minute and 30 seconds
while it took you 3 hours.

841
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,470
It was the worst back then.

842
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,410
Seriously, it was terrible.

843
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,410
- Because I have a fear of heights.
- Give me the camera.

844
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,540
Isn't this for us?

845
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,940
- The thing is...
- Why are you holding this?

846
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,710
- I can carry it.
- This is for me.

847
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,090
It's mine.

848
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,210
It's mine!

849
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,210
Suk Jin, the captain
should carry this.

850
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,590
- You're not the captain.
- I'm the captain.

851
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,130
You know I'm a YouTuber.
I'm used to stuff like this.

852
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,400
Suk Jin. You do it...

853
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,750
only for advertisements.
You can't call yourself a YouTuber.

854
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,330
Hello, everyone.
We are at the foot of Mount Soi now.

855
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,640
What is the trail called?

856
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,930
What is the trail called?

857
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,500
(The prankster is here.)

858
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,840
Stop it.

859
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,580
What is the trail called?
I think I just heard it.

860
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,700
This is Garosu-gil.

861
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,610
Everyone, this is Garosu-gil.

862
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,270
- You didn't know...
- It's a tree-lined street.

863
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,480
there was a trail like this
on Garosu-gil, right?

864
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,280
(He loses the camera
to Jae Suk again.)

865
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Gosh, why are you
swinging the camera?

866
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,590
Nice shot.

867
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,430
Hello, dear viewers.

868
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,250
We are on a beautiful road
in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province.

869
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,870
In the beautiful forest... Hey.

870
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,840
(He keeps saying his opening line
over and over again.)

871
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,610
Get off me. This is my opening line.

872
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,000
- Suk Jin, that's...
- This place is...

873
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,840
called Sayo-gil.

874
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,580
Look at this. You know
the famous meme of mine, right?

875
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,610
What is it?

876
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,010
What are you doing?

877
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,710
Oh, that thing. I think I saw it.

878
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,660
It was from the 2000s.
I saw the meme.

879
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,430
Something like this will help.
What you are doing is...

880
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,280
- Hello, dear viewers.
- That doesn't help at all.

881
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,720
We just compared Jae Suk's photo
from 20 years ago...

882
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,400
with the one of now.

883
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,760
He's aged a lot, right?

884
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,640
Gosh, how could he...

885
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,790
No one's laughing.

886
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,840
I'm not trying to make you laugh.

887
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,140
(Seok Sam is trying to make this fun
without making people laugh.)

888
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,840
Darn it. Gosh, seriously.

889
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,880
(Sighing)

890
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,240
Why are you doing this?

891
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,620
Why are you yelling at me?

892
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,620
- I'm not yelling.
- You've become quick-tempered.

893
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,120
I'm not yelling.

894
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
(Covering his microphone)

895
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,660
Gosh, you're being so annoying.

896
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,720
(Gosh, you're being so annoying.)

897
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,360
Why am I here with him?

898
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,860
(While these two are struggling
to make this show interesting...)

899
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,600
It's going up.

900
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,030
Look at the weather. It's so nice.

901
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,840
It's great. Cheorwon is so nice.

902
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,960
I love Cheorwon!

903
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,730
The weather is beautiful.
What do we do?

904
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,500
Isn't this too slow, by the way?

905
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,380
It should be slow
so we can appreciate...

906
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,820
- the view.
- Exactly.

907
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,120
It was this slow when we took
the train in Switzerland.

908
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,820
- Switzerland?
- The speed is perfect.

909
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,390
It doesn't have to be fast.

910
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,620
- And you can open the windows.
- You should enjoy the scenery.

911
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,450
- Switzerland?
- Yes. It was really nice.

912
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,130
- Swiss.
- It is read the same when flipped.

913
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,950
- Straight or flipped.
- Yes.

914
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,460
It was amazing.
Do you remember that?

915
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,190
We met the chef in Italy...

916
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,930
- Of course.
- Oh, right.

917
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,370
- When?
- You mean, at the hotel?

918
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,570
Yes, at the hotel.

919
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,140
- You mean Tom Cruise's chef?
- Yes.

920
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,500
We had that thing there.

921
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,740
Something like
the Mediterranean menu.

922
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,940
What? Mediterranean?

923
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,150
I think you're eating your hair now.

924
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,510
(She can't get
into the conversation with them.)

925
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,510
We had the truffle there back then.

926
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,820
- Right, the truffle.
- Back then...

927
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,820
Se Chan made a video call.

928
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,480
- What call?
- A video call.

929
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,660
Did he do that?

930
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,830
No. So Min, look ahead.

931
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,830
(No. So Min, look ahead.)

932
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,630
You should sit straight
in the monorail train.

933
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,760
Our viewers would want
to see your face, So Min.

934
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,100
- Our...
- Myung Jae, why did you...

935
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,070
tell Se Chan to go back?
Am I even on screen now?

936
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,430
Of course, you are.

937
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,230
- You look the biggest now.
- You're getting a close-up shot.

938
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,410
Shouldn't I sit in the back?

939
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,640
You look the biggest on screen.

940
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,610
Actually, he could've sat here.

941
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,710
Really?

942
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,620
Nice.

943
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,120
I thought it would be
too cramped here.

944
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,940
- You did?
- Yes.

945
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,180
- I need to talk to you later.
- You're with us.

946
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,180
- Why are you feeling lonely?
- Right. So Min, you're with us.

947
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,390
I will need to talk to you
when we get off.

948
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,180
We are all together here.

949
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,400
So Min, look far ahead.

950
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,290
- Right. Otherwise, you'll get sick.
- Look far ahead.

951
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,400
- This is nice.
- Looking at green is good for you.

952
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,630
It is nice.

953
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,070
I wonder where
Jae Suk and Suk Jin are.

954
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,030
- This is nice though.
- Hang on.

955
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,770
We walked only this much.
What's so nice about that?

956
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,110
Suk Jin! Everything
you say is fake.

957
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,350
- It's not fake.
- We walked only this much.

958
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,240
- Do you not like it then?
- Gosh.

959
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,440
This is my first hike
in about 20 years.

960
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,540
And we shouldn't be too slow.

961
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,740
We should hurry.

962
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,210
No, wait.

963
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,590
- Let's walk slowly.
- Why?

964
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,220
That's the mission. Don't run.

965
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,630
But it will take forever.

966
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,630
(Humming)

967
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,630
Singing

968
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,130
- Gosh.
- Why did you stop already?

969
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,140
I'm tired after only a few steps.

970
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,190
(What he just did was also fake.)

971
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,870
(Jae Suk runs first.)

972
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,030
Shoot.

973
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,410
(Humming)

974
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,840
(Groaning)

975
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,110
Go!

976
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,040
- Gosh, that prankster...
- Go!

977
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Why is he so energetic?

978
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,120
- Let's go up. Come on.
- Hey.

979
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,090
- Hey, come on.
- Just walk.

980
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,920
(He even forces
the production crew to run.)

981
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,160
My goodness.

982
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,520
- Hurry and come here.
- Hey.

983
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,750
You will get exhausted
at the beginning then.

984
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,360
I won't get exhausted.

985
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,990
How long will it take?

986
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,870
We should go up there.

987
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,200
This is nice though.

988
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,340
(Even the production crew
are getting exhausted.)

989
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,530
It's nice to have a walk
after a long time.

990
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,700
Hiking makes your legs strong.

991
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,240
You should take care of Suk Jin.

992
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,970
See? This is like
a short track race.

993
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,010
You should come together.

994
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,010
What?

995
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,510
Take care of Suk Jin.

996
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,210
- Are you all right? Are you okay?
- Yes.

997
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,130
Please take care of Suk Jin.

998
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,450
Look at you.

999
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,790
Why did you suggest this
when you can't even pull it off?

1000
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,560
Suk Jin, hurry!

1001
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,390
(Panting)

1002
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,390
Gosh, I'm tired.

1003
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,770
(Seok Sam faces a crisis
only 20 minutes into the hiking.)

1004
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,560
How can he be so energetic?

1005
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,140
My goodness.

1006
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,940
(He comes down to help Suk Jin.)

1007
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,440
Have some soft music ready.

1008
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,600
Put it on the turntable.

1009
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,850
Why?

1010
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,620
This should look touching.

1011
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,620
What do you mean?

1012
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,520
I'll go up the hill
carrying you on my back.

1013
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,620
- Hey.
- It will be touching.

1014
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,620
- You can't do that. I weigh 72kg.
- Suk Jin.

1015
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,190
- Let's make this touching.
- What are you talking about?

1016
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,850
We should make a good scene
that runs for at least five minutes.

1017
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,430
- Okay.
- Let's say you're exhausted.

1018
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,020
Have the music ready.

1019
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
I can't walk anymore.

1020
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,390
- I can't go.
- Suk Jin, we have to go.

1021
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,500
- No, I can't. I give up.
- Don't worry.

1022
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,160
I can't.

1023
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,940
(When he is about to give up,)

1024
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,140
(his colleague offers his back
to help him up.)

1025
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,770
Hey, I don't think you can do this.

1026
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,310
To you

1027
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,290
(When his eyes lose focus...)

1028
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,660
(and death stares him
in the face...)

1029
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,690
- You're strong.
- I know.

1030
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,850
This is enough.

1031
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,390
All right.

1032
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,390
Let's go to the car.

1033
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,500
No.

1034
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,600
Let's go to the car.

1035
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,270
(Now that he's got enough air time,
he finishes it up.)

1036
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,370
Suk Jin.

1037
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,190
- A car is coming.
- Let's hop in.

1038
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,310
- Can we hitchhike?
- Keep going.

1039
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,810
- Keep going.
- Let's hitchhike.

1040
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,540
Let's do it.

1041
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,640
(Passing by)

1042
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,100
- He passed us.
- Who was in the back?

1043
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,580
Gosh.

1044
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,750
Is he just leaving?

1045
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,020
You should hop in.

1046
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,480
(Jae Suk wants to keep walking.)

1047
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,520
Let's get a ride.

1048
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,560
- How far do we have to go?
- I think we can walk there.

1049
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,080
It's not that far.

1050
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,290
Then let's just go.

1051
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,430
You should get a ride.

1052
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,520
(He has no plan to get a ride.)

1053
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,230
(Sighing)

1054
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,890
You should get a ride.

1055
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,000
(Everyone is dying except
for the grasshopper.)

1056
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,270
Just get a ride.

1057
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,230
How far do we have to go?

1058
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,960
(How far do we have to go?)

1059
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,310
You should get a ride, sir.

1060
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,810
Because of that punk.

1061
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,730
(So the painful march begins.)

1062
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,980
Because of that prick.

1063
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,270
Don't you think...

1064
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,120
Suk Jin would ask for a ride?

1065
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,350
He'll be like, "Did we get enough?"

1066
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,910
- Right.
- He'd totally say that.

1067
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,620
- But Jae Suk would never allow it.
- Yes.

1068
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,250
He'll be like, "Suk Jin.
We can't do that."

1069
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,980
(They even got
how Jae Suk would react.)

1070
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,560
The air is fresh here.

1071
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,690
It's really pretty.

1072
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,890
Enjoy phytoncide.

1073
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,460
- Phytoncide.
- Phytoncide.

1074
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,190
Sweet.

1075
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,660
- It's sweet.
- It's delicious.

1076
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,160
So Min. Did you spend
a night in Yeosu?

1077
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,410
No, I went home that night.

1078
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,710
- When we went to Switzerland...
- Right.

1079
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,680
(Bringing back the memories
from Switzerland again)

1080
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,350
When we were in Yeosu...

1081
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,580
- Do you remember?
- To be honest,

1082
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,540
- I liked New Zealand better.
- Me too.

1083
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,460
- I prefer New Zealand too.
- New Zealand was...

1084
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,160
- nothing compared to that.
- It was the best in my life.

1085
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,390
I'm curious.
Did you all go to New Zealand?

1086
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

1087
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,460
It's nothing compared
to New Zealand.

1088
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,060
- The wind...
- Do you have your phone with you?

1089
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,520
- If we take a photo here,
- It'll be hard to walk up here.

1090
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,270
- it'll look like New Zealand.
- The trees.

1091
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,370
Like New Zealand?

1092
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,770
Myung Jae. Take a photo of us,

1093
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,560
and see if it looks like
New Zealand.

1094
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,910
So Min. Why don't you take
a photo of us?

1095
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,410
- Should I?
- Right. Take a photo of us.

1096
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,810
Do you want me to? I'll do that.

1097
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,480
I'll take a photo of you.

1098
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,440
I will do that. Just wait.

1099
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,710
Here.

1100
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,790
(Tilting)

1101
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,520
- Wait.
- No. You shouldn't be in the photo.

1102
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,620
- There's a ghost.
- So Min.

1103
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,190
(A photo by an uninvited guest)

1104
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,330
One, two, three.

1105
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,020
Forever our memory.

1106
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,770
We just made a memory in Cheorwon,
So Min.

1107
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,870
- The mountains are beautiful.
- Right?

1108
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,140
- The mountains in New Zealand...
- Hey!

1109
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,710
Listen to what New Zealand was like.

1110
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,460
It was just...

1111
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,500
(The train heads to the peak
with the story about New Zealand.)

1112
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,370
I think we're here.

1113
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,310
- It's going up.
- It's steep.

1114
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,870
Is it because we're near?

1115
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,350
This is it.

1116
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,580
Is it because it's dangerous?

1117
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,690
- We're almost there.
- It must be very high.

1118
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,960
Cheorwon.

1119
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,660
It'll be fun when we go down.

1120
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,960
This is what I'm talking about.

1121
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,430
- Are you scared?
- What?

1122
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,330
He's scared.

1123
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,060
- Are you scared?
- Really?

1124
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,770
- I was thinking...
- Hey. Look here.

1125
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,040
the train moving back
due to a broken brake.

1126
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,500
I was thinking about the same thing.

1127
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,140
- You're very imaginative.
- Right?

1128
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,710
Se Chan. Wasn't it this high
when we walked?

1129
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,600
- Yes, it was about this high.
- It was really high.

1130
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,440
Hey. Navis Swing was...

1131
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,270
(Talking about New Zealand again)

1132
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,980
- Seriously.
- That...

1133
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,190
- Don't even get me started.
- That was incomparable.

1134
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,160
- So Min. Navis Swing is...
- That was like 63 Building.

1135
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,480
- only for heroes.
- Yes.

1136
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,830
- Are we taking this again later?
- It's worth coming to Cheorwon.

1137
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,060
- Yes.
- Let's hop off.

1138
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,830
(Meanwhile, the walking team)

1139
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,370
(Panting)

1140
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,140
Don't worry about me. Go ahead.

1141
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,770
Give up on me.

1142
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,940
- Give up on me. Abandon me.
- Come on.

1143
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,440
- Leave me here.
- Let's go.

1144
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,370
- Leave me.
- Come with me.

1145
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,870
Leave me.

1146
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,750
Look.

1147
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,480
Director.

1148
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,250
Are you walking backwards?

1149
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,350
The audio director.

1150
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,080
- If you do that, what would I do?
- She's walking backward.

1151
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,620
You don't have to keep the mask on.

1152
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
Hey. How heavy is that?

1153
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,250
(Hey. How heavy is that?)

1154
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,770
I'm an ordinary man.

1155
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,660
He's the weird one.

1156
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,770
(Panting)

1157
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,960
Try walking backwards.
It's a lot better.

1158
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,560
This is good exercise.

1159
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,980
(The steep hill continues.)

1160
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,230
It's steep.

1161
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,910
("Steep" by Ji Suk Jin)

1162
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,350
Why are you so steep?

1163
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,140
- Suk Jin. Come on.
- Steep.

1164
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,980
How come...

1165
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,160
you never compromise with the world?

1166
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,790
Hurry up.

1167
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,580
No. I know...

1168
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,020
how to take care of my mind.

1169
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,960
I'm not tired. Okay.

1170
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,770
I'm not tired.

1171
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,790
I hike every morning.

1172
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,440
- This isn't enough to exhaust me.
- Hurry up.

1173
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,500
Mind control.

1174
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,310
Yes, I can control my mind.

1175
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,870
(Suk Jin brainwashes himself
to keep going.)

1176
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,600
The one I took was an easy course.

1177
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,750
How far does this go?

1178
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,540
(How far does this go?)

1179
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,580
Hyung In!

1180
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,310
Why are you holding us back?

1181
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,390
From the start. Why?

1182
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,390
Hey! Have you reached this age?

1183
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,080
- Suk Jin's starting to get mad.
- Hey.

1184
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,600
She's acting like
she didn't hear us.

1185
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,830
- She's pretending not to hear us.
- Hey! Give us a hint.

1186
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,100
- Look at her back.
- You should've given us a hint!

1187
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,790
You should've sneaked up...

1188
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,060
- and told me to stop...
- That's funny.

1189
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,370
(Stop...)

1190
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,500
Hurry up.

1191
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,680
(Panting)

1192
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,710
It's definitely a go next time.

1193
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,410
It's a go no matter what.

1194
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,680
I'm telling you now.

1195
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,810
- I'll do the opposite.
- I'm only going to say go.

1196
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,350
Haha. Is it awesome?

1197
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,640
(Team Monorail reached
the observatory.)

1198
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,810
- Is it awesome?
- This is unbelievable.

1199
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,710
It's like a postcard.

1200
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,430
(Exclaiming)

1201
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,620
It's a hot place.

1202
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,870
Are you sure this is Korea?

1203
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,960
It's an observatory.

1204
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,290
It's pretty.

1205
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,600
(You can only see golden
Cheorwon plain...)

1206
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,440
It's worth posting on social media.

1207
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,980
It's beautiful.

1208
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,000
(On top of Mount Soi.)

1209
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,210
This is amazing.

1210
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,500
Can you believe it?

1211
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,850
It's pretty. The sky is perfect.

1212
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,210
It's wonderful.

1213
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,910
I didn't know how beautiful
Cheorwon was.

1214
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,250
(Everyone exclaims at the view.)

1215
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,350
It's marvelous.

1216
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,390
(Taking a selfie)

1217
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,620
It's beautiful.

1218
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,520
I think I've seen a drawing
like this before.

1219
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,930
- It's amazing.
- I think I've seen it.

1220
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,790
- Jae Suk.
- You're here.

1221
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,690
It's magnificent.

1222
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,500
(Speechless)

1223
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,270
- It's beautiful.
- Yes.

1224
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,540
It's great.

1225
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,040
This is really...

1226
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,810
- Should I step up here?
- No, it's okay.

1227
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,870
Will you move?

1228
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,910
(Getting in the way)

1229
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,640
It was perfect.
Then some guy came in.

1230
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,850
Excuse me.

1231
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,620
- Some guy barged in.
- Jae Suk.

1232
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,020
(Some guy barges in
and ruins the trip.)

1233
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,080
- Jae Suk.
- Hey.

1234
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,520
You pricks.

1235
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,080
It's wonderful.

1236
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,120
Having fun?

1237
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,480
- The audio team's in the back.
- Hey.

1238
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,160
Having fun?

1239
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,850
Okay. One more time.

1240
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,020
- Seriously.
- Oh, come on.

1241
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,190
- Get out of there.
- No.

1242
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,140
(Even though he's exhausted,
he still wants to get in the photo.)

1243
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,660
- It's amazing.
- I feel like I'm on a trip.

1244
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,910
- Hey.
- By the way...

1245
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,500
You should try walking.
It's worth it.

1246
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,180
- It's worth it?
- Yes.

1247
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,710
"You should try walking.
It's worth it."

1248
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,520
Sir.

1249
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,770
- It's really nice.
- It's beautiful.

1250
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,250
It's very nice.

1251
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,080
- It's nice.
- It really is.

1252
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,350
Suk Jin. Your wife...

1253
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,390
didn't go to the US.
You should bring her here.

1254
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,830
- I should bring her here.
- Yes. It's only an hour and a half.

1255
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,560
- Her trip to the US is canceled.
- Yes.

1256
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,730
- It takes 11 hours to the US.
- Yes.

1257
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,730
This is only an hour
and a half away.

1258
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,540
Are we playing a game here again?

1259
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,500
It's going to be a simple game.

1260
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,160
I'm telling you now
my answer is a go.

1261
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,000
- What?
- My answer is a go.

1262
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,480
- Go?
- Because...

1263
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,210
I've been saying go.
What if I change it now,

1264
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,640
and it turns out Go was
the best option?

1265
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,750
Are you going to take responsibility
for my life?

1266
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,540
- Why should I?
- Are you?

1267
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,910
- Why are you betting your life...
- Suk Jin.

1268
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,350
- on go?
- Try it at least three times.

1269
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,390
Right? Try it at least three times.

1270
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,690
It has to be a go now.
I have no other choice.

1271
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,980
- Okay.
- This is a simple mission.

1272
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,230
It's going to get difficult now.

1273
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,690
I'm going to give you cards.

1274
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,830
Draw two cards each.

1275
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,270
Three people with the highest sum
will get the hint.

1276
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,830
(You'll draw 2 cards, and 3 people
with highest sum will get a hint.)

1277
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,960
- Nice.
- That's nice.

1278
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,410
Give them to me.

1279
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,660
(Getting up)

1280
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,710
You see...

1281
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,500
I'll mix them up.

1282
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,810
Do you like playing cards?

1283
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,640
- Do you play cards often?
- Yes.

1284
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,940
He couldn't hold back
after seeing the cards.

1285
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,250
- The cards...
- When I was in the army...

1286
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,690
You're very good.

1287
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,080
- You're good.
- When I was in the army...

1288
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,190
- You're good.
- He's the son of Jeongseon.

1289
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,850
- Were you a dealer?
- Yes.

1290
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,060
I'm the son of Jeongseon.

1291
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,790
- Did you take lessons?
- Yes.

1292
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,690
- The son of Jeongseon.
- His eyes shone after seeing them.

1293
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,330
- I'm the son of Jeongseon.
- When he saw the cards...

1294
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,100
I'll distribute them.

1295
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,000
Distribute them randomly.

1296
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,310
- When you do this,
- Sit there.

1297
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,230
- the bottom cards are the best.
- He's looking at them.

1298
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,080
You can't cheat.

1299
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,180
- What are you doing?
- I wasn't cheating.

1300
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,250
- Who cheats like that?
- Jae Suk.

1301
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,640
- You should've done it in secret.
- Right.

1302
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,480
- Who cheats like that?
- I'm sorry.

1303
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,690
(Pretending to mix them up)

1304
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,250
I'm getting nervous.

1305
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,850
I'll give you one each.

1306
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,690
- Like this?
- Yes.

1307
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,830
Don't we get to choose?

1308
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,060
Why don't we open one?

1309
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,100
- What?
- I'll open mine.

1310
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,520
Why don't we put it up
on our foreheads and exchange?

1311
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,500
- Shall we?
- On the forehead?

1312
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,560
Now...

1313
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,770
- We'll pick one now.
- Let's pick one.

1314
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,210
- Pick one.
- Okay.

1315
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,310
(They'll pick the second card.)

1316
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:32,680
I wonder what it is.

1317
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,000
(They'll pick the second card.)

1318
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,620
In the last month,

1319
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,790
Suk Jin never...

1320
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,350
- looked so...
- He's so excited.

1321
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,410
I'm the son of Jeongseon.

1322
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,580
I think I got it.

1323
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,960
You did? Look at it nicely
if you want to be on TV.

1324
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,250
- It's me.
- Se Chan. It's too low.

1325
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,160
- Let's reveal one each.
- Yes.

1326
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,960
One.

1327
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,020
Two.

1328
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,160
(Revealing the first card)

1329
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,460
- Three.
- Four.

1330
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,830
Six.

1331
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,040
- Two.
- Three.

1332
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,770
- Three.
- Two.

1333
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:04,770
Four size. It's only nine.

1334
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,680
- Two.
- I can't believe I got a two.

1335
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,810
- Mine isn't that bad.
- This is terrible.

1336
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,410
- It's nice.
- You and I will get the hint.

1337
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,480
- You and me.
- Next.

1338
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,910
Let's reveal the next card
one by one.

1339
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:14,940
Starting with Haha.

1340
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,910
One, two, three.

1341
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,390
- Six.
- That's terrible.

1342
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,250
- Se Chan.
- One, two, three.

1343
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,120
- Eight.
- Eight.

1344
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,230
- Eight.
- It's out.

1345
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,830
- So Min.
- One, two, three. It's 11.

1346
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,390
- Eleven.
- You are number one so far.

1347
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,000
(So Min: 11)

1348
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,140
Suk Jin.

1349
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,890
It's 14.

1350
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:33,940
- Ji Hyo.
- It's ten.

1351
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,040
It's ten.

1352
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,100
- Jong Kook.
- It's ten.

1353
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,080
Jong Kook.

1354
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,540
Oh, yes.

1355
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,250
- It's 19.
- Gosh,

1356
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,250
it's a king card.

1357
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,370
(Jong Kook: 19)

1358
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,620
(Jong Kook ranks 1st.)

1359
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,190
(Jae Suk will be in the top 3
if his total is 11 or higher.)

1360
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,250
It's a king card.

1361
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,080
- A king card.
- It's ten.

1362
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,580
- You and me.
- We are picking the top three.

1363
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,020
- The top 3.
- My total is 11.

1364
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:01,270
So Min, Jong Kook, and Suk Jin
will listen to a hint.

1365
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:03,120
Choose if you want a hint
for Go or Stop.

1366
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,500
Go all the way.

1367
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,000
I chose Go all along.

1368
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,100
Thank goodness.
A hint will help me a lot.

1369
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,080
I will listen to a hint for Stop.

1370
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,140
I will listen to a hint for Go.
A hint for Go.

1371
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,180
(Suk Jin chooses a hint for Go.)

1372
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,410
Go all the way.

1373
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,680
You want to make sure your hand is
on the T grip at all times.

1374
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,980
Good, wide paddle grip.

1375
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,910
And your feet are wedged
at all times.

1376
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,790
If you wedge your feet
and paddle aggressively,

1377
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,310
you will tend to stay in the boat.

1378
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,460
- Can I listen to it again?
- No.

1379
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,620
Gosh.

1380
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:32,230
- Was it a hint for Stop?
- I would know if I listen again.

1381
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,660
I will choose a hint for Go
since he chose a hint for Stop.

1382
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,430
- It was a hint for Go.
- His facial expression... Really?

1383
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,390
- Yes. You have an advantage.
- A hint for Stop.

1384
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,640
I will listen to a hint for Stop.
Hold on.

1385
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:51,850
(Listening to a hint for Stop
for the 2nd course)

1386
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,560
- Is that it?
- Yes.

1387
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:03,660
Did you listen to a hint
for Go or Stop?

1388
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,330
- A hint for Stop.
- Stop.

1389
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,500
- What was it for again?
- For Stop.

1390
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:14,830
(Listening to a hint for Stop
for the 2nd course)

1391
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:18,000
What's this sound?

1392
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,710
Did you listen to a hint
for Go or Stop?

1393
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,750
Stop.

1394
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,040
- It was a hint for Stop, right?
- Yes.

1395
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,680
- I will choose Go.
- Go.

1396
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,080
We should choose Go this time
because we had two Stops.

1397
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,710
Haha, please go first and choose.

1398
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,850
(Haha goes to choose
either Go or Stop.)

1399
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,960
You should let me hear it.

1400
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,060
- It's so confusing. The sound...
- Suk Jin, was it a hint for Go?

1401
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,750
- Yes.
- I have no idea.

1402
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,120
So Min, you have no idea, right?

1403
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,270
I have no idea. The sound...

1404
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,370
It was... But it didn't sound good.

1405
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,790
I was so flustered.

1406
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,960
I was flustered too.
I wanted to listen to it again.

1407
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,230
Were you flustered too?

1408
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,770
It hit me so fast.

1409
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,000
I didn't understand anything.

1410
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,640
Maybe there isn't a twist.
Maybe choosing Stop is always good.

1411
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,640
Is it time to choose Go?
We had two Stops earlier.

1412
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,040
(Confused)

1413
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,120
I chose one.

1414
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,160
(So Min was torn
after hearing a hint for Stop.)

1415
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:15,830
I am nervous, but...

1416
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,270
It was the sound of wind.

1417
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,770
It was the sound of strong wind.

1418
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:21,960
(Jong Kook guessed it to be
the sound of wind too.)

1419
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,210
What will you choose?

1420
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,350
What?

1421
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,410
- I will choose Go.
- Really?

1422
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,520
- I bet Suk Jin will choose Stop.
- I know.

1423
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,890
Suk Jin will choose Stop
no matter what.

1424
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,980
Why would I do that?
I would choose Go.

1425
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,080
He chose Go.

1426
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,480
Think about it.

1427
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,430
(Jae Suk chose Go
3 times in a row.)

1428
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:43,430
Go.

1429
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,330
- I chose Go.
- Did you choose Go again?

1430
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,350
I will choose Stop.

1431
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:48,020
- Go.
- Did you choose Go?

1432
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,790
- Everyone chose either Go or Stop.
- It was the sound of the wind.

1433
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,290
I will give you the board
for the second course.

1434
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,540
- This is driving me crazy.
- This is bad. What did you choose?

1435
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,100
- Did you choose Stop?
- I chose Go.

1436
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,370
- Then you will be fine.
- Those who chose Go are...

1437
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:01,480
Haha, Se Chan, Jae Suk,
and Suk Jin.

1438
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,140
- That's unlucky. This is bad.
- Stop.

1439
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,250
- This is a disaster.
- This is a disaster.

1440
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,940
No, I am sure Go is a better choice.

1441
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,980
Those who chose Stop are
Ji Hyo, So Min, and Jong Kook.

1442
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,890
- I...
- Team Go, come here.

1443
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,460
- I chose Stop.
- He sounded like a pilot.

1444
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,790
- Reveal Go first.
- Go.

1445
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,460
(Go gets revealed first.)

1446
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:18,890
Go.

1447
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,830
(Stop was a better option 2 times.
How about now?)

1448
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,100
I bet Go is an easy one.

1449
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,690
Go.

1450
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,370
(2nd course)

1451
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:27,540
(Go: Ride a rubber boat.)

1452
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,810
- "Ride a rubber boat."
- What does that mean?

1453
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,370
(A rubber boat?)

1454
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:35,180
You will go rafting at Hantan River.

1455
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,180
(Rafting at Hantan River)

1456
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,370
- Thank goodness.
- We will get wet. We will fall.

1457
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:45,160
(Rafting will be thrilling
in the strong current.)

1458
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,330
- Thank goodness. I am glad.
- We will get wet. We will fall.

1459
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,690
We dodged the bullet.

1460
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,790
- Hey.
- We dodged the bullet.

1461
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:52,120
- Rafting?
- For goodness' sake.

1462
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,930
- Go was a bad choice twice,
- Hyung In.

1463
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,730
- so it should be a good choice now.
- Stop it already.

1464
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,660
- Three Stops are ridiculous.
- Stop it already.

1465
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,140
- What was the English?
- It was the instructions.

1466
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,140
- The instructions of paddling.
- What's Stop?

1467
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,140
(Suk Jin heard a hint for Go.)

1468
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,270
You are paddling a boat today.

1469
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,910
You want to make sure your hands
cover the t-grip at all times.

1470
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:11,210
Good, wide paddle grip.

1471
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,210
And your feet are wedged
at all times.

1472
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,250
- The instructions of paddling.
- What's Stop?

1473
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,350
- What's Stop?
- What's Stop?

1474
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,580
Stop changing into another outfit.
Enjoy a relaxed motorboat ride.

1475
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,730
- A motorboat.
- A motorboat is a good idea.

1476
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,060
Three Stops are ridiculous.

1477
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,250
- Why isn't there a twist?
- That's insane.

1478
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,600
(They can enjoy a motorboat ride
as they look at the view.)

1479
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,270
(Jong Kook heard the hint for Stop.)

1480
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:31,730
(It was the sound of calm waters.)

1481
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:35,060
Three Stops are ridiculous.
Why isn't there a twist?

1482
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,730
Why isn't there a twist?

1483
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,640
- There should be a twist.
- I told you not to do that.

1484
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,310
Stop it already.

1485
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,440
Jae Suk,
you should choose differently.

1486
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,180
You should choose differently.

1487
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,810
- Stop being stubborn.
- Jae Suk.

1488
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,540
- Seriously.
- For goodness' sake.

1489
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,350
Jae Suk and Suk Jin
are so bad at choosing.

1490
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,460
I thought it was the zip line.

1491
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,020
- This is ridiculous.
- What if...

1492
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,290
What if we choose Stop at the end...

1493
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,000
only to have everyone go home
except for us?

1494
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:02,770
- Team Stop might have to stay.
- Stop.

1495
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,390
- That would be the worst.
- That might happen.

1496
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,060
- That would be the worst.
- "Visit the dam before going home."

1497
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:11,040
The members have been divided
into rafting and a motorboat ride.

1498
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,370
- This is fun.
- Let's move on.

1499
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,850
- For goodness' sake.
- This is why we brought underwear.

1500
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,180
Not giving a twist is fun.

1501
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,750
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1502
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,120
(Suk Jin's original seat)

1503
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,790
- Why did you sit over there?
- I will tell you.

1504
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,520
- I will tell you.
- Just let it go.

1505
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,100
- Is it because of the sun?
- Just let it go.

1506
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,600
- It's because of the sun.
- Hey.

1507
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,790
- He moved because of the sun.
- That was the reason.

1508
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,210
- Unbelievable.
- He is the worst.

1509
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,940
- Also,
- He is the worst.

1510
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,830
he doesn't think
it will be a long ride.

1511
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,870
- My goodness.
- That's why he sat here.

1512
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,710
My goodness. So Min.

1513
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:51,080
- Unbelievable.
- Suk Jin didn't take that seat.

1514
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,120
Why not?

1515
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,680
- The sunlight.
- I see.

1516
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,080
I hope his side gets the sun
as soon as we hit the road.

1517
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,410
I am sure
that side will get the sun.

1518
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,250
Suk Jin is so funny.

1519
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,620
It's cool.
The weather is so hot today.

1520
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,790
He said, "It's cool."

1521
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:07,890
We talked about watching
the FIFA World Cup on December 24th.

1522
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,020
- No.
- What do you think?

1523
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,160
No. I want to watch it
with my family.

1524
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,660
I don't want to watch it with you.

1525
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,060
I will buy you dinner.

1526
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,330
Will there be a camera?

1527
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:15,710
- No.
- Then I will go.

1528
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:16,830
Why would there be a camera?

1529
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,330
Isn't it a shoot
for "Ji Suk Jin World?"

1530
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,080
I wouldn't do that.

1531
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,270
- Actually, that's a good idea.
- You might do that.

1532
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,850
Is it for "Ji Suk Jin World?"

1533
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,210
- No.
- You might do that.

1534
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,480
- "Ji Suk Jin World."
- It isn't for my channel.

1535
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,890
It will take about 20 minutes
to get there.

1536
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,850
- You can relax during the ride.
- It's pretty long.

1537
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,480
Okay. Is there a game?

1538
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,890
- No.
- Is it really a therapeutic trip?

1539
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,020
Can we relax?
This is a therapeutic trip.

1540
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,020
- You can talk among yourselves.
- That's good.

1541
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,660
This would be therapeutic
for Team Stop.

1542
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,270
Three consecutive Stops
make no sense.

1543
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:43,620
This isn't therapeutic at all
for Team Go.

1544
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,000
- It's so nice.
- Did you choose Go?

1545
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,160
How many more times
are we choosing Go or Stop? Twice?

1546
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,560
You will choose once for a meal.
Then one more choice remains.

1547
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,640
- Twice more.
- Really?

1548
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,600
- Seriously.
- It's about time it's Go.

1549
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,270
- But...
- Seriously, Go...

1550
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,210
- It can't be Stop all the time.
- I know.

1551
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,210
Those who chose Go all along
can't switch to Stop now.

1552
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,580
- I know. It's impossible.
- I will keep choosing Go.

1553
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,390
I will choose Stop the next time.

1554
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,850
- I will choose Go.
- I can't do this anymore.

1555
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,660
What's that saying?
"Push forward no matter the result."

1556
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,350
- Right. I would be so upset.
- Choose Go.

1557
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,520
Go.

1558
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,250
(Where are you?)

1559
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,230
- You are thorough.
- He heard the song.

1560
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,960
You are thorough.

1561
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,060
- He heard the song.
- "Confession."

1562
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:25,180
(He gives an encore performance
as he wrinkles up his face.)

1563
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,370
- The title sounds like "Choose Go."
- "Confession."

1564
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,350
You are thorough.

1565
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,910
Let's make a two-line poem.

1566
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,870
If we travel a bit more,
we will reach North Korea.

1567
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,020
Suk Jin, you should go.

1568
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:36,850
- You should go.
- Hey.

1569
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:39,390
- Is that for Go or Stop?
- Suk Jin.

1570
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,430
- You should go.
- Go.

1571
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,730
- Go.
- Defect from North Korea.

1572
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:43,750
Defect from North Korea.

1573
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,850
Let's go.

1574
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:46,960
I never said I will go there.

1575
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,370
Haha, if you defect from a country,

1576
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,770
- it means you escape.
- Is it "Escape from South Korea?"

1577
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,770
- What is it then?
- "Defect to North Korea."

1578
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,160
- For goodness' sake.
- "Escape from South Korea?"

1579
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,370
You are so ignorant.

1580
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,810
- I said it.
- This is driving me crazy.

1581
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,540
Why did you suddenly bring that up?

1582
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,580
The North and South used to be one.

1583
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,410
Make an acrostic poem
with the syllables of Cheorwon.

1584
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,540
- Do that.
- C.

1585
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,190
Come on and get more mature.

1586
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:11,350
- W.
- Won Cheol.

1587
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,160
- Won Cheol?
- Suk Jin.

1588
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,290
It's my friend's name.

1589
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:15,620
- Good job.
- Come on, Suk Jin.

1590
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,160
- Jae Suk. C.
- Give me the first letters.

1591
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,600
- Go ahead.
- Chul Soo.

1592
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,960
- Wo.
- Won Chul went somewhere, right?

1593
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,770
- You focused on the tone.
- You focused on the tone.

1594
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:24,940
Seriously.

1595
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,140
- Se Chan.
- Are you North Korean?

1596
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,460
Since we are close to North Korea,

1597
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,830
I used that accent.

1598
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,310
- C.
- Haha. C.

1599
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,980
Chul Sook.

1600
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,580
- You are acting.
- W.

1601
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:37,940
Everyone is using a funny tone.

1602
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,940
- W.
- W.

1603
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,350
- Chul Sook.
- W.

1604
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,850
Won Chul is here.

1605
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:43,890
C.

1606
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,850
Keep going and you will reach it.

1607
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,350
It's "Keep."

1608
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,850
- It's okay.
- You can't do that.

1609
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,020
W, to Wonju.

1610
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,060
Suk Jin, come on.

1611
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,160
- From Cheorwon to Wonju,
- You can't do that.

1612
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,160
- the distance isn't long.
- Ji Hyo.

1613
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,830
- Yes.
- Give us an acrostic poem. C.

1614
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,160
Childish behaviors
won't get you anywhere.

1615
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,290
- Good.
- W.

1616
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,270
Wimp.

1617
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,710
(It comes out of nowhere.)

1618
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,910
- That was sudden.
- Ji Hyo.

1619
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,310
Ji Hyo.

1620
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,910
- That was sudden.
- It was the Gen Zers' style.

1621
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,940
It was so cold
that I almost teared up.

1622
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,940
- It was scary.
- It was so cold.

1623
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,020
She put her emotions into it.

1624
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,290
She suddenly became emotional.

1625
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,850
She suddenly became emotional.

1626
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,460
Jong Kook. C.

1627
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,830
Childish one.

1628
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,190
- O.
- One, two, one, two.

1629
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,000
- One, two.
- One, two, one, two.

1630
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,560
(Sudden attack)

1631
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,190
- You prepared it.
- You got me surprised.

1632
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,390
You prepared it.

1633
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:34,600
- "One, two, one, two."
- That was nice.

1634
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,000
- Isn't it nice?
- It's good.

1635
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,600
- One, two, punch.
- That was nice.

1636
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,270
- "Childish one" was...
- "One, two, one, two."

1637
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,910
It's under a shadow here now.

1638
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,640
- What did you say?
- It's under a shadow now.

1639
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,680
- S.
- What?

1640
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,980
So many restaurants here
have delicious food.

1641
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,980
- D.
- Definitely going to the one...

1642
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,690
we always visited.

1643
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,190
What was that?

1644
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,290
He...

1645
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,460
- It's...
- Can you do it then?

1646
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,060
It was like a video letter.

1647
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,060
S.

1648
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,560
Say what you did
the day before yesterday.

1649
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,160
- D.
- Don't stay at home all the time.

1650
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,160
(Confused)

1651
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,310
What's with that North Korean
accent?

1652
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,500
- You try it then.
- Is it because we're close to it?

1653
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,330
- Yes.
- Just bring it on.

1654
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:13,710
- S.
- He said, "Bring it on."

1655
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,910
Such an old...

1656
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,480
- D.
- Dude.

1657
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,580
(Such an old...)

1658
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,540
(Such an old dude)

1659
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,690
- Well done.
- I was going to say that too.

1660
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:24,710
- It's over.
- I was going to say that too.

1661
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,810
She kept looking at me.

1662
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,460
- "Such an old..."
- She wanted me to ask her.

1663
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,350
It was the best one.

1664
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:31,890
It's nice.

1665
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,190
Let's see how you guys do it.

1666
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,270
It's funny.

1667
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:37,600
Those who chose rafting
should get off.

1668
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,890
- See you.
- See you.

1669
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:39,960
- You got this.
- Okay.

1670
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,830
- Okay.
- See you later.

1671
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:42,830
Good luck.

1672
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,000
I should wear a cap.

1673
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,810
Give us some suncream at least.

1674
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,890
Gosh, it's so pretty.

1675
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:51,490
Look how clean the water is.
That's true.

1676
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,060
Look how pretty it is.

1677
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,390
Isn't it so pretty?

1678
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:57,390
(The view near the river is as
refreshing the wide field.)

1679
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:58,700
It's cool.

1680
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,060
(The view near the river is as
refreshing the wide field.)

1681
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,470
- I guess he likes water.
- That's unusual for him...

1682
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:03,830
to say it's pretty
after seeing something like this.

1683
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:06,060
- I always liked stuff like this.
- You like water.

1684
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,100
More than trees.

1685
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,310
Gosh, my father would love
this kind of place.

1686
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,200
I just like seeing pretty things.

1687
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,520
Nice.

1688
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,140
(Screaming)

1689
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,750
(Peekaboo)

1690
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,850
(Screaming)

1691
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,250
Hey, what are you doing?

1692
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:28,200
(They were so surprised that they
scream and walk in weird ways.)

1693
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,600
- Why?
- What is it?

1694
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,890
What is it?

1695
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:32,470
It's a cute frog.

1696
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,200
What was it?

1697
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,870
- A frog.
- It's so big.

1698
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,200
- It's a frog.
- It was so big.

1699
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,160
No, it wasn't. It was a baby.

1700
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,040
- I almost stepped on it. Saw it?
- It was a baby.

1701
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,410
I didn't see it.

1702
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:43,500
It was a baby.

1703
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,640
It came here.

1704
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,870
Something...

1705
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:50,020
- It went between So Min's legs.
- passed by me, which surprised me.

1706
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,640
I almost stepped on it.

1707
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:55,290
Hey, your nickname is Frog.
You can't be afraid of frogs.

1708
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:57,680
It was this big.

1709
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,060
That's not big.

1710
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,120
(People might think
they saw a venomous snake.)

1711
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,350
I don't think we'll get wet.

1712
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,330
Fortunately, we won't get wet.

1713
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:06,560
Nice.

1714
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,060
It's pretty.

1715
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,040
"A ship to 100 million years ago?"

1716
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,470
Did this exist
100 million years ago?

1717
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:14,770
No. It means the river
was formed 100 million years ago.

1718
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,600
- You mean the waterway?
- I guess so.

1719
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,770
- Let's get on.
- Let's get on.

1720
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:19,970
Let's board.

1721
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:21,950
It's nice.

1722
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,870
I guess this seat
is for the instructor.

1723
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,040
I won't get seasick, right?

1724
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,290
It's pretty.

1725
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:27,680
No scary things, right?

1726
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,890
It's nice.

1727
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:31,060
How can the rocks look like that?

1728
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,220
- Don't you agree?
- Right?

1729
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,850
It looks like it's carved.

1730
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,430
Let's look over there
and make a V sign.

1731
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,000
Nature is so...

1732
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,560
(Nature makes Jong Kook
sentimental like a girl.)

1733
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,240
We're so unlucky.

1734
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,140
Why do we have to go rafting
all of a sudden?

1735
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,560
(As known as scaredy-cat quartet)

1736
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,180
Four scaredy-cats are doing it.

1737
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,180
(As known as scaredy-cat quartet)

1738
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,270
- The best scaredy-cats.
- But...

1739
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:53,500
Jae Suk looks quite brave
when he's with us.

1740
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,950
He also shakes once it starts.

1741
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,390
(A rafting challenge of the guys
who are equally cowardly)

1742
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,120
Gosh, doing rafting here...

1743
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,180
I've never done it in my life.

1744
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,750
(A rubber boat will quickly pass
by the narrow stream.)

1745
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,830
Why do I want to fart
when I'm nervous these days?

1746
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,600
It's because you're old now.

1747
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,890
It's cold as well.

1748
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,470
Oh, gosh.

1749
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,770
(The scaredy-cat quartet will never
pay to do this!)

1750
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,560
How come we got to do this?

1751
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,700
You should pull it. Or you'll die.

1752
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:22,100
Haha, a rock or water plant
can go into the hole here.

1753
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:26,140
That's not it. The boat can flip
over and you'll bump into the rock.

1754
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,950
Your teeth will be gone.

1755
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,470
Here's the instructor
who will explain rafting to you.

1756
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,290
- How come...
- Hello.

1757
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:33,290
- four cowards came here?
- Hello.

1758
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:35,220
Hello.

1759
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,160
- You should start rafting now.
- Okay.

1760
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,250
- Before we begin,
- Yes.

1761
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,700
- I'll teach you how to use...
- Okay.

1762
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,060
foot loops.

1763
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,870
- What? Foot loops?
- Yes.

1764
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,290
Then we'll go down to the river
immediately and take the boat.

1765
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,560
- Okay.
- For your information,

1766
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,240
I don't know if you know it,
but we didn't volunteer to do this.

1767
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,850
We picked something
and they made us do this.

1768
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,640
- We don't actually...
- Please make it safe.

1769
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,410
- enjoy rafting very much.
- I see.

1770
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,370
There must be advanced,
intermediate, and beginner courses.

1771
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,390
- It should be for beginners.
- Depending on the difficulty.

1772
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:06,680
- We'd like a beginner course.
- A beginner course.

1773
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,580
Our reactions will be big enough
even if it's a beginner course.

1774
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,520
Four scaredy-cats have gathered.

59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,139
Were you not going to do this...

1775
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,890
if we had all stopped?

1776
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:15,890
Yes.

1777
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,500
- I see.
- Do you think it would've happened?

1778
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,600
- I have no words to say.
- Okay. What should we do, sir?

1779
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,790
Come here.

1780
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,200
Which spot is scary?

1781
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,140
- I'll sit in the back.
- Which one is the scariest spot?

1782
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,160
It's more fun in the front.

1783
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,200
- No, then...
- I'll sit in the back.

1784
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,580
- I'll sit in the back.
- No.

1785
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:32,080
- Put your hand here.
- That's where you sit?

1786
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,750
Put your foot into the foot loop
and twist your legs.

1787
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,310
It might slip off.

1788
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,370
It's going to be safe. Don't worry.

1789
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,120
- I got it.
- Please take care of us.

1790
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:41,250
Okay. Did you get it?

1791
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,890
- Yes. We got it.
- Yes. We'll listen to you.

1792
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,120
- Let's move to the river.
- Okay.

1793
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,890
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

1794
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,220
Yes, sir.

1795
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,330
- Yes.
- Why did I choose this?

1796
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:50,850
Stand in two rows.

1797
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:51,970
Okay.

1798
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:55,270
We're such cowards. We think he'll
give us a fun ride if we behave.

1799
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,740
"Yes, sir." We said it so nicely.

1800
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,870
(Scaredy-cats who listen well
when they're scared)

1801
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:00,770
It's cold as well.

1802
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:02,200
Oh, gosh.

1803
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:05,000
- The wind is also cold.
- Why is the stream strong there?

1804
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,310
- All of a sudden.
- Oh, gosh.

1805
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:07,770
Do we have to bring it down there?

1806
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,140
Does it hurt?

1807
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:13,250
(Laughing)

1808
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,490
- He has a horrible look.
- But it's so...

1809
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:17,660
- Because he's scared.
- I'm a little scared.

1810
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,120
- Do you want to see your mom?
- I'll sit in the front.

1811
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,500
Shall we go down?

1812
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,600
- Stand in groups of two.
- Okay.

1813
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,700
Yes. 1, 2.

1814
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,890
- Do you see the handle?
- Yes.

1815
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:26,890
- Here?
- Yes.

1816
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:29,270
Hold the handle and put it up.

1817
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,930
- It's heavy.
- Oh, my.

1818
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,470
- One, two.
- Let's go in.

1819
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:35,410
- One, two.
- My gosh.

1820
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,240
- Please take good care of us.
- I've never done rafting.

1821
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,100
Seriously, why am I rafting
all of a sudden?

1822
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,370
Please push the boat.

1823
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:41,640
Should we push it?

1824
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,640
We got to do this
because we chose Go?

1825
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,160
It seems fun though.
When will we ever get to do this?

1826
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:50,790
Suk Jin, why do you...

1827
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,990
- I'm assuring myself.
- It's because he's scared.

1828
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:55,060
- That's why he talks to himself.
- Why are you talking to yourself?

1829
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,060
- I'm assuring myself.
- It's because he's scared.

1830
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,660
It looks very fun.

1831
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,200
Honestly, as men,

1832
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,060
we should enjoy this
more than the small boat.

1833
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,160
Who will get on it first?

1834
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,470
- Should I go first?
- Those sitting in the front first.

1835
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,740
- Those sitting in the front first?
- Sit in the front.

1836
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:07,560
- Please get on.
- Let me get on the boat.

1837
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,200
(Jae Suk gets on the boat while
Seok Sam is hypnotizing himself.)

1838
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,410
- Gosh, this is...
- I'm scared.

1839
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,770
Which one is the front
and which one is the back?

1840
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:18,410
- Should I go further?
- Towards the front.

1841
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:19,410
- Here?
- More?

1842
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,790
Like this. Yes.

1843
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,560
- Like this. Yes. It's fine.
- Like this?

1844
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,020
You look cool.

1845
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,200
- Those who will row with us.
- We need them to go with us.

1846
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,290
(The staff members got on as they
need a certain number of people.)

1847
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,000
Gosh, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

1848
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,060
I've never done this.

1849
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,120
I can't believe I got to do this.

1850
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,390
- Hey.
- It's done. Oh, my gosh.

1851
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,390
- In the back, it's too...
- Be careful.

1852
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:38,700
Are you wearing this?

1853
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,600
- It's kind of cool though.
- It's...

1854
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,930
How do I hold it? Like this?

1855
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,270
Gosh.

1856
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,200
- It's fun.
- Do you see the "T" here?

1857
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,250
- Yes.
- Put your thumb on it...

1858
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,870
- and hold it again.
- Like this?

1859
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:51,750
Yes. And keep your arms the width
of your shoulders apart.

1860
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,950
(Nervous)

1861
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:56,310
I'll say "Both sides, front, one"
when I want to go forward.

1862
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,680
When I say "one," make one long,
powerful stroke.

1863
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,080
- Do you get it?
- Yes.

1864
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,720
Let's practice. Let's go forward.
Both sides, front, one.

1865
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,270
- One.
- One.

1866
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:07,100
- Two.
- Two.

1867
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,040
- One.
- One.

1868
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,830
- Two.
- Two.

1869
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,060
(The boat is going forward
according to the command.)

1870
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,470
- Two.
- Two.

1871
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,240
- This is fun.
- One.

1872
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,140
- This is fun.
- Two.

1873
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,580
(They're done
with the rowing practice.)

1874
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,770
All of a sudden...

1875
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:22,080
- Stop.
- Stop.

1876
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,580
- Stop.
- You should stop.

1877
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,390
- Stop.
- Get it together.

1878
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:28,250
You'll kill us all.

1879
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,950
- Guys, let's enjoy it.
- Be careful.

1880
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:33,180
Guys, we only live once.

1881
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:34,950
Let's enjoy our past.

1882
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:37,160
- What does it mean?
- Enjoy what?

1883
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,890
I keep talking nonsense
because I'm scared.

1884
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:40,100
Listen up.

1885
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:43,270
If the boat flips over or you're
bounced off the boat,

1886
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:44,790
put your head towards the upper part
of the river,

1887
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,310
your legs towards the lower part
of the river,

1888
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:48,370
and spread your arms
like a scarecrow.

1889
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:49,770
Keep your eyes on
the lower reaches...

1890
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,200
- and let yourself be carried away.
- Got it.

1891
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,370
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1892
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,180
But we won't fall, right?

1893
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:55,470
(Laughing)

1894
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:57,180
We won't fall. Why would you...

1895
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,680
Yes, sir. Do not worry.

1896
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,220
- I'll do as you said.
- Why assume we're going to fall?

1897
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,890
We didn't know we'd get to do this.

1898
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:05,020
It's such an honor.

1899
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,060
Why do you want to give
the instructor a good impression?

1900
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,250
Let's go. Both sides, one.

1901
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,390
- One.
- One.

1902
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,890
- Two.
- Two.

1903
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,370
- One.
- One.

1904
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,970
- Two.
- Two.

1905
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,390
- One.
- One.

1906
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:17,040
- Two.
- Two.

1907
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,000
(Seok Sam's oar
barely touches the water.)

1908
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,410
- One.
- Someone is not working hard.

1909
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:22,770
- He's not doing it properly.
- Gosh, seriously.

1910
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:24,080
- Don't just swing it in the air.
- Don't just...

1911
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,500
touch the water.
Put your oar deeply into the water.

1912
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,700
- Understood.
- When it comes to rafting,

1913
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,680
teamwork is
the most important thing.

1914
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,790
- Got it.
- If the boat doesn't move fast,

1915
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,350
- it could flip over.
- He said we should move fast.

1916
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:35,020
- I'll show you.
- We must move as one.

1917
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,890
- Use your core muscles...
- Flex my core muscles?

1918
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:37,950
and put your oar into the water.

1919
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,120
You shouldn't swing it in the air.

1920
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,390
- Got it.
- Put it into the water.

1921
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:41,830
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1922
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:44,020
- Keep that in mind to stay safe.
- Gosh. Look at him.

1923
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,290
- Understood.
- Mister.

1924
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,890
I told you not to just sweep
the surface halfheartedly...

1925
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:49,270
- like this.
- I wasn't doing it halfheartedly.

1926
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:50,270
As if he were scooping
some smoothie.

1927
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:51,660
- I'm doing my best.
- Gosh, seriously.

1928
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,430
- Stay alert. One.
- One.

1929
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,680
- Two. One.
- Two.

1930
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:57,140
- Oh, gosh.
- What was that?

1931
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,970
(What was that?)

1932
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,040
- There's a military base nearby.
- They must've fired a cannon.

1933
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,580
- Oh, I see.
- I think it was a cannon.

1934
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:04,270
- Gosh. What was that?
- Hey, did you just swear?

1935
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,680
- Don't swear.
- I'm sorry.

1936
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,120
- I was so scared.
- We're crashing into it.

1937
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,310
Don't push. I said, don't push.

1938
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:11,390
- They fired a cannon.
- Let's go. One.

1939
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:14,060
The instructor ran out of
his patience. "I said, don't push."

1940
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:15,850
- This is driving me nuts.
- Let's go.

1941
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:17,620
- Here we go. One!
- One!

1942
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,120
- Two!
- Two!

1943
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,560
- Louder!
- One!

1944
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,100
- One!
- One!

1945
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,640
- Two!
- No.

1946
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,330
(They finally approach
the rafting course.)

1947
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:27,910
- Hey, look over there.
- One.

1948
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:29,080
- It's coming.
- It's coming!

1949
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,080
Hey, it's coming.

1950
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,640
- It runs so fast.
- Two.

1951
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,870
- Should we keep rowing there?
- Yes. Keep rowing.

1952
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,870
- Two.
- No. We shouldn't move that way.

1953
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,080
- My gosh.
- Hey.

1954
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,680
- Oh, no.
- I don't think we can do this.

1955
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:44,390
- Oh, no.
- I don't think we can do this.

1956
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,290
(Rattling)

1957
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:50,000
- Keep rowing.
- I don't think we can do this.

1958
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,830
- Gosh. What do we do?
- We almost died.

1959
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:55,540
(The swift current area continues.)

1960
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:58,740
(The members continue groaning.)

1961
01:05:58,740 --> 01:05:59,870
- We have to keep rowing.
- Keep rowing.

1962
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,060
- One!
- One.

1963
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,200
- Two!
- Two.

1964
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,000
- Don't panic.
- Two.

1965
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,270
- One. Two.
- One. Two.

1966
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:08,620
(The second swift current area
welcomes the scaredy-cats.)

1967
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:09,720
- Look how fast it's running.
- My gosh.

1968
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,370
- The water is running so fast.
- What should we do?

1969
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:13,810
- Two! Keep rowing!
- We have to keep rowing.

1970
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:14,950
- Be careful!
- My gosh!

1971
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:16,950
- Gosh. Look at the whirlpool.
- My gosh.

1972
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,850
- Two!
- Two!

1973
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,020
- One! Two!
- One! Two!

1974
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,950
- We can't do this!
- Please!

1975
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:26,060
- Gosh!
- Oh, no! Please. This is so scary.

1976
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:28,220
Please! Oh, no!

1977
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:29,930
Please make it stop.

1978
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,810
- It's too fast here!
- Gosh!

1979
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,810
- Keep rowing.
- My gosh!

1980
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:37,930
(Swaying)

1981
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:39,750
- Keep rowing.
- My gosh!

1982
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:41,810
- Suk Jin, sit up!
- Hey, look at Suk Jin.

1983
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,450
- Be careful.
- Help Suk Jin!

1984
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:44,910
- Gosh. I was so surprised.
- Oh, no. We'll fall.

1985
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,950
(The big rapids won't even let them
pull themselves together.)

1986
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:52,250
Let's move forward!

1987
01:06:56,830 --> 01:07:00,520
(The members' faces look ugly
as they row through rapids.)

1988
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,770
Let's move forward!

1989
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,000
My gosh!

1990
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,240
- Keep rowing. One.
- There's a rock.

1991
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:06,140
(The boat crushes into the rock.)

1992
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:07,200
- That was scary.
- No!

1993
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,470
- I said this would happen!
- Be careful.

1994
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:10,700
My gosh. This is no joke.

1995
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:12,680
- Sit up, everyone.
- Sit up straight.

1996
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,640
- Jae Suk, sit up straight!
- Hey.

1997
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,750
- Keep it together! This is real.
- I said this would happen!

1998
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:18,750
- Hey, pull yourself together.
- This is no joke.

1999
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:20,180
This is no joke.

2000
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,620
- This is no joke.
- Think that we're...

2001
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,790
- escaping a jungle river.
- Hey.

2002
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:24,990
This is no joke.

2003
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:26,580
Let's go!

2004
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,500
(Team Stop's motorboat
starts moving.)

2005
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,520
It's pretty.

2006
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,390
This is so nice.

2007
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:32,930
(They're enjoying the scenery
of the Hantan River relaxedly.)

2008
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:34,390
We all look so relaxed.

2009
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:37,240
I guess this is how relaxing it is
to ride a motorboat.

2010
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,370
- This is nice, Ji Hyo.
- Indeed.

2011
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:39,930
We can enjoy the scenery.

2012
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,270
It's much better than I thought.
When I heard it was a motorboat,

2013
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:45,140
I expected it
to move up and down a lot.

2014
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,200
Ones that bounce.

2015
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:48,270
You have such a wild imagination.

2016
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,620
I'm talking about small boats,
you know.

2017
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,220
We've been fooled so many times...

2018
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:52,520
- I can't trust them.
- by the staff members.

2019
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,020
It's beautiful.
I'll take some photos.

2020
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,560
(Today, they can just relax
and enjoy themselves.)

2021
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,750
Do motorboats run
in the morning too?

2022
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,180
(Today, they can just relax
and enjoy themselves.)

2023
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:04,750
By the way, sir,
if you swim in the river...

2024
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:06,790
Are there any dangerous things
living in the river?

2025
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,470
- It's a little scary, right?
- Yes.

2026
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:11,160
- You don't know what's underneath.
- Exactly.

2027
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:14,660
In movies, a monster appears
when people enjoy riding a boat.

2028
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,140
- And the boat flips over.
- Yes. Usually, that's what happens.

2029
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,580
I mean, if you put your hand
in the water just this much...

2030
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,680
Oh, my. The water is so clear.

2031
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,810
The monster would bite your arm
and drag you into the water.

2032
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,910
(The other four members don't even
have time to imagine such a thing.)

2033
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:28,590
It's so beautiful.
Look at the cracks in the rock.

2034
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,710
Haha must be shivering with fear.

2035
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:33,160
(That's obvious.)

2036
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,660
He looked pale earlier.

2037
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,760
There's a rock in front of us!

2038
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:37,920
Left turn!

2039
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,370
(The instructor won't
turn the boat.)

2040
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:40,890
Left turn! Mister!

2041
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,170
- Row.
- Mister!

2042
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:43,800
- "Mister?"
- Gosh. Mister!

2043
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,340
- We're about to hit the rock!
- Hey.

2044
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,630
- We're about to hit the rock!
- Hey.

2045
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:50,510
(The boat ended up colliding
with the rock.)

2046
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,580
- Gosh. Mister!
- Be careful.

2047
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:55,710
- He let it happen intentionally.
- Instructor.

2048
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:57,420
I need to pee, sir.

2049
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,450
Just go ahead and pee.

2050
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:59,510
Mister!

2051
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,680
- Gosh, seriously.
- Stop pulling pranks.

2052
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,710
Hey, even my underwear is wet.

2053
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:04,790
Did he do it intentionally?

2054
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:06,180
I wear one pair a day.

2055
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:07,380
One pair a day?

2056
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,630
I'm sorry, sir.

2057
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:11,000
Why didn't they tell us
to bring an extra pair of underwear?

2058
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,700
- They told us.
- When did they tell you?

2059
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:13,920
Why didn't they tell me?

2060
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,430
- When you were on the plane.
- Really?

2061
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,560
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.

2062
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,760
- It's so scary.
- This is no joke.

2063
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,100
- But...
- Sir, this is no joke.

2064
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,270
- But isn't it thrilling and cool?
- It's scary.

2065
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:24,470
- What's cool about this?
- We're enjoying our lives.

2066
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,640
You were lying down here earlier.

2067
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,800
You were lying around.

2068
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,170
Don't you think it's cool?

2069
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:30,310
- It's amazing that we can do this.
- Suk Jin.

2070
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:32,050
Your pants are so thin
that I can see your underwear.

2071
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:34,710
(The white see-through pants)

2072
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,710
- That's the worst.
- It's okay.

2073
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:38,550
- Are you wearing black underwear?
- He's right.

2074
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,220
- Yes. How did you know?
- We can see them.

2075
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,260
- He's wearing black underwear.
- At a spot like this...

2076
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:44,160
Now, I see why people do this.

2077
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,390
- It's kind of sexy, right?
- It's thrilling, right?

2078
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,930
All right. Let's go.

2079
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,340
- Let's go. One.
- One.

2080
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,340
- Where are you going? Stop.
- Two.

2081
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,370
- This is fun.
- Aren't we going?

2082
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,800
- No. We won't go anywhere.
- Is it over?

2083
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,410
No. There's something we should do.

2084
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:57,880
Come on. Please don't do it again.

2085
01:09:57,930 --> 01:09:59,470
- Someone will fall out of the boat.
- We'll...

2086
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,510
We'll play a game.

2087
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:03,310
- Why should we play a game?
- Someone will fall into the water.

2088
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:04,880
- The loser is chosen randomly.
- Really?

2089
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,880
- That's the worst.
- Randomly.

2090
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,380
- Hey, what's your name?
- Suk Jin.

2091
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,210
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be disrespectful.

2092
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,420
- I'm sorry. My apology.
- The four of you...

2093
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,850
- Put your oars in front.
- Okay.

2094
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,520
- Here?
- Yes.

2095
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,390
- What's going on?
- What are we going to do?

2096
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,420
- Okay. Put it in there.
- Sir.

2097
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,060
- Please go easy on us.
- Now...

2098
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:23,260
I'm scared.

2099
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,370
- Please give me your glasses.
- Pardon?

2100
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,540
- Please give me your glasses. Yes.
- My glasses?

2101
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,560
- Why do you need his glasses?
- Jae Suk, you too.

2102
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,600
- Why do you need our glasses?
- There must be a reason.

2103
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,800
- Can you hold their glasses?
- What is he trying to do?

2104
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,640
- But our feet are secured.
- Now...

2105
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,710
Take your feet out of the loops.

2106
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,050
- No.
- Why should we?

2107
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,140
- Take your feet out of the loops.
- Why suddenly...

2108
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:39,790
- Please don't do that.
- Why are you being like this?

2109
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:41,840
- What is wrong with you?
- Why are you acting like a thug?

2110
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,380
- Sir, please.
- Come on.

2111
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,590
Take your feet out now.

2112
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:46,460
- We're not that kind of people.
- It's okay.

2113
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:48,830
- Take your feet out...
- But the weather is...

2114
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:50,420
- and face forward.
- It's quite chilly.

2115
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,720
Face forward...

2116
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,020
and sit cross-legged.

2117
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,220
- Then we'll fall into the water.
- Don't do that.

2118
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:56,370
- Sit cross-legged.
- We'll fall out of the boat.

2119
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:57,430
- No, you won't.
- Come on.

2120
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:58,430
- I mean...
- You won't if you get lucky.

2121
01:10:58,430 --> 01:10:59,560
Why should we dive into the water?

2122
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,170
- Why are you making us do this?
- Face forward.

2123
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:03,270
- You should do it while rafting.
- What's wrong with that man?

2124
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,840
Face forward. Come on.
And sit cross-legged.

2125
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,050
- I'm sitting cross-legged.
- Gosh.

2126
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,100
Hey, are you guys enjoying this?

2127
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,380
All of us?

2128
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:09,470
Hold the life vest
of the person in front of you.

2129
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:10,750
- Then we'll fall into the water.
- What?

2130
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,590
We'll definitely
fall into the water.

2131
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,450
- What kind of game is this?
- I'm scared of things like this.

2132
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:16,380
The two in the front,
hold your life vests.

2133
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,490
- Obviously, we'll fall.
- We'll fall into the water.

2134
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:20,660
- Do you think we're stupid?
- We're not stupid.

2135
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,090
- It's just a game.
- We're not stupid.

2136
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,520
Please do as I say.

2137
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,720
- Face forward.
- Gosh, seriously.

2138
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,300
- We have no choice.
- Okay.

2139
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,840
- What should we do now?
- In this position,

2140
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,930
lean back and forth.

2141
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:31,500
- One, two.
- What is this?

2142
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,960
One, two.

2143
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,710
- One, two.
- What is this?

2144
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:36,100
One, two.

2145
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:40,170
(What kind of game
are they playing?)

2146
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,910
Move faster. One, two.

2147
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,380
- One, two.
- One, two.

2148
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,550
(Pushing)

2149
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:49,710
(They fall into the water.)

2150
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,920
(Unlike what he said,
all of them fell into the water.)

2151
01:11:56,830 --> 01:12:00,890
(Their faces look ugly again.)

2152
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,260
Why did you do that?

2153
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,960
(It's an experience activity
at the trainees' level.)

2154
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,840
Gosh! Mister!

2155
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,740
Hey, you punk! I'm sorry.

2156
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,080
My gosh.

2157
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:14,950
Why did you do that?

2158
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:17,170
Gosh. I can't believe you.

2159
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,250
Hey, how could you?

2160
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:21,250
Why would you do that?

2161
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,010
- Why did you push us?
- Hey, how could you?

2162
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,310
- My gosh.
- Gosh, I'm so cold!

2163
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:26,460
The water is so cold. Darn.

2164
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,090
(The water is so cold
that they can feel the autumn vibe.)

2165
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:29,260
- This is so annoying.
- Gosh.

2166
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:31,800
This is so fun.

2167
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,300
(They're getting back on the boat.)

2168
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,890
- Haha, help me.
- It was quite fun.

2169
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:37,740
Pull me up.

2170
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,960
- Okay.
- Wait! My butthole!

2171
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,600
(The man in black underwear got it
stuck in the wrong area.)

2172
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:47,750
(They're helping the members without
considering the body structure.)

2173
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:48,970
Gosh. I'm so annoyed.

2174
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,140
Gosh, it hurts.

2175
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,490
(The members groan here and there.)

2176
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:55,250
- Darn! Ouch. It hurts.
- It hurts, right?

2177
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,460
- Gosh, seriously.
- What is this?

2178
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:00,830
- You said we'd play a game.
- Mister.

2179
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:02,800
Is this how you run your business?

2180
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,260
- Let's go now.
- My gosh.

2181
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Hey, what's wrong? Be careful.

2182
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:09,390
- Hey, how old are you?
- I'm old enough.

2183
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,700
- Sir.
- Hold me.

2184
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,060
Don't do such a thing.
That wasn't funny.

2185
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,340
- Hey, guys.
- All right?

2186
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,770
- Let's enjoy our lives!
- My gosh.

2187
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:16,930
Isn't this fun?

2188
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:20,080
(Then go into the water again.)

2189
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:25,490
(He ran his mouth thoughtlessly
and fell into the water again.)

2190
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:27,010
- Enjoy your life!
- He's enjoying it too much.

2191
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,490
Are you all right?

2192
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:32,680
- What did you say?
- Are you okay?

2193
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,220
Do I look like I'm okay?

2194
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,130
I'll pull you up.

2195
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,020
(He's fluttering
while making a weird noise.)

2196
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,260
Pull me up.

2197
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,700
(Groaning)

2198
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,170
How nice. So Min, I feel so relaxed.

2199
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:49,240
- It's so beautiful.
- Indeed.

2200
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:52,340
Hey, we made the right choice.

2201
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,770
Wouldn't it be dangerous...

2202
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:57,270
if their rafting boat came close
to ours while coming down?

2203
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,120
- They're coming.
- My goodness.

2204
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,950
Aren't they the other cast members?

2205
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,790
My gosh.

2206
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:07,630
They're not rowing properly.
It's a mess. Look at them.

2207
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,260
They look tired.

2208
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:11,420
Oh, dear.

2209
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,890
- Is that a motorboat?
- Oh, there they are.

2210
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,000
Are the others riding
that motorboat?

2211
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,130
- I don't see them.
- They're coming.

2212
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,840
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, there they are.

2213
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,100
- I'm jealous.
- It's like a TV commercial.

2214
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:24,240
- It must be so relaxing.
- They are enjoying the ride.

2215
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,510
(People on the motorboat
are cheerful.)

2216
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:28,380
- Jae Suk.
- You are working hard.

2217
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,450
How is it?

2218
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:31,420
- Hey.
- Hey.

2219
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,490
- Hey.
- Splash water.

2220
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:34,510
- Shall I do that?
- Yes.

2221
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:35,710
- Bring the boat closer.
- Splash water.

2222
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:37,050
- Let's go closer.
- Shall we go closer?

2223
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,120
Bring the boat closer.

2224
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,850
Are you having fun?

2225
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,090
Hello.

2226
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,960
- You are working hard.
- How is it?

2227
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,720
(Get some water.)

2228
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,560
It's cold.

2229
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,890
(Despite the water,
Team Motorboat is happy.)

2230
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:51,090
- It's cold.
- I am jealous.

2231
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:52,930
I am jealous.

2232
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:54,560
You worked hard.

2233
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,670
- You worked hard.
- I got soaked.

2234
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,910
Thank you for your hard work.

2235
01:14:58,010 --> 01:14:59,140
Thank you for your hard work.

2236
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,380
We fell into the water.

2237
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,470
- Did you fall into the water?
- What?

2238
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:02,580
- We fell into the water.
- Really?

2239
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,640
- Yes.
- The instructor threw us in.

2240
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,840
- The instructor threw us in.
- Really?

2241
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,840
- We fell into the water.
- He threw us into the water.

2242
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,090
- Really?
- We got soaked.

2243
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:09,680
- We got pushed into the water.
- Thank you.

2244
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,590
Sir, I had so much fun.

2245
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,160
- You complained earlier.
- I will visit with my son.

2246
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,020
- You complained earlier.
- I was joking earlier.

2247
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,850
- Seriously.
- I don't get him.

2248
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:21,200
- It's too late to say that.
- He has many rooms inside him.

2249
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,390
- A fake life.
- Yes.

2250
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,500
He leads a fake life.

2251
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,700
It was an honor.

2252
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:25,760
- Thank you.
- That's a lie.

2253
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,410
Look at that.

2254
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:29,510
(Look at him bring his hands
together.)

2255
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:32,880
I hadn't brought
additional underwear,

2256
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,170
but I survived.

2257
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:35,250
We did pretty well.

2258
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,750
- One underwear.
- You have a great track record.

2259
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,880
Shall I choose Go this time?

2260
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:40,380
Shall I choose Go this time?

2261
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:42,680
Let's have a discussion
before we choose.

2262
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,920
(What will be their choice
after choosing Stop?)

2263
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:46,550
Gangmujeong?

2264
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:48,850
- This place is so pretty.
- It's pretty.

2265
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:50,830
It's nice.

2266
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,500
What are you doing by yourself?

2267
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,460
I was learning about the place.

2268
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,590
What is this place, Jae Suk?

2269
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:57,700
What is this place?

2270
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,710
This is where King Sejong
oversaw Gangmu training.

2271
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:01,800
King Sejong?

2272
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,930
- Yes.
- King Sejang?

2273
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,540
- It's Sejong, not Sejang.
- Sejong.

2274
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,270
Gangmu training...

2275
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,710
involved military training
and a hunt.

2276
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:11,670
I thought "Mu" of Gangmu meant
something like this.

2277
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,310
(So Min thought it was dancing.)

2278
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,920
- Dancing?
- That was what I thought at first.

2279
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:16,710
- But it meant something like this.
- Hey.

2280
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:18,180
- In my opinion,
- Okay.

2281
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,420
we practically received
a penalty already.

2282
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,420
It seriously felt like a penalty.

2283
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:25,160
Cooling down in this sweltering heat
isn't much of a penalty.

2284
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,130
- We had a good time.
- Seriously.

2285
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:29,560
I guess someone is hiding
behind the screen.

2286
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,500
I think it's time for lunch.

2287
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,460
For goodness' sake.

2288
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,540
(Lunch is hidden
behind the screen on the pavilion.)

2289
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:37,380
I had a nice meal earlier.

2290
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,580
I haven't had anything
since morning.

2291
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,600
- You must be starved.
- Didn't you eat gimbap?

2292
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,140
- How about a sandwich?
- Gimbap?

2293
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,420
I don't like gimbap
that contains mayonnaise.

2294
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,490
I think mayonnaise is tasty.

2295
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:51,680
- Where on earth is Suk Jin?
- Where is he?

2296
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,020
- Is he taking a shower?
- Suk Jin.

2297
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,760
What is Haha doing?

2298
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,020
- There they come.
- I will tell them this.

2299
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:58,800
Suk Jin, run so that you won't be
the last one!

2300
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,800
Don't be the last one!

2301
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,240
- Haha!
- Suk Jin can't run right now.

2302
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,590
- Don't be the last one!
- He doesn't have the energy.

2303
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:05,910
Suk Jin is running.

2304
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:07,010
- Is that Suk Jin?
- Thank you.

2305
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:09,880
- I think he will fall down.
- He runs with small strides.

2306
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,470
He looks weak.

2307
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,750
Hurry up!

2308
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:13,800
He looks weak.

2309
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,340
(The younger man who is 44 years old
comes from behind.)

2310
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,120
Run! Either one could win.

2311
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,750
- There you go.
- Haha is fast.

2312
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:20,620
- You are fast.
- Haha is fast.

2313
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:21,710
- You are fast.
- Success.

2314
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,590
- Success.
- You are fast.

2315
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:26,590
Are you enjoying the Cheorwon trip?

2316
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:27,720
- We are loving it.
- Yes.

2317
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,200
How were the rafting experience
and motorboat ride?

2318
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,390
- Those of us who only chose Go...
- It was so nice.

2319
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,300
kept receiving
one penalty after another.

2320
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,460
We are on a losing streak.

2321
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,540
To be honest, you should have known
from the sound of Go.

2322
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:40,340
- Struggles.
- The vibe of the word is...

2323
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:43,210
- It has the vibe of a disaster.
- It has the vibe of going out...

2324
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:44,340
- with momentum.
- A disaster.

2325
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,410
At this point, it can't be helped.

2326
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,910
Suk Jin has
about five personalities today.

2327
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:50,170
- It was scary.
- I got scared earlier.

2328
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,550
When we were on the boat...

2329
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:53,180
When we pushed the boat and such,

2330
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,210
he went, "What are you doing?
How old are you?"

2331
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:57,510
- Really?
- When we were done,

2332
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,630
we went, "We enjoyed ourselves
thanks to you."

2333
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:01,880
- That's right. We saw him do this.
- We saw him do this.

2334
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,390
- This, right?
- I felt bad.

2335
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:05,460
- What's wrong with him?
- Suk Jin, your lips are blue.

2336
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,420
- What?
- Where did your lips go?

2337
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,920
- What? I never had them.
- Where did your lips go?

2338
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,590
- Are you okay?
- By the way,

2339
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:12,240
why do you look so haggard
when you haven't done much today?

2340
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,430
- Why do you look so tired?
- I am tired.

2341
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:14,910
Your hairstyle is a miss.

2342
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:15,970
Really? This hairstyle is trendy.

2343
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,600
- You had a different hairstyle.
- Your hair was blowing in the wind.

2344
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,580
Isn't that Chakra's hairstyle?

2345
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,600
You are right.

2346
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,880
(She ended up resembling
an old idol group, not NewJeans.)

2347
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,750
You can choose Go or Stop
for the next course.

2348
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:27,790
- What should I choose this time?
- I will choose Go no matter what.

2349
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:30,660
The mission for a sound hint is...

2350
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:33,130
Trips are in the Order of Happiness.

2351
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:35,590
At each course,
you got your photos taken.

2352
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:36,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

2353
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:37,660
(The photos captured
their happy memories.)

2354
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,500
(Look over here.)

2355
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,830
Let's go.

2356
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:42,840
(The staff members took photos
at each course.)

2357
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,460
(A photo of a relaxing moment)

2358
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:45,930
(A photo of a difficult moment)

2359
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,630
- All right.
- Let's go.

2360
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:53,380
(They got numerous photos taken
without knowing what they were for.)

2361
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:56,050
We picked each member's best photo
ahead of time.

2362
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:57,120
- The best photo.
- The best photo.

2363
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,380
- When did they take my photos?
- Your facial expressions...

2364
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,620
Throughout the trip.

2365
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:03,460
AI analyzed the facial expressions
to measure the happiness index.

2366
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:06,050
- Only the two members...
- I can't believe it.

2367
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:08,130
with the highest scores
will receive the hint.

2368
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:09,500
- It will be me.
- Please pick...

2369
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,830
- a course...
- I win if my gums are showing.

2370
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:13,830
you particularly enjoyed.
Course 1. Course 2.

2371
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:16,130
- I liked Course 1.
- I liked Course 1.

2372
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,130
- Rafting was okay.
- Rafting.

2373
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:19,240
Those who rode the motorboat
instead of rafting...

2374
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,910
shouldn't talk about rafting.

2375
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:23,100
No one talked about rafting.

2376
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:24,630
No one talked about rafting.

2377
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:26,410
- Don't talk about it.
- Are you exhausted?

2378
01:19:26,410 --> 01:19:28,010
- Yes, I am exhausted.
- His arm is hanging loose.

2379
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:30,270
- Lean on me.
- Let's see Haha's result first.

2380
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:34,810
- Is it Se Chan's result?
- It's Haha's photo from rafting.

2381
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:36,310
- It's Se Chan's photo.
- I am smiling from ear to ear.

2382
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,420
- Is it Haha's photo?
- It's Haha's photo.

2383
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:38,460
The analysis result.

2384
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:39,760
(Haha managed a smile
on the rafting boat.)

2385
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,850
The analysis result revealed...

2386
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:43,330
that he is a middle-aged man
who is smiling sadly.

2387
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:45,590
- Smiling sadly.
- He is a middle-aged man.

2388
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:48,870
(A middle-aged man
who is smiling sadly)

2389
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,200
A middle-aged man
who is smiling sadly.

2390
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,910
- It's spot on.
- The index is 42.3 percent.

2391
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:54,540
- It's spot on.
- Did you say 41.3 percent?

2392
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,930
- It's 42.3 percent.
- It's spot on.

2393
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:58,540
A middle-aged man
who is smiling sadly. It's perfect.

2394
01:19:58,540 --> 01:19:59,600
It isn't high.

2395
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,140
- Why is it calling me middle-aged?
- Jong Kook, which one will it be?

2396
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,580
I liked the first course.

2397
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,270
- The first course?
- It was very...

2398
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,510
- The atmosphere was nice.
- Carefree.

2399
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,590
It was therapeutic.

2400
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:09,550
You chose the monorail course.

2401
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,350
Let's check Jong Kook's result.

2402
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:14,090
I bet my result is mediocre too.

2403
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:15,630
My eyes aren't visible, so...

2404
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:17,350
- He looks sad.
- What? Why did you choose that?

2405
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:18,390
(The analysis of Jong Kook's face)

2406
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:19,520
(Everyone is smiling,
but one is daydreaming.)

2407
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,090
- You grimaced.
- Why did you choose that?

2408
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,460
- You grimaced.
- Yes.

2409
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:23,700
"A middle-aged man's blank face?"

2410
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,170
That's too much.

2411
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:26,760
I laughed so many times.

2412
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,100
That's a middle-aged man's
blank face.

2413
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,630
The happiness index is 0.2 percent.

2414
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:30,800
- Did you say 0.2 percent?
- Oh, no.

2415
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,950
Jong Kook doesn't feel happy.

2416
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:34,450
- What's wrong, Jong Kook?
- I laughed so many times.

2417
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:36,310
The AI is precise.
He is a middle-aged man.

2418
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:37,470
Se Chan comes next.

2419
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:39,120
- I choose Course 2.
- Course 2.

2420
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,210
- Yes.
- Choose rafting.

2421
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,550
- Rafting.
- Choose rafting.

2422
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:43,310
Se Chan chose rafting.

2423
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:46,020
- You fell into the water.
- You really fell into the water.

2424
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:48,220
Did you take it
when I fell into the water?

2425
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,350
Myung Jae.

2426
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:51,330
A middle-aged man
who is angry, but happy.

2427
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:53,520
- You are a middle-aged man too.
- The happiness index is 54 percent.

2428
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,720
(A middle-aged man
who is angry, but happy)

2429
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:59,240
(Happiness index: 54.2 percent)

2430
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,460
(The sad middle-aged men
are jealous.)

2431
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,800
- How nice.
- My gums are showing.

2432
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,800
That's happiness.

2433
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,580
- I enjoyed it too.
- Suk Jin, will you choose rafting?

2434
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,250
- Of course.
- Okay. Rafting.

2435
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,640
I can't choose the first one.
I didn't smile at all then.

2436
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,140
I am torn.
Which one should I choose?

2437
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,140
Look at his face.

2438
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:13,420
- He is angry.
- He is angry.

2439
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,250
- Look at his face. He is angry.
- He is angry.

2440
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,880
It's the face of a middle-aged man
who is pretending to be happy.

2441
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,720
(The face of a middle-aged man
who is pretending to be happy)

2442
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,330
(He pretended to be happy.)

2443
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:24,350
- The index is 9.8 percent.
- It's precise.

2444
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:25,800
- Did you say 9.8 percent?
- Yes, 9.8 percent.

2445
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,500
- Not bad.
- "Pretending to be happy."

2446
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,670
- It's better than his.
- Yes.

2447
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:30,700
- He leads a fake life.
- Mine was just above zero percent.

2448
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,000
- Jae Suk, will you choose rafting?
- What should I choose?

2449
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,240
I really enjoyed the observatory.

2450
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,430
Jae Suk, you should choose rafting.

2451
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,380
Rafting was a dynamic activity.

2452
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:40,450
Going up to the observatory
wasn't bad. I enjoyed it.

2453
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:41,640
You went up to it happily.

2454
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,920
I will choose a photo that was taken
while going up.

2455
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,380
I was happy then.

2456
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:45,450
(He was with Suk Jin.)

2457
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:48,290
- It's the worst.
- It's the worst.

2458
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:50,260
(It's a photo
from a mischievous moment.)

2459
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,510
The index is 0.5 percent.

2460
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:54,920
The face of a 25-year-old man
who is pretending to be surprised.

2461
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,550
- It's spot on.
- The index is 1.5 percent.

2462
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:57,920
- A 25-year-old man?
- It's still higher than mine.

2463
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,220
- For goodness' sake.
- His face was like this.

2464
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,330
Mine was just above zero percent.

2465
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:02,740
So Min, which course
will you choose?

2466
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:05,630
- During the monorail course,
- The motorboat ride.

2467
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,540
they teased me so much.
So I bet I grimaced.

2468
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:08,870
That's happiness, So Min.

2469
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:10,340
- Is that happiness?
- Of course.

2470
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,240
Rafting. I mean the motorboat ride.

2471
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,380
The motorboat ride?

2472
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:15,300
- What's up with that face?
- She looks sad.

2473
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:17,010
- What's up with that face?
- She looks sad.

2474
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:19,620
It's the face
of a female college student...

2475
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,210
who is suppressing laughter.

2476
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:23,120
- The index is 71.9 percent.
- My goodness.

2477
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,760
(A female college student
who is suppressing laughter)

2478
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,850
(A happy college student)

2479
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,880
- A college student?
- It's the highest.

2480
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,460
- It's high, Ji Hyo.
- I know.

2481
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,700
- I guess I was happy.
- Unbelievable.

2482
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,630
Isn't she more
of a mischievous college student?

2483
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:34,000
- Unbelievable.
- The face of mischief.

2484
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,760
- Ji Hyo, you... The motorboat ride.
- I will choose the motorboat ride.

2485
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:39,710
Ji Hyo's face was that
of a recent university graduate...

2486
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:41,370
who is suppressing laughter.

2487
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:42,840
- A recent university graduate.
- The index is 71.1 percent.

2488
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:46,470
(A recent university graduate
who is suppressing laughter)

2489
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:48,800
- Our results are the highest.
- My goodness.

2490
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,270
Our results are high.

2491
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:52,990
- The index is 71.1 percent.
- A recent university graduate?

2492
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,550
- Isn't she a middle-aged woman?
- She could be a senior manager.

2493
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:58,790
Ji Hyo and So Min
will receive a hint.

2494
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:01,260
- I should have chosen rafting.
- Let's share what we hear.

2495
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:02,420
I am serious, So Min.

2496
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,720
- No lies.
- I will choose a hint for Stop.

2497
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:05,920
I will choose a hint for Go.

2498
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,390
Go should be the better option
at this point.

2499
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,800
- Now...
- I will choose Go.

2500
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,890
- I will choose Go no matter what.
- Of course.

2501
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:13,040
- I...
- I can't choose differently...

2502
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,040
- at this point.
- Bracken.

2503
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,240
Which hint will you listen to?

2504
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:16,630
Will you listen to a hint for Go?

2505
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:18,130
A hint for Go, please.

2506
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:19,340
(Ji Hyo chooses a hint for Go.)

2507
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:21,710
Where...

2508
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:22,880
Do I put them on like this?

2509
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,450
(Listening to the hint
for Go of Course 3)

2510
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:40,830
(The familiar hissing sound?)

2511
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,090
So Min, come and hear it.

2512
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:45,090
So Min.

2513
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:46,300
(It's So Min's turn
to listen to the hint.)

2514
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:47,720
I listened to the hint for Go.

2515
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:48,740
Stop.

2516
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:53,170
I guess I look happy.
It's 71 percent.

2517
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:56,300
She will choose Stop four times?

2518
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:02,010
(Listening to the hint
for Stop of Course 3)

2519
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:05,680
(A sound that makes her smile?)

2520
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,120
- We did it.
- Yes.

2521
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,120
We did.

2522
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,920
You all heard the hint.

2523
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,380
- This is driving me crazy.
- Was it a good thing?

2524
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,630
- I had to walk.
- I'm not sure if it's good or bad.

2525
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:16,260
Ji Hyo, give me a hint.

2526
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:18,460
- I'll share it with So Min first.
- Okay.

2527
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,390
Go, Jae Suk

2528
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:22,370
- Go, Jae Suk
- What sound was that?

2529
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,210
Look at them discuss the hint.
I guess it was ambiguous.

2530
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:27,210
(Look at them discuss the hint.
I guess it was ambiguous.)

2531
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:32,970
Now you will choose
either Go or Stop in turn.

2532
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:34,270
Come and choose in turn.

2533
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,270
(Go Jae Suk steps up.)

2534
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,670
Gosh, he's going to choose Go.

2535
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,120
(Go, Jae Suk!)

2536
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:42,460
Go, Jae Suk

2537
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,550
(Jae Suk chooses Go
4 times in a row.)

2538
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:44,590
It's Go.

2539
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:46,460
(Jae Suk chooses Go
4 times in a row.)

2540
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:48,220
- I go no matter what.
- Next.

2541
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,220
(Haha goes next.)

2542
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:52,800
Haha, let's just...

2543
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,300
- I'll choose Go.
- All the men will choose Go.

2544
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,800
Be a man and go.

2545
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,370
(Will all the rafting members
choose Go again?)

2546
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:02,580
- That's right. He chose Go.
- Darn it.

2547
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:07,840
Go!

2548
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:10,810
I have no other choice now.

2549
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:11,920
(It looks like they are all going
to choose Go this time.)

2550
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,710
- Did you all choose Go?
- Will you choose Go?

2551
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:15,290
Stop? What do I do?

2552
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:16,290
(Stop? What do I do?)

2553
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:17,920
Go.

2554
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,660
- Will you go?
- I think I should.

2555
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:21,290
Se Chan, choose Go. Okay.

2556
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:23,090
I have no choice.

2557
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,330
- Did you all choose Go?
- Yes.

2558
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:25,670
- Even Se Chan?
- Yes.

2559
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:27,220
Then should I choose Stop?

2560
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,930
- Hey, you should choose Go.
- You kept choosing Stop, right?

2561
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:30,370
- Yes.
- Then you should stop.

2562
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:31,910
No. You can change it this time.

2563
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:32,910
Change it.

2564
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:34,300
I'll be the only one
who changes his choice, right?

2565
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,300
Yes.

2566
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:36,380
- I will...
- No.

2567
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,040
- It's Jong Kook's turn.
- No. I should go first.

2568
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:39,910
Gosh, I should...

2569
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,750
(Is it time to change
his choice to Go?)

2570
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:48,790
I'll stick to my choice.

2571
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:50,680
(He doesn't change his choice
and sticks with Stop.)

2572
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,420
Ji Hyo, what are you going to do?

2573
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:55,660
(Now it's Ji Hyo and So Min
who heard the hint.)

2574
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,700
I'll go next.

2575
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:59,220
- Go.
- It's their choice that matters.

2576
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,220
Right.

2577
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,340
(What is Ji Hyo's choice
after choosing Stop 3 times?)

2578
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:03,370
I'll...

2579
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:05,670
(She chooses Stop
without showing it to others.)

2580
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:07,260
What did she choose?

2581
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:09,430
She tried to hide it.

2582
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:10,800
Right. She can hide it.

2583
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,550
There comes the rascal.

2584
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,970
Rascal?

2585
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:15,810
There's the rascal.

2586
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:17,120
(What's Rascal Jeon's choice?)

2587
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:18,710
So Min!

2588
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:22,460
(They all made
the same choices as before.)

2589
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:25,220
We got the same results again.

2590
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:27,220
Four members chose Go.

2591
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,020
- And three members chose Stop.
- Seriously?

2592
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:31,020
You should've changed
your choice to Stop.

2593
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:33,130
- For me...
- Seriously, make Go good.

2594
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,870
I can't choose Stop.

2595
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:36,890
Hey, I bet Stop is
a good thing again.

2596
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,260
- Should I open Go first?
- My gosh.

2597
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:39,560
You can open it.

2598
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,910
Please.

2599
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:44,600
(What's the fourth course for Go?)

2600
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:49,670
(The stubborn Go lovers
finally seize the chance to win?)

2601
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:52,180
(They earn a meal with tenacity.)

2602
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,710
(And a beautiful tour course
filled with flowers.)

2603
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,590
(Go Jae Suk's surprising trip
will be revealed next week.)

2604
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,550
(And...)

2605
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:00,490
(The members are locked in 7 rooms.)

2606
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,960
(The greasy smell makes them
want to escape from the rooms.)

2607
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:06,590
(They all must pass the test!)

2608
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,060
(What's the highest mountain
in the world?)

2609
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,460
(All the members...)

2610
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:14,670
(didn't give the correct answer.)

2611
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:17,270
(Is there a spy
who gives wrong answers?)

2612
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:18,270
(Empty Head)

2613
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,300
(Among the 7 Empty Heads,)

2614
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:23,080
(there's only one betrayer.)

2615
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:25,550
(One of the members is...)

2616
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:27,810
(giving wrong answers on purpose.)

2617
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:29,660
(Mr. Run,
How’s the Food Over There?)
