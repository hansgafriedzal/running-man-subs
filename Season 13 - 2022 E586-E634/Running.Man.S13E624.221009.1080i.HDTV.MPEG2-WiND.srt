1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,710
(Running Man finally arrived
in Cheorwon last week.)

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,090
(But the members were told to make
a choice as soon as they got there.)

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,730
I just stop betting
once I make some money over a bet.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,160
I go no matter what.

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,690
I never stop.

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,530
(Go no matter what!)

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,870
(He just got gimbap.)

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,160
If I said stop,
I would've gone in there?

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,440
(That's how they began
the Go-Stop Race in Cheorwon.)

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,010
(A choice for the first activity)

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,150
(Jong Kook who values safety
chose Stop.)

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,770
(The tiger moths Jae Suk
and Suk Jin chose Go!)

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,050
(Go is for the hiking course.)

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,760
(The two unlucky guys
actually walked to the observatory.)

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,950
(Those who chose Stop
enjoyed the monorail ride.)

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,880
(Jong Kook chose Stop again
for the next course.)

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,400
(Jae Suk and Suk Jin chose Go
3 times in a row.)

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,230
(Those who chose Go went rafting.)

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,590
(The two stubborn guys
had to struggle.)

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,700
(A choice for lunch!)

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,200
(Jong Kook chose Stop
4 times in a row.)

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,070
(Jae Suk chose Go
4 times in a row.)

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,980
All right.

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,620
We got the same results again.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,590
- Four members chose Go.
- Okay.

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,410
- And three members chose Stop.
- Seriously?

27
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,790
You should've changed
your choice to Stop.

28
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,460
- For me...
- Seriously, make Go good.

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,850
I can't choose Stop with him.

30
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,190
Hey, I bet Stop is
a good thing again.

31
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,820
Seriously, I worked out
my lower body a lot today.

32
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,270
- Me too. I walked up the stairs.
- That's good exercise.

33
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,690
- Should I open Go first?
- You can open it.

34
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,960
Please.

35
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,130
(Will there be a twist for Go?)

36
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,400
You can open it.

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,630
Please.

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,430
This is so annoying. What's this?

39
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,540
(Meal set: rice, soy sauce,
and laver from Suk Jin's hometown)

40
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,980
(Laver, rice, and soy sauce)

41
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,910
- This is ridiculous.
- Isn't this a good thing?

42
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,680
- Why do you not change?
- It's just laver and soy sauce?

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,820
- This is a variety show.
- What's with her?

44
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,880
There should be a twist
in a variety show.

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,520
- I'll open the other one.
- Can I make a guess?

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,130
- I bet this is beef.
- Let me open it.

47
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,590
(Then what is Stop for?)

48
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,790
- My gosh.
- Darn it.

49
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,690
What's going on?

50
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,130
(It's a pork belly party.)

51
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,240
What's happening to me?

52
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,600
Why did you not change?

53
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,300
Why won't you change?

54
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,960
- My gosh. Why did you do this?
- Why did you not change?

55
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,930
- Why...
- How would we change our choice?

56
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,870
- This is about our pride.
- Seriously, you're...

57
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,370
Let's take this to the end.

58
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,620
- I'm serious.
- Hey.

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,920
- You...
- You'll see.

60
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,180
- I'll choose Go again.
- Let's do this until next week.

61
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,310
- I'll choose Go until the end.
- Jae Suk.

62
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,490
I told you before.

63
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,360
Stop being so stubborn.

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,020
- Just change your choice once.
- Will you let it go?

65
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,720
Why do you keep choosing Go?

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,960
- You should change your choice.
- All right.

67
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,750
We have delicious rice behind you.

68
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,460
And we have some meat.
Please enjoy it.

69
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,840
- That sounds great.
- This is pork belly.

70
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,710
- I wish we had ramyeon.
- This is great.

71
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,900
I'll grill it.

72
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,500
Let's grill it.

73
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,870
It looks really delicious.

74
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,710
I can't believe this.

75
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,740
(Team Go eats their rice
with soy sauce.)

76
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,680
I'm sick of eating this.

77
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,840
Isn't this soy sauce for raw fish?

78
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,750
This tastes like sushi.

79
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,780
It tastes like sushi, doesn't it?

80
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,020
- Why did you not change at all?
- Why did you not change?

81
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,300
It would've been fun
if she had changed it here.

82
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,220
Hyung In, you're really stubborn.

83
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,800
You never change it.

84
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,960
Do you have any sesame oil?

85
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,530
This would taste really good
with pork belly.

86
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,800
Of course.

87
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,500
Ji Hyo, you really
like black pepper.

88
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,080
- What?
- Ji Hyo loves black pepper.

89
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,970
- She keeps peppering the meat.
- Isn't this nice?

90
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,450
I'm sorry,

91
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,310
but I can make a wrap with the meat.

92
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,240
This is big enough to make a wrap.

93
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,490
I'm so sorry.

94
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,590
(Feeling bitter)

95
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,180
(He tries the pork belly sushi.)

96
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,180
This is really good.

97
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,020
(Amazed)

98
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,250
This is so tasty.

99
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,870
- Jong Kook, the meat is so good.
- I know.

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,140
Can't you at least give us
some sesame oil?

101
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,960
This is really long.

102
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,460
- I'm starving, so it tastes good.
- My gosh.

103
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,240
It actually tastes good because
we had fun in the water earlier.

104
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,470
This looks really good.

105
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,110
Hunger is the best sauce.

106
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,740
He's saying silly things again.

107
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,620
- He's out of his mind today.
- He's scaring me.

108
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,090
- He's...
- How many alter egos does he have?

109
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,420
He shows his true color
when he forgets about the cameras.

110
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,890
But he comes to his senses
when he sees the cameras.

111
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,960
Can you give us
some vegetables for a wrap?

112
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,330
- No, I can't.
- What about a pepper?

113
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,360
I can't.

114
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,990
I think this is really pathetic.

115
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,070
- He keeps asking for things.
- I know.

116
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,790
Why did you put the laver
all the way over there?

117
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,210
- Suk Jin.
- What's with him?

118
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
How many alter egos do you have?

119
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,170
- Which ego was that?
- He has three people inside him.

120
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,100
- My 6th ego.
- That was your 6th ego?

121
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,080
- I'll give meat to only one of you.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

122
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,840
- All right.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

123
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,210
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors. Yes.

124
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,750
- I won.
- Thank you.

125
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,710
I'll give it to the one who loses.

126
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,850
It's me.

127
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,920
- No, the last one to lose.
- It's me.

128
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,020
- I'm the one who lost.
- The last one to lose.

129
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,200
I'll give it to you.

130
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,500
Why would you give it to a loser?

131
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,700
- Are you sure you lost?
- Yes.

132
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,700
(The pork belly goes to Haha.)

133
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,860
Try this.

134
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,860
Haha, you can cut it in half.

135
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,460
- Share it with us.
- You can share it.

136
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,210
- You can cut it.
- Share it with us.

137
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,400
- Cut it...
- Rock-paper-scissors.

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,600
- Forget about rock-paper-scissors.
- Only one person.

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,010
- Just cut it in half.
- Just share it with me.

140
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,400
- You can cut it in half.
- They want to share it.

141
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,670
What's with him? Just cut it.

142
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,170
Let's just go and eat it.

143
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,410
Okay. Let's eat.

144
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,210
- Forget about the rules.
- I don't know. I'll just eat it.

145
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,250
We're here on a trip.

146
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,980
- Suk Jin, you can't do that.
- No, you can't.

147
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,390
Don't be like that.

148
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,850
Why would you stop me?

149
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,500
You can't do that.

150
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,150
(Bowing)

151
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

152
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,160
- I'll try it.
- Enjoy it.

153
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,460
(Smacking his lips)

154
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,730
This is really good.

155
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,710
Gosh, the garlic leaves are so good.

156
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,970
- Did you do it?
- Did you enjoy your meal?

157
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,600
- Yes.
- I really loved it.

158
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,250
- It's time for your last choice.
- Gosh, this is really...

159
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,910
I've already made up my mind.

160
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,820
- What?
- Go.

161
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,340
She will change at least once.

162
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,590
- This choice is about going home.
- You were right about that.

163
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,850
(If they make the right choice here,
they can go home right away.)

164
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,460
- Really?
- We can go home right away.

165
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,020
You should make a choice
only on your gut feeling.

166
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,290
Should I choose Stop?

167
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,070
- Those who get to go home...
- Gosh, this is really...

168
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,960
will get in
your manager's car here...

169
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,010
- and go home right away.
- Are you serious?

170
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,270
My goodness.

171
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,140
It depends on how you put it.

172
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,770
And the rest of you will go
to the flower garden near here.

173
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,520
You will enjoy
your last course there.

174
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,890
- I saw it earlier.
- That's the worst.

175
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,540
- I want to go there.
- I've had enough.

176
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,060
- I don't want to see anything.
- I know it's beautiful, but...

177
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,710
Honestly, I want to go there.

178
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,390
But would it say "Go home?"

179
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,960
- We should go now.
- Or...

180
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,850
- is it "Go to the flower garden?"
- Jae Suk.

181
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,290
Shall we choose Stop this time?

182
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,220
- Suk Jin.
- By the way,

183
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,630
- is it settled already?
- Yes.

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,500
- Is it "Go home?"
- This one is...

185
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,530
- quite tricky.
- They already have the board.

186
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,730
I really don't know
what she's up to.

187
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,440
- This is psychological warfare.
- I know.

188
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,310
- She keeps...
- Should I change my choice here?

189
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,040
- She never changed her choice.
- No, she might change.

190
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,450
- She's been on a single path.
- There have been three Stops.

191
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,450
- Will there be another Stop?
- But...

192
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,410
if she wanted a twist,
she would go on a single path.

193
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,410
- I bet Go is a bad thing.
- Hyung In is...

194
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,350
- She's...
- She's quite stubborn.

195
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,630
She's a lunatic.

196
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,130
She wasn't like that before.
She suddenly changed.

197
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,770
What's scary about Hyung In is
that she is...

198
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,520
a kind lunatic.

199
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,940
- She's a KW.
- A KW.

200
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,230
She's a KW.

201
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,400
A kind weirdo is the scariest one.

202
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,270
- A KW.
- That's the worst.

203
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,510
A kind weirdo is the scariest one.

204
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,510
It says I should choose Stop.
I tried it three times.

205
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,770
I tried it three times,
and it said I should choose Stop.

206
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,880
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk, you and Suk Jin...

207
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,820
Jae Suk, I tried it three times,
and it said I should choose Stop.

208
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,840
I'll...

209
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,340
- I'll just...
- Go?

210
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,650
Come out.

211
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,910
- Did you choose?
- Go.

212
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,420
(He chooses Go again.)

213
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,420
I can't follow him.

214
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,630
- Go or Stop?
- He's so unlucky.

215
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,700
Stop.

216
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,270
- But Jae Suk didn't...
- Go or Stop?

217
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,090
get the penalty last time.

218
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,640
He's been quite lucky recently.

219
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,810
- Is there a hint?
- We need to get lucky this time.

220
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,710
- This is it.
- To be honest,

221
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,310
this is the only one
we need to make the right choice on.

222
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,600
- Today, I chose...
- Nothing else matters.

223
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,210
Stop every time.

224
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,320
I chose Stop all day.

225
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,090
- Will you change it to Go?
- Hey, that's the two tiger moths.

226
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,110
- The two tiger moths.
- I can't choose Go.

227
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,150
(So Min chose Stop all day,
but she changed her choice to Go.)

228
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,830
I should change it
at the last minute.

229
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,520
- I chose Stop all day.
- If you and Jae Suk choose Go,

230
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,900
I will choose Stop!

231
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,020
- I will choose Stop!
- Gosh, this isn't going to be good.

232
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,230
- Oh, dear.
- Gosh, it's going to be worse.

233
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,030
- Once you choose Go...
- No.

234
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,580
- You should stick to Go.
- You two...

235
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,380
What should I do to go home?
Should I choose Stop?

236
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,650
Is Go for going home?

237
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,340
- Can I choose again?
- If you're rational about it,

238
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,770
Go is for going home.

239
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,040
Think of it that way.

240
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,820
- Ji Hyo, can you go first?
- Can I do it again?

241
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,480
I also chose Stop all day.

242
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,920
- Will you choose Go?
- I'll choose Go.

243
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,030
- Then it must be Go.
- Of course.

244
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,430
- I choose Go.
- Stop means you should stop.

245
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,490
- I'm...
- Stop is not going.

246
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,200
It wasn't my turn,
so I'll do it again.

247
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,040
- You already chose Stop.
- You chose.

248
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,260
What are you talking about?

249
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,710
Then I'll choose Go.

250
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,410
I think I should choose Stop.

251
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,940
- No, Jae Suk.
- Next week...

252
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,230
I don't think so either.

253
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,000
Hyung In asked
why we wouldn't change our choices.

254
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,100
That's why I changed mine.

255
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,370
You just said
you didn't make your choice.

256
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,210
Can I try it again?

257
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,850
Just choose Stop.

258
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,980
Okay. I think we should
choose Stop for everything.

259
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,620
I think that's
what Hyung In intended.

260
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,990
Make the right choice.

261
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,350
All...

262
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,570
- All Stop.
- Is it Stop?

263
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,670
Because she has no reason...

264
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,230
- to change at the last minute.
- I just chose Go...

265
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,360
- because that was my first choice.
- So there's no twist?

266
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,340
- Should I stick with my choice?
- Yes.

267
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,600
Jong Kook will choose Stop.

268
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,210
- Jong Kook will go on one path.
- I should go.

269
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,050
If I change my choice here,
I will be more upset.

270
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,550
- Right. Choose Stop.
- I'll stick with my choice.

271
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,870
- I'll just...
- I should've...

272
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,110
Okay. I'll choose Stop.

273
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,320
I think Stop is a good thing.

274
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,050
It was Stop all day,
so I'm confused.

275
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,350
It was Stop all day long.

276
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,530
- This is crazy.
- If I can go again, I choose Stop.

277
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,590
- Let's do this!
- Stop!

278
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,060
- I think Stop is a good thing.
- Good.

279
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,250
- Let's go. We'll see.
- All right.

280
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,620
Those who chose Go are Jae Suk,

281
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,390
- Ji Hyo, and So Min.
- Yes.

282
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,540
So this is like
Jae Suk versus Suk Jin.

283
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,910
- Gosh, this is so thrilling.
- I'm the only one who chose Go...

284
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,960
the whole time.

285
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,130
I changed my choice.

286
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,780
- I changed it too.
- I changed.

287
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,040
- Please.
- Give us the board.

288
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,210
Go is...

289
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,340
(Go has been a thorny path today.)

290
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,420
(What's the last choice
for going home?)

291
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,710
(Go for a shoot!)

292
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,350
Those who chose Go will do a shoot.

293
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,220
(Jae Suk will do
an additional shoot.)

294
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,620
Those who chose Go will do a shoot.

295
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,930
(We can go home now!)

296
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,300
There was no twist!

297
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,620
- It was Stop to the end.
- Unbelievable.

298
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,700
- I can't believe this.
- I knew it.

299
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,440
- The kind weirdo.
- You're really something.

300
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
- Go for a shoot.
- You can "stop" the shoot here.

301
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,310
- We can "stop" the shoot here.
- Yes.

302
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,050
- It didn't mean "to go home."
- See?

303
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,950
I chose the opposite
of So Min's choice.

304
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,420
She always gets unlucky
at the end of the show.

305
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,210
- Yoo Jae Suk, go
- Go

306
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,790
- This is the worst.
- Jae Suk is so unlucky.

307
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,610
The three of you will
go to the flower field...

308
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,010
- with many good photo spots.
- They'll love it.

309
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,660
- Enjoy the final tour course.
- That sounds great.

310
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,350
- Take good photos there.
- Enjoy yourselves.

311
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,200
- Let's go.
- He's bad at taking photos.

312
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,530
- Let's go.
- Jae Suk should go there.

313
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,200
- I'm curious about something.
- It's so beautiful here.

314
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,360
- He'll get much air time as always.
- Of course.

315
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Why didn't you create a twist?

316
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,360
- Is this okay? Why did you do that?
- I mean...

317
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,970
- Hyung In, you're scary.
- There was no twist, not even once.

318
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,730
- Why did you do that?
- Is she simply stubborn?

319
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,970
- We'll go crazy if we do it again.
- Let's just go. It's no big deal.

320
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,100
- I mean, why...
- We'll totally go crazy.

321
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,280
Why didn't you create a twist?

322
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,050
The four of you can go home now.

323
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,950
- Let's get going. We'll be off.
- Thank you.

324
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,820
- Have fun, guys.
- See you later.

325
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,140
- We'll get going.
- We'll leave so you can have fun.

326
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,380
- We'll get going.
- See you later.

327
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,690
- Let's go.
- I'll get going.

328
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,160
- Bye, guys.
- See you later.

329
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,620
- Bye, So Min.
- Hyung In, you're so scary.

330
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,330
You could've been left alone.

331
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,300
- Let's all go together.
- This never happened before.

332
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,490
I mean,
why would she stick to one path?

333
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,170
Oh, my. It's beautiful.

334
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,630
It's pretty, but it would've been
better if I had gone home.

335
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,280
- My, it's so pretty.
- Look at that.

336
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,950
Oh, my. I really like purple.

337
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,970
How pretty. Hey, look at this.

338
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,970
(Ji Hyo and So Min feel better
thanks to the flowers.)

339
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,340
We must take photos of this.

340
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,380
- Nice. It really is pretty.
- It's pretty, right?

341
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,690
Aren't you glad we came here?

342
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,880
- What?
- What I'm saying is...

343
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
- Going home would've been better.
- that at least...

344
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,330
- we get to enjoy this scenery.
- Where should we sit?

345
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,390
(They get in a vehicle
for the flower field tour.)

346
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,860
- Darn it.
- Give it to me.

347
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,860
Jae Suk,
please try to enjoy yourself.

348
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,130
- But I'm not in a good mood.
- We...

349
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,960
- I'm excited. It's so beautiful.
- I'm feeling good.

350
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,310
I'm half excited and half upset.

351
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,640
- This scenery...
- I mean, don't you think...

352
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,550
- This is nice, but...
- they should've changed it?

353
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,680
Normally, people make a twist.
You were so stubborn too.

354
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,710
- Right. Jae Suk was stubborn too.
- So Min, I just keep going.

355
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,010
And I don't like to stop.
I always go for it.

356
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,830
My, look at that.

357
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,030
It's pretty.

358
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,990
I want to go home,
but I'm enjoying this at the same time.

359
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,700
We would be happier
if we were on our way home.

360
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,720
I'll take close-up photos of them.

361
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,800
- How come they're all purple?
- Right? They're all purple.

362
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,910
They planted purple flowers
intentionally.

363
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,280
- It's beautiful.
- That hut will make a good photo.

364
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,940
(Exclaiming)

365
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,550
- It's pretty.
- Jae Suk, smile a little.

366
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,280
- Well, I'm doing my best.
- Jae Suk.

367
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,450
Go faster!

368
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,010
We're moving fast enough.

369
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,160
- Jae Suk, this is fun, right?
- Yes, I'm having a great time.

370
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,880
- Of course.
- It's fun because I'm with you two.

371
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,890
Let's stop here to look around
for a while.

372
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,570
- Can we take some photos here?
- Sure.

373
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,300
I don't want to take photos at all.

374
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,990
Jae Suk,
let's take a photo together.

375
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,840
Can I stay here?

376
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
(He refuses to get off.)

377
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,910
Jae Suk, come on.

378
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,730
- But...
- Jae Suk, come and have a look.

379
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,370
Gosh. Seriously.

380
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,080
- Shall I take a photo of you?
- You know how it feels...

381
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,370
- when you want to stop...
- You're so pretty.

382
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,080
visiting tourist spots
on a school trip, right?

383
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,280
- Shall I take a photo of you?
- Ji Hyo, take a photo of me.

384
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,710
Right. It really is pretty.

385
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,980
(Zoned-out Crazy Sisters are
busy taking photos.)

386
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,060
It's so beautiful.

387
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,430
There are many beautiful spots
in Cheorwon.

388
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,260
Jae Suk, you're good
at taking photos, right?

389
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,930
- Of course.
- Can you take a photo of us?

390
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,090
I'll do that.

391
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,760
Are we in the frame?

392
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,360
You guys look gorgeous.

393
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,670
Great. This is amazing.

394
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,840
(Zoned-out Crazy Sisters are
cheerful while working overtime.)

395
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,210
- Oh, my. It's great.
- We should save this memory.

396
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,680
Catch me if you can!

397
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,510
(Screaming)

398
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,290
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, let's get going.

399
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,480
- Let's leave before she gets back.
- Let's go.

400
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,030
- Hurry up and get in.
- Let's go.

401
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,530
Catch me if you can!

402
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,030
- Let's go.
- Where are you going?

403
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,570
- We don't have time for that.
- Where are you going?

404
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,200
Where are you going?

405
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,300
(So Min got too excited abruptly
because of the flowers.)

406
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,360
Wait for me.

407
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,360
I want to take a selfie
with the purple flowers.

408
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,970
- I don't want to take photos.
- I prefer the purple ones.

409
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,680
(A week later)

410
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,710
- Oh, that's true.
- Hey, hi.

411
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,420
- Hello.
- You're here.

412
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,010
- Jae Suk, you're here.
- Hello.

413
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,210
- Hello.
- Hi. I got here earlier than you.

414
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,210
- Stop lying. You didn't.
- Hello. Excuse me.

415
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,790
- I was in that small room.
- Why?

416
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,120
I was told
that I needed to fix my hair...

417
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,990
My gosh. You started
carrying this around again?

418
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,850
- Hey.
- That suits you.

419
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,530
My gosh. Look at that.
Jong Kook, that's too big.

420
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,670
Is that a trophy or something?

421
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,840
- Exactly.
- He drinks from a trophy?

422
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,310
- Is that a trophy?
- What brand is it from?

423
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,630
I don't know.

424
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,870
- Do you still use that? It's huge.
- Oh, I found it.

425
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,000
So Min, what's with your hair?

426
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,780
- I got a new haircut.
- You have bangs now.

427
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,450
Yes. Everyone reacted the same way.

428
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,290
- How did everyone react?
- They didn't seem surprised.

429
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,820
They seemed taken aback.

430
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,820
I pretended I didn't know.

431
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,880
I heard that we'd be
having guests today.

432
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
- Really?
- Really?

433
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
- I don't think so.
- NewJeans.

434
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,340
Hey, you... Oh, I get it.

435
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,480
- You see, So Min...
- Look at her hair.

436
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,040
- Is that why you got that haircut?
- No.

437
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,120
- I had bangs when I was 20.
- NewJeans.

438
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,040
- The trend is back after ten years.
- Don't be ridiculous.

439
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,850
- So I tried it once again.
- Keeping up with the trend...

440
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,180
- Did you want to look funny too?
- I don't like it so much.

441
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,130
- Tell me honestly.
- Why? I think she looks pretty.

442
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,020
Just like how comedians
wear bald wigs.

443
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,260
To be honest...

444
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,100
- NewJeans?
- Honestly... No.

445
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,920
- When Haha shaved his head,
- Yes.

446
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,560
- he looked so funny.
- Right.

447
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,500
- That's why I tried this style.
- Right?

448
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,030
- You should shave the front.
- You should shave your head too.

449
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,070
- You should've shaved this area.
- Or all except that area.

450
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,010
I don't think she did it
just to look pretty.

451
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,010
- Right.
- She wanted to look funny too.

452
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,410
Jong Kook, let's talk later.

453
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,140
(So Min's new haircut only gave
the others a reason to tease her.)

454
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,590
Before we begin the race officially,

455
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,410
- we'll give you ten diamonds each.
- What's going on?

456
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,820
- We get diamonds?
- Will NewJeans be here?

457
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,130
- No. He was talking about So Min.
- We get diamonds today. No.

458
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,190
- Maybe NewJeans will be here...
- Everyone got it.

459
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,020
You won't keep those diamonds.

460
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,100
Choose 2 members
and give them 5 diamonds each.

461
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,740
- Why should I?
- Directly?

462
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,430
- No, you will...
- Why should I give these away?

463
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,640
Well, that's the rule.

464
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,880
Oh, I see.

465
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,210
Don't be taken aback.

466
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,850
- You'll compete individually.
- Yes.

467
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,250
Obviously, the more diamonds,
the better.

468
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,680
The number of diamonds you have
will be revealed at the end.

469
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,490
So don't tell the others
how many diamonds you have.

470
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,090
Now, you will take turns
going to another room...

471
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,490
and put your diamonds in the baskets
of the members you choose.

472
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,150
(They'll move to the next room
to give away their diamonds.)

473
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,390
So we'll use diamonds
instead of potatoes today.

474
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,470
Shouldn't we tell each other?

475
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,970
Then I'll give mine to NewJeans.

476
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,190
You can discuss it before we begin.

477
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,690
- To our today's guest, NewJeans.
- Really?

478
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,930
- Gosh. That's not my intention.
- So Min, this is your chance.

479
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,370
- But...
- Do whatever you want.

480
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,140
- Whatever you want.
- Since she made me laugh,

481
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,210
I'll give mine to her too.

482
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,480
- I'll choose So Min and NewJeans.
- I'll give mine to So Min.

483
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,180
- I'll give mine to So Min too.
- You're making me uncomfortable.

484
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,420
Treat me as you always do!

485
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,650
This makes me uncomfortable.

486
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,920
Who wants to go first?

487
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
- I want to see...
- Shall I go first?

488
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,990
- Go ahead.
- Yes. Okay.

489
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,260
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

490
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,120
- Let's give each other some.
- My protruding mouth brother. Okay.

491
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,430
As the protruding mouth brothers,
let's give some to each other.

492
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,260
- Okay. I'll give you some.
- Hey, Se Chan.

493
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,850
- And Yeosu.
- Se Chan.

494
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,930
- Oh, right.
- Yes?

495
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,770
Se Chan, you have nothing in common
with Suk Jin, right?

496
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,820
Right. Not a thing.

497
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,060
Already?

498
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,030
(Se Chan enters the other room.)

499
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,030
Hello.

500
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:47,270
I'll give five of them
to my protruding mouth brother.

501
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,570
(He'll give five diamonds
to Jae Suk as he promised.)

502
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,570
And...

503
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,950
(Who did he give
the rest of the five diamonds to?)

504
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,650
(Haha said
he'd give his diamonds to So Min.)

505
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,080
Five for each, right?
I can't keep any, right?

506
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,760
I'll give half to So Min as I said.

507
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,120
So Min gave us a good laugh
with her new haircut.

508
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,790
So I'll give mine to So Min.

509
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,860
She's a valuable member.

510
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,900
And...

511
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,830
I'll give five diamonds
to NewJeans, So Min.

512
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,740
(Ji Hyo chose So Min as well.)

513
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,440
- I've already made my decision.
- Let me think.

514
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,740
- I thought about it a lot.
- So Min must've received a lot.

515
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,830
- I just want to give them some.
- Can I give away just one?

516
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,270
(What will the diamonds be
used for?)

517
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,750
(Today's set will be revealed now.)

518
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,190
(Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Suk Jin,
Ji Hyo, Haha, Se Chan, So Min)

519
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,160
(There are seven separate rooms.)

520
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,260
I'm hungry.
Something smells delicious.

521
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,290
- It's food, right? Am I wrong?
- Yes.

522
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,730
What is this?

523
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,790
I think we are playing a quiz game.

524
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,330
Gosh. I'm done for.

525
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,330
They did a great job.
What? Are we playing a quiz game?

526
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,710
Darn it.
I haven't studied for a while.

527
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,980
It's a quiz game.

528
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,180
What kind of quiz game?

529
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,480
I'm in trouble. It's a quiz game.
Se Chan, it must be a quiz game.

530
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,310
- So Min, I'm done for. Help me.
- Okay.

531
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,990
It looks like a quiz game.

532
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,850
It's a quiz game.

533
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,850
Give us a question.

534
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,580
Until further instructions,

535
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,730
- you're not allowed to come out.
- Of course.

536
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,200
Shortly,
you will receive the diamonds...

537
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,700
- that you obtained.
- Yes.

538
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,830
Count the diamonds quietly...

539
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,240
so that the others can't hear you.

540
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,330
- Got it.
- Okay.

541
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,030
Oh, you'll send them to my phone?

542
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,030
(Oh, you'll send them to my phone?)

543
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,910
I wonder how many I received.

544
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,010
(Although he has poor hearing...)

545
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,040
I shouldn't let the others know.

546
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,150
(Almost Deaf Ji has
a wild imagination.)

547
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,270
What? Oh, I thought you'd text me
to tell me the number.

548
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,220
There must be some in the case.
It's quite heavy.

549
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
(He received the jewelry briefcase
with excitement.)

550
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,260
Wait.

551
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,350
Oh, my. I received a briefcase.

552
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,730
Oh, my. I received mine.

553
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,820
- Great.
- This is...

554
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,700
I don't think I received many.

555
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,270
Shall I open it?

556
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,630
(They will check the number
of diamonds they obtained.)

557
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,130
- I'm sure I have no diamonds.
- Let's check.

558
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,940
(They will check the number
of diamonds they obtained.)

559
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,130
Let's open it.

560
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,240
(Ms. Jeon, the guest,
who seemed popular)

561
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,370
(Surprised)

562
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,010
Wow, that's a lot.

563
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,070
This is great.

564
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,540
I received a lot.

565
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,520
- This is like a festival!
- Thank you.

566
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,780
Not bad.

567
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,050
- Guys!
- Yes?

568
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,520
Thank you!

569
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,730
- Don't mention it.
- No problem, So Min.

570
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,700
- I love you!
- So Min, good luck.

571
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,170
- I hope you win today.
- You made the opening funny.

572
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,820
Seok Sam, I'm sorry!

573
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,740
Guys, are you serious?

574
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,440
- Suk Jin.
- I'm sorry.

575
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,940
- You should thank me, Suk Jin.
- I'm sorry, Seok Sam.

576
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,440
- I don't believe you.
- Ji Hyo.

577
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,180
I wanted to give you some, but
I couldn't find a reason to do so.

578
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,450
Today's race is
Mr. Run, How's the Food Over There?

579
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,610
- Okay.
- "Narco-Saints?"

580
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,980
- "How's the Food Over There?"
- We prepared...

581
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,420
- all kinds of delicacies for you.
- Wow.

582
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,580
(Various delicacies are prepared
for the members.)

583
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,820
In each round,
you'll be given one question.

584
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,490
If all of you get it right,
all of you get to eat food.

585
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,620
- Right? I knew it.
- Let's eat together!

586
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,360
This reminds me of "Narco-Saints."

587
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,900
- It's like "Narco-Saints."
- Should all of us...

588
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,330
- get the right answer?
- Yes, all of you.

589
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,030
- That's too hard.
- To pull it off,

590
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,860
the diamonds you have will play
an important role.

591
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,910
Yes.

592
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,910
Before the quiz starts,

593
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,330
you'll turn in some diamonds
without letting the others know.

594
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,110
If the total is more than seven,
you'll be given an easy question.

595
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,870
If it's between 4 and 6,
the difficulty level will be normal.

596
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,110
If it's three or fewer,
you'll be given a hard question.

597
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,020
- Let's all enjoy delicious food!
- Let's do this!

598
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,350
- Let's turn in one diamond each.
- Let's eat some food!

599
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,730
- If you have a lot, submit some.
- Let's turn in one diamond each.

600
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,320
Suk Jin,
turn some in no matter what.

601
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,730
Of course, I will. Trust me.

602
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,820
We get to eat food
only when all of us get it right.

603
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,670
- All of us should get it right.
- We always lied.

604
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,770
But let's gather diamonds this time
and show them what we can do!

605
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,170
We've been doing this together
for 13 years!

606
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,910
Let's create a heartwarming scene
since it's been 13 years.

607
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,030
Be quiet!

608
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,030
(Se Chan stops him.)

609
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,100
Who is being so loud?

610
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,340
Guys, did you have breakfast?

611
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,100
Hey, Ms. Jeon.

612
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,920
- Did you have breakfast?
- Did you have breakfast?

613
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,020
- Have you eaten?
- Listen, everyone.

614
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,420
(But...)

615
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,420
But one of you is a spy.

616
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,220
- Oh, gosh.
- What?

617
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,730
That's not fair.

618
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,200
The spy's goal is
to make it to the top three...

619
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,090
with the most diamonds
without getting caught.

620
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,270
- Gosh.
- Come on.

621
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,860
The citizens will win
if they arrest the spy.

622
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,360
The citizen with the most diamonds
will receive a prize,

623
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,800
and the spy will receive a penalty.

624
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,270
The citizens will lose
if they fail to arrest the spy.

625
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,980
All of them except for the citizen
with the most diamonds...

626
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,010
will receive a penalty.

627
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,110
- All of the citizens?
- We should catch the spy.

628
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,420
- Yes, we should catch the spy.
- The more diamonds you have,

629
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,520
- It's Se Chan.
- the better chance you have of winning.

630
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,080
- The spy...
- Se Chan must be the spy.

631
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
- Why me?
- Hey.

632
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,730
Se Chan,
you're unusually quiet today.

633
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,730
I'm not the spy.

634
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,730
- You were suspicious.
- You see, if one of us is a spy,

635
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,200
we won't be able to gather
seven diamonds.

636
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,520
That's right.
But we can get the right answer.

637
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,630
But won't the spy give
a wrong answer intentionally?

638
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,170
(The spy could give a wrong answer
to sabotage the citizens.)

639
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,940
Before we begin the first round,
we'll reveal the dish.

640
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,870
- What is it?
- Please come out and check it.

641
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,910
Oh, gosh.

642
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,250
- I should go out?
- The menu could motivate us.

643
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,950
- Wow. It must be Korean beef.
- It'll be cooked here.

644
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,250
- I really want to eat it.
- You're nervous, right?

645
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,040
- Hello. We should eat this.
- Look at this.

646
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,580
Is it toma... T-bone...

647
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,920
- It's T-bone steak.
- Gosh. It looks crazy good.

648
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,080
- It looks so good.
- It looks good.

649
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,930
The dish for the first round is
T-bone steak.

650
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,020
Right? I could smell something good
when I entered.

651
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,090
It looks amazing.

652
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,620
- Can hear the sizzling sound?
- Sure.

653
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,270
- We should hear it.
- Let's listen to the sound.

654
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,530
(The chef starts grilling the meat
in front of their eyes.)

655
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,100
Aren't you going to sprinkle
salt and pepper?

656
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,510
I seasoned the meat in advance.

657
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,040
- She seasoned the meat.
- Let's eat it.

658
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,450
(Will all the members succeed
and taste the meat?)

659
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,520
My, it looks so delicious, right?

660
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,880
It looks so juicy.

661
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,020
Did you get a new haircut
to celebrate being chosen as a spy?

662
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,160
- No.
- You're standing like a spy.

663
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,420
- Why is your face red?
- No... What?

664
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,620
Why is your face red?

665
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,930
Wait. Jae Suk was the only one
who was late.

666
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,520
- He's not wearing a cap.
- He's dancing.

667
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,230
He's not wearing a cap
because he's the spy.

668
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,790
- He's the spy.
- That's why he's not wearing a cap.

669
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,000
He's not wearing a cap.
He had his hair done.

670
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,130
What are they doing?

671
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,210
The improv comedy couple.

672
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,030
- The comedy duo,
- Right.

673
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,830
- Yoo Jae Suk and Han Min Kwan!
- She got a new haircut...

674
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,240
(Yoo Jae Suk and Han Min Kwan's
Gala)

675
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,070
(The senior and junior comedians'
joint performance)

676
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,720
So Min has been making
a lot of effort.

677
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,920
- Now,
- Hey, you seem...

678
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,490
- so enthusiastic today.
- please go back to your rooms...

679
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,810
- and close the doors.
- Okay.

680
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,810
- I'm not the spy. Trust me.
- She got a new haircut.

681
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,780
- It's not me today.
- I don't think this is necessary.

682
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,850
I'm so excited to have been chosen
as a spy after a long time.

683
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,050
I'm exhilarated.

684
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,730
I'll do my best.

685
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,360
What is he doing?

686
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,500
It looks so good.

687
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,530
Hey, hurry up.

688
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,270
- Spy.
- Gosh, it looks so good.

689
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,970
Let's eat it!

690
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,770
- It looks so good.
- We can't miss it.

691
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,770
Let's do this! We've got this!

692
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,250
To decide the difficulty level
of the question,

693
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,150
- we'll collect diamonds first.
- Okay.

694
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,540
We should all turn in a diamond.

695
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,950
- Let's all turn in a diamond.
- Turn in as many diamonds...

696
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,050
as you want
through the hole next to the door.

697
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,780
- Let's all turn in a diamond.
- Just as I said,

698
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,960
if you gather seven or more,
you'll get an easy question.

699
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,730
- A normal one for between 4 and 6.
- Okay.

700
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,430
A hard one for three or fewer.

701
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,400
- I'll turn in a diamond.
- Right. Let's eat the food!

702
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,860
If all the members give
the correct answer,

703
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,900
all of you will get to eat the food.

704
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,000
And three members
randomly chosen by the staff...

705
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,530
- will receive ten diamonds.
- What?

706
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,630
- Ten diamonds?
- What?

707
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,240
- But if any of you fails,
- We can get more diamonds?

708
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,010
only two members
that the spy chooses can eat.

709
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,720
The rest 5 members will lose
1 diamond,

710
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,420
and those diamonds will be given
to the spy.

711
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,040
Please turn in diamonds now.

712
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,380
- Through the hole.
- Guys, I'll turn it in.

713
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,430
- Okay.
- Come on. Let's all turn it in.

714
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,490
Let's all turn in just one.

715
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,730
- Let's all turn in just one.
- Then we can gather seven.

716
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,260
I'm turning it in right now.

717
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,320
There's 1 spy, and the others will
turn in at least 1 diamond.

718
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,740
I'll turn in two diamonds.

719
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,740
One of us won't turn in any.
It will be the spy.

720
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,440
I'll turn in two diamonds. Yes.

721
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,240
(So Min decided to turn in 2
so that they can gather 7 diamonds.)

722
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,650
(So Min who has many diamonds
turned in two diamonds.)

723
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,920
- Let's all turn in one diamond.
- I just turned it in.

724
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,450
I turned it in too.

725
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,020
I'll turn in just one diamond.

726
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,250
Let's all turn in one diamond.

727
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,550
- Turn in at least 1 diamond.
- Just 1 diamond.

728
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,120
You can turn in one diamond.

729
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,230
I'm done.

730
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,320
(They seem to have agreed
to join forces to eat the food.)

731
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
We've got this!

732
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,050
Let's have the steak together.

733
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,620
I really want to eat the steak.

734
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,430
The sizzling sound is amazing.

735
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,400
This is driving me crazy.

736
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,360
The total number of diamonds
you turned in is...

737
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,100
(The total number of diamonds
you turned in is...)

738
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,150
two.

739
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,370
- What?
- My gosh.

740
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,520
- Really?
- The difficulty level is hard.

741
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,980
- That's unbelievable.
- My gosh.

742
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,110
- No one else turned in diamonds?
- Hey!

743
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,220
- See? I told you so.
- I'll never trust you guys again.

744
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,160
- For real? That's unbelievable.
- I said we couldn't do it.

745
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,420
But we can eat the food
if we get the right answer.

746
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,620
You're right, Jae Suk.

747
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,790
I turned in my diamonds
because I thought I couldn't do it.

748
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,790
None of you turned in any diamonds.

749
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,550
Give us a multiple choice question.

750
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,590
What is the smallest country
in the world...

751
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,830
that is located in Rome, Italy...

752
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,510
where the papal court is located?

753
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,910
- What did you say?
- What?

754
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,740
What is the smallest country
in the world...

755
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,870
- that is located in Rome, Italy...
- Suddenly, I can't remember it.

756
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,010
- A country?
- where the papal court is located?

757
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,040
It has three words.

758
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,520
- Three words.
- Three words?

759
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,780
- Where?
- Se Chan.

760
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,690
You heard about it
on the TV show before.

761
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,690
- Oh, right.
- Remember?

762
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,620
Try to remember it.
It's on the border of Switzerland.

763
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,880
(What's the smallest country in Rome
where the papal court is located?)

764
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,500
- What?
- The papal court is there.

765
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,160
- Pardon?
- The papal court.

766
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,820
- The papal court.
- Where the papal court is located.

767
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,320
- All I remember is the papal court.
- Can't you give us a hint?

768
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,560
Did you say it has three words?

769
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,060
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

770
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,600
- It's not Milan, is it?
- No, that's not it.

771
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,530
Milan is not a country. It's a city.

772
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,240
- Exactly.
- I can't remember the name.

773
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,010
- Gosh.
- Wow.

774
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,070
- Why can't I remember it suddenly?
- Can't you remember it?

775
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,270
My gosh. I can't remember it at all.

776
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,810
Jae Suk, you're suspicious.
You can't remember it suddenly?

777
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,250
I'm not lying.
I suddenly forgot the name.

778
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,960
There are times when you can't
remember what you know.

779
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,520
- We'll give you 5 seconds.
- It has 3 words?

780
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
- I don't think this is correct.
- Five.

781
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,260
- Why didn't you turn in diamonds?
- Four.

782
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,590
(She wrote "In Rome?")

783
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,430
- Three.
- I don't know. I can't remember it.

784
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,790
- Two.
- It's confusing.

785
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,790
One.

786
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,630
- Isn't it Brussels?
- Show your answers now.

787
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,700
Isn't it Brussels?

788
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
(Everyone reveals their answers
without confidence.)

789
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,770
Gosh.
I wrote this to make everyone laugh.

790
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,630
(Suriname)

791
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,830
(Papal court)

792
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,040
- I can't remember it.
- Is this a capital city?

793
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,100
All the members...

794
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,920
- didn't get the correct answer.
- Gosh, seriously.

795
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,080
- It was too difficult.
- I couldn't remember the name.

796
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,250
It was too difficult.

797
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,310
- Hey, Florence is a city.
- Really? I didn't know.

798
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,960
- Hey, isn't it Brussels?
- I don't know.

799
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,520
- Isn't it Monaco?
- What are you talking about?

800
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,090
- Monaco is a kingdom.
- Isn't it Monaco?

801
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,790
- She said it was a country.
- The answer is Vatican City State.

802
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,360
- Vatican City State.
- Oh, Vatican City State?

803
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,590
- Oh, Vatican City State?
- Vatican City State?

804
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,790
- Vatican City State.
- Oh, it was Vatican City State.

805
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,530
- Why couldn't I remember this?
- Vatican City State.

806
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,170
- Why couldn't I remember it?
- Hey.

807
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,940
- She wrote "In Rome."
- You wrote "Monaco."

808
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,040
They wrote "In Rome,"
"Brussels," and "Papal court."

809
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
- Suk Jin, you wrote "Monaco."
- Yes?

810
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,870
- "Monaco?"
- What's that?

811
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,450
- Big Nose wrote "Monaco."
- I got confused.

812
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,220
- But I think...
- It's Vatican City State, right?

813
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,150
It wasn't as hard as I expected.

814
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,490
- Right? When you heard it...
- Yes, we've all heard it before.

815
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,490
- It's not that hard.
- Right.

816
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,260
But one of you could have given
the wrong answer intentionally.

817
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,430
- Of course. I think it's her.
- I'm sure of it.

818
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,850
- No, I didn't know the answer.
- You think she knows the answer?

819
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,850
I don't even know
Vatican City State.

820
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,260
- Wait. Hold on.
- The spy is...

821
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,820
There's no way he doesn't know
Vatican City State.

822
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,020
- I agree.
- Hear me out.

823
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,440
- I couldn't remember the name.
- Jae Suk must know the answer.

824
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,970
- Hold on. Vatican City State...
- Let me explain.

825
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,130
- I mean, I'm sure that...
- I couldn't remember it.

826
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,440
it's an easy question for him.

827
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,770
Jong Kook, I find something
even stranger than that.

828
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,750
- He didn't write anything.
- It's because...

829
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,340
- Nobody leaves it blank.
- That's right.

830
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,150
- He's an experienced entertainer.
- I mean...

831
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,570
I couldn't write a wrong answer
because...

832
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,520
But he knows all the capital cities.

833
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,720
- Yes, I know all of them.
- He's the spy.

834
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,020
- He's the spy.
- No, I'm not.

835
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,050
- Diamonds...
- I wouldn't have made it obvious.

836
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,020
Listen.
Let me share my sharp thinking.

837
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,790
It could be him,
but this is a quiz game, right?

838
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,700
So it must be someone who's expected
to give a wrong answer. One of them.

839
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
You think it's me?

840
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,230
We wouldn't find it suspicious
if one of them got it wrong.

841
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,900
- Aren't I right?
- Wait.

842
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,090
- But...
- Hold on.

843
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,630
I think it's either
Jae Suk or Se Chan.

844
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,600
- It's odd he didn't write anything.
- That's not it.

845
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,240
- That's the weirdest part.
- That's because...

846
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,740
He would know Vatican City for sure.

847
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,980
- Vatican...
- It wasn't puzzling.

848
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,610
- I know, but I drew a blank.
- That's not it.

849
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,980
Nothing came to mind.

850
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,520
- It's just odd.
- When you're the Variety King?

851
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,780
- You wrote nothing.
- Well, he...

852
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,720
- It's dereliction of duty.
- It doesn't make any sense.

853
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,350
How can he not write anything
when he's a veteran of 35 years?

854
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,350
- Hold on.
- I'm sure of it.

855
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,120
Let's get ourselves
an easier one first.

856
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,230
- That's right.
- Yes, an easier one.

857
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,820
- Vatican City wasn't easy.
- Let's hand in our diamonds.

858
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,790
- And...
- Let's fish out the spy.

859
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,530
- One who doesn't hand in one.
- Right.

860
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,790
- Two each...
- It only just came back to me.

861
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,060
Hold on a second.

862
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,300
- It's ready.
- First of all,

863
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,480
since you didn't
answer the question correctly,

864
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,650
only the two chosen by the spy
will get to eat.

865
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,680
- This looks incredible.
- The two chosen by the spy are...

866
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,870
(Who did the spy choose?)

867
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,110
- Suk Jin?
- So Min and Haha.

868
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,850
- Why though?
- One of them is the spy.

869
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,660
- It's not me.
- One of them is the spy.

870
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,200
- The spy chose himself or herself.
- It's So Min.

871
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,660
- No, the spy wouldn't do that.
- Is that so?

872
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,730
(It's him!)

873
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,120
So the spy is among us?

874
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,430
- Of course.
- It isn't me.

875
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,090
- It's Jae Suk.
- I know Vatican City, but...

876
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,470
There's no way
you wouldn't know that.

877
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,940
- You sometimes draw a blank.
- The spy could've chosen himself.

878
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,130
- Because...
- Himself?

879
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,370
Can I tuck in?

880
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,480
- Yes, go ahead.
- Right here?

881
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,340
(A juicy steak grilled with butter)

882
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,650
- This looks great.
- Is this Korean beef?

883
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,420
- What?
- What about stir-fried pork?

884
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
(A juicy steak grilled with butter)

885
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,310
It's medium-rare.

886
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,780
This looks incredible.
I'll enjoy this.

887
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,880
(Thanks to the spy, Haha and So Min
enjoy the T-bone steak.)

888
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,550
Are we really allowed to eat this?

889
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,490
(They forget about the spy
and enjoy their meal.)

890
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,820
Check this out.

891
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,590
This is insane.

892
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,500
It's so good.

893
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,020
You grilled it to perfection.

894
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,700
- Could the spy love me?
- Maybe me as well.

895
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,100
Why is the spy being nice to us?

896
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,300
Am I being pitied?

897
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,540
- From what I see...
- So Min.

898
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,270
- Look.
- That looks delicious.

899
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,980
It's weird that Haha's there.

900
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,340
Haha didn't know the answer,

901
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,780
so he could've just
written his name instead.

902
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,520
- But those two?
- Let's hand in some diamonds.

903
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,820
- I wonder who chose them.
- We'll hand in diamonds this time.

904
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,120
You failed to answer
the question correctly,

905
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,550
so they got to enjoy the steak.

906
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,860
- The others lost a diamond each.
- Exactly.

907
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,030
- We were going to lose them anyway.
- The spy will receive the diamonds.

908
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,900
Apart from those eating,
we all lose a diamond each.

909
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,440
So the spy gets five diamonds?

910
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,410
Before we move on to the next round,

911
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,650
you will be given a mission
that'll help guess who the spy is.

912
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,680
The winner of that game...

913
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,370
will get to see their current rank
or someone else's.

914
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,220
It could help you determine
who the spy is.

915
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,450
(The spy must finish in 3rd place!)

916
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,050
This game will get you partying,

917
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,260
and it's called
Mr. Run, Do You Know the Song?

918
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,320
What was that again?

919
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:01,500
Each of you will select a year
between 1995 and 2022.

920
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,740
A popular song
from that year will play.

921
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,670
When the song pauses,

922
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,710
you are to continue with the song.

923
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,060
- I see.
- I get it.

924
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,340
The one who chose the year
will get a chance to sing it first.

925
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,570
You will win two points
if you succeed in your round.

926
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,980
If you fail,
the mic will be up for grabs,

927
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,840
and it will be worth one point.

928
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,780
Get it wrong,
and you'll lose a point.

929
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,990
(Get it right to win a point,
Get it wrong and lose a point)

930
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,810
Let's start with the 90s.

931
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,520
From 1998 to 2000.

932
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,380
- I hardly listened to songs then.
- The early 2000s.

933
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,090
I'm starting with 1995.

934
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,500
Knowing the song
and being able to sing it...

935
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,000
- are two different things.
- Exactly.

936
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,060
Is it going to be
just a popular song,

937
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,360
or one that topped the charts?

938
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,530
It'll be one from the top ten list.

939
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,800
How about 2005?

940
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,210
- Back when I was 20?
- Yes.

941
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,340
- I'll go with 2005. When I was 20.
- You listen to a lot of music...

942
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,800
- in your teens and your early 20s.
- Right.

943
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,980
Let it be an easy one.

944
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,250
Is this the one?

945
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,280
- I know the song. It's by Buzz.
- Yes, Buzz.

946
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
- I know the song. It's by Buzz.
- Yes, Buzz.

947
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,930
Is this "Thorn?"

948
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,990
- Is this "Thorn?"
- Widened eyes

949
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,430
No, not now. When the song pauses.

950
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,660
When it pauses.

951
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,230
Follow the lyrics
and listen to the song.

952
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,560
I know there is only one of you

953
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,800
- I don't know this song very well.
- It's why I want you no matter what

954
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,570
- I don't know this either.
- It goes, "Don't make me cry."

955
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,130
I know the song, but not the lyrics.

956
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,340
- Love me
- It was, "Love me."

957
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,650
Don't make me cry

958
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,080
More often said than breathing

959
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,880
(More often said than breathing)

960
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,260
Than breathing

961
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,190
- I almost had it.
- What happened?

962
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,460
- The rest of it.
- It's not as easy as it looks.

963
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,620
- I never sang along to this song.
- Me neither.

964
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,900
I don't know songs by Buzz.

965
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,740
I never sang them
since I don't like Min Kyung Hoon.

966
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,970
Because you didn't like him?

967
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,210
- Not now though, right?
- We're close friends now.

968
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,330
Give it a try if you know the song.

969
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,870
- Anyone?
- Sing that part.

970
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,370
I don't know the lyrics.

971
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,250
(It's a song many have sung before.)

972
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,570
I know I'm right.

973
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,040
- Love me
- Love me

974
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,190
- Don't make me cry
- Don't make me cry

975
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,520
- Words more often said
- Words more often said

976
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,820
- Than breathing
- What is it?

977
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,160
Than breathing

978
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,290
But I can't say it with confidence

979
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,230
All I do is hide my feelings

980
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,170
- That's the kind of coward I am
- That's the kind of coward I am

981
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,670
(All I do is hide my feelings,
that's the kind of coward I am)

982
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,900
(Se Chan is correct!)

983
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,610
- It came to you.
- Right, it came to me.

984
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,210
- But...
- You sang that really well.

985
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,670
- Really?
- You only get one point though.

986
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,840
If it were your first try,
you would've gotten two.

987
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,380
Still, it came to us.

988
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,980
You need help from those around you.

989
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,020
- A coward
- The help is crucial.

990
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,320
This is tricky.

991
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,550
I'm completely clueless.

992
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,230
Did you say from the 90s?

993
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,650
Ji Hyo, have you ever...

994
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,150
gone to a karaoke before?

995
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,150
No, that's why I'm...

996
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,530
Before she does anything,

997
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,860
- she always seemed worried.
- Let me see.

998
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,360
- The 2000s? 2002.
- How about 2000?

999
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,130
- Just choose a random year.
- The year 2002.

1000
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,360
- "Oh! Pilsung Korea" could play.
- It's a possibility.

1001
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,610
She doesn't know that song.

1002
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,670
- "Oh! Pilsung Korea?"
- I don't.

1003
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,730
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1004
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,800
It's BoA's song.

1005
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,170
("No.1" by BoA)

1006
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,550
- It's BoA's song.
- You shined a light

1007
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,280
- It's "No.1."
- I know this song.

1008
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,650
You saw me when
my relationship ended

1009
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,980
You're still my number one

1010
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,590
Don't look for me

1011
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,030
Take my sadness away

1012
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,960
Up in the clouds

1013
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,000
It's not as easy as it seems.

1014
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,670
I feel my number one

1015
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,170
- I'm still my number one
- I can't recall the lyrics.

1016
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,710
- Don't look for me
- Don't look for me

1017
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,900
- Isn't it "deep inside me?"
- I don't know.

1018
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,000
- Don't look for me
- Don't look for me

1019
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,900
- Even my sadness
- Don't look for me

1020
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,320
(Humming meaningless syllables)

1021
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,380
What on earth was that?

1022
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,650
- I'll take a shot at this.
- You're still my number one

1023
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,690
Why are you up there?

1024
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,960
I know the song.

1025
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,250
As if.

1026
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,960
- Let him try.
- I bet he'll fail.

1027
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,230
(You saw me when
my relationship ended)

1028
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,630
Don't look for me

1029
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,000
To me, you

1030
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,670
- Are you kidding me?
- That was awful.

1031
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,800
- What was that?
- Are you the spy?

1032
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,130
- I suddenly drew a blank.
- I'm sorry to say this but...

1033
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,900
Suk Jin, you lose a point.

1034
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,500
Why?

1035
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,670
- You lose points.
- So just stay put.

1036
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,380
You lost a point for running wild.

1037
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,610
- You lose points for trying.
- He wanted to seem young.

1038
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,650
- But...
- See?

1039
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,070
That's what you get
for wanting more screen time.

1040
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,380
I should've got to sing
from "I feel my number one."

1041
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,920
It's "You still my number one."

1042
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,710
It's not "I feel." It's new...

1043
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,550
- You still my number one?
- This seems impossible.

1044
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,550
Don't look for me

1045
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,320
- Secretly
- Secretly

1046
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Little by little, I cried

1047
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,690
- Jae Suk, go for it.
- And I

1048
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,400
Finally

1049
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,500
We'll move on to the next song.

1050
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,880
What the...

1051
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,340
- But I just went up there.
- Can't you give him a chance?

1052
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,480
How about this?

1053
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,170
- We should...
- Jae Suk,

1054
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,420
how about 1998?

1055
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,440
- Maybe a song by H.O.T.
- We'll go with a year that...

1056
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,480
- had a song many sang along to.
- Right.

1057
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
(A song many sang along to?)

1058
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,590
How about 2004 which was when
the World Cup took place?

1059
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,150
- It was 2002.
- Right, 2002.

1060
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,900
- It was in 2002 and 2006.
- Yes, 2002.

1061
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,420
During the 2002 World Cup.

1062
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,030
- Then...
- I'm going 1996, 1997, and 1998.

1063
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,530
- How about 2007?
- Sounds good.

1064
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,590
- The year 2007.
- Go for it.

1065
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,340
That's when BigBang debuted.

1066
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,130
Exactly. That's why
I mentioned 2007.

1067
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,440
- Yes, 2007.
- That sounds better.

1068
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,500
But if you think about it...

1069
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,480
- BigBang!
- It's BigBang's song.

1070
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,670
("Lies" by BigBang)

1071
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,300
- It's BigBang.
- Is this "Lies?"

1072
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,980
- Here we go.
- He doesn't know the lyrics.

1073
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,250
- This is "Lies."
- Lies

1074
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,650
- Late night, while it rained
- Do you know the lyrics?

1075
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,190
I don't know the rap.

1076
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,050
- I'm confident
- He listened to this a lot.

1077
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,880
Please. You've got this.

1078
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,420
(I miss you, but I can't see you,
it's over, I'll be right there)

1079
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,030
I'm so sorry, but I love you,
but they are all lies

1080
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:38,360
Only now do I know that

1081
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,900
I need you

1082
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,530
So sorry but I love you

1083
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,630
(So sorry but I love you)

1084
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,650
Seriously?

1085
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,070
Why don't you know the lyrics?

1086
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,380
He knows the lyrics,
but he can't sing to the beat.

1087
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,610
Why didn't you pause
at the section that I know?

1088
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,590
He's just as old
as everyone his age.

1089
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,820
You could tell he wasn't sure.
He went like this.

1090
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,480
I need you

1091
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,190
That's how it goes.

1092
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,730
- He even missed the beat.
- Anyway, how does it go?

1093
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,090
I thought he was going to get it.

1094
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,530
The staff have it rough.

1095
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,000
Games are always cut short,

1096
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and we don't know
the lyrics to the songs.

1097
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,530
- How does it go?
- He even missed the beat.

1098
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,340
Isn't it "sharp words in anger?"

1099
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,880
- Unknowingly, I let you go
- I let you go

1100
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,070
Go for it, Se Chan.

1101
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,400
- Give it a try.
- I think I know it.

1102
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,340
(Se Chan who can sing to the beat
gives it a try.)

1103
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,000
He'll get it this time.

1104
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,020
(I miss you, but I can't see you,
it's over, I'll be right there)

1105
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:30,250
I'm so sorry, but I love you,
but they are all lies

1106
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,320
Only now do I know that, I need you

1107
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,920
I'm so sorry, but I love you,
so the sharp words

1108
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,530
I said out of spite,
and I unknowingly let you go

1109
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,130
- I'm so sorry
- Yes!

1110
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,820
- Yes!
- Nice!

1111
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,800
- Come on!
- But...

1112
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,090
- I thought I was right.
- You weren't.

1113
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,110
Don't you agree
that he looks like a hillbilly?

1114
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,800
- I mean it.
- Come on.

1115
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,670
- Haha, I'm 37, you know.
- It took me aback.

1116
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,070
Actually,

1117
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,780
- I found him really charming.
- Really?

1118
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,320
How can he be charming
when his lips were sticking out?

1119
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,610
- Ever since Yeosu...
- Exactly.

1120
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,980
- He's been growing on you.
- Well...

1121
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,880
- You found that charming?
- He sang it well.

1122
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,920
- Wasn't it good?
- Yes.

1123
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,820
I'm so sorry, but I love you

1124
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,550
He looked really ugly.

1125
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,000
- I need you
- You found that charming?

1126
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,150
He's a decent singer.

1127
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,270
Then I...

1128
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,860
Jong Kook, go with 1995.

1129
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,590
- Should I? I'll go with 1995.
- Go.

1130
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,400
If it's 1995, Turbo...

1131
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,610
("Eve's Warning" by Park Mi Kyung)

1132
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,300
It's "Eve's Warning."

1133
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,340
- Wait.
- Park Mi Kyung?

1134
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,550
He knows it.

1135
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,570
(His body reacts to the intro.)

1136
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,840
Is this not it?

1137
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,020
- It's "As if..."
- This is the move.

1138
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,210
- The dance break.
- Pull it down.

1139
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,280
- "As if."
- It starts with "today, you..."

1140
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,750
"Today, you avoid me as always."

1141
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,320
(The beat from those days
makes him excited.)

1142
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
- Today, you avoid me as always
- Today, you avoid me as always

1143
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,650
- And think about something else
- Let's go.

1144
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,360
- Kungddari hwiba
- Kungddari hwiba

1145
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,300
- You don't know the exact lyrics?
- I don't know.

1146
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,770
I know the song,

1147
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,230
but I don't know the lyrics.

1148
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,980
(Besides you, a cool guy)

1149
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,110
A cool guy

1150
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,880
- Let's go.
- Hits on me

1151
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,480
- And I'm tempted sometimes
- And I'm tempted sometimes

1152
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,250
- As if you're the only one capable
- Capable

1153
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,550
I don't know.

1154
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,480
(The old-time singer
doesn't know someone else's songs.)

1155
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,090
- What was it?
- As if

1156
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,550
- You're the only one capable
- You're the only one capable

1157
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,980
- If you're trying
- If you're trying

1158
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,360
- As if you're the only one capable
- To fool me like that, I...

1159
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,690
If you're trying to fool me
like that

1160
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,670
- Then I...
- That's right.

1161
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:27,170
- Will not be faithful anymore, I...
- Anymore, I...

1162
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,000
- There you go.
- Is this right?

1163
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,630
That's right.

1164
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,000
- So Min got one right.
- Will just leave you

1165
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,340
Songs from those days
are easier than the others.

1166
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,300
- It's much better.
- I'll do it too.

1167
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,380
I'll go with 1996.

1168
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,880
I really don't know the lyrics.

1169
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,750
- Me, neither.
- I really don't know.

1170
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,820
("Affection" by Young Turks Club)

1171
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,150
- It's Young Turks Club.
- I know it.

1172
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,320
- From the beginning.
- For our love

1173
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,360
I know it.

1174
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,800
- You said you really loved me
- You said you really loved me

1175
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,190
- You said you can't live without me
- You said you can't live without me

1176
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,770
- I believed it as the truth
- I suddenly can't remember.

1177
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,070
- You're nervous, right?
- You can't remember the lyrics.

1178
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,570
- And now, you want to break up
- And now, you want to break up

1179
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,440
(We...)

1180
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,630
We...

1181
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,750
- From the first word.
- I loved

1182
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,210
- You
- He lost.

1183
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,280
Do you think you know it?

1184
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,440
- You said you really loved me
- You said you really loved me

1185
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,960
- You said you can't live without me
- You said you can't live without me

1186
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,480
- I believed it as the truth
- I believed it as the truth

1187
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,190
- She knows it.
- And now, you want to break up

1188
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,030
(What about...)

1189
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,690
- What about
- What?

1190
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,030
- "What about me?"
- No.

1191
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,070
- Is it not right?
- No.

1192
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,960
- That's the chorus.
- What really angers me...

1193
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,780
is that they play
the part we know only.

1194
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,250
You can't let us guess
the part many people don't know.

1195
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,070
I'll let you know the first line.

1196
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,110
- Okay.
- Okay.

1197
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,710
- "What about the remaining love?"
- Yes.

1198
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,280
- What about the remaining love?
- What about the remaining love?

1199
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,250
- What about our memories?
- What about our memories?

1200
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,090
- When I cry because I miss you
- "When I cry..."

1201
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,000
- And now...
- And now, you want to break up

1202
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,650
- No.
- You want to break up

1203
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,300
- No.
- It doesn't make sense.

1204
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,530
- It's the chorus.
- What...

1205
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,630
- What about me...
- No, it's not.

1206
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,900
- It's "without you."
- It's "What about remaining love?"

1207
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,000
- How can I live without you?
- How can I live without you?

1208
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,280
(They just told him the lyrics
"What about remaining love?")

1209
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,940
- How can I live without you?
- It's "remaining love."

1210
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,980
- What about remaining love?
- What about remaining love?

1211
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,170
- What about without memories?
- It's "Be happy without you."

1212
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,090
- When I cry because I miss you
- When I cry because I miss you

1213
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,920
- And now, you want to break up
- When I cry...

1214
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,380
- because...
- Is this a repeating song?

1215
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,530
- When I cry because I miss you
- Because I miss you

1216
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,360
- Now, what should I do?
- No.

1217
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,000
- No.
- Now...

1218
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,030
Isn't it "What should I do now?"

1219
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,300
- No. That's not the part.
- What on earth should I do?

1220
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,070
- It's "What on earth should I do?"
- "What on earth should I do?"

1221
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,800
- What on earth should I do?
- Should I do?

1222
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,780
- No, it must be a dream
- Must be a dream, I can't forget

1223
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,440
- It's "What on earth should I do?"
- Okay, I got it.

1224
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
- Try it.
- "What on earth should I do?"

1225
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,520
- I really hope it's right.
- Jae Suk...

1226
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,920
- will get nervous 100 percent.
- But is it right...

1227
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,820
- for us to cheer each other up?
- Go.

1228
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,050
- Good. Go.
- We should get it right first.

1229
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,590
Jae Suk, sing it loud.

1230
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,360
(Will he be able to finish the song,
overcoming his game anxiety?)

1231
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,280
- You said you really loved me
- You said you really loved me

1232
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,440
(You said you can't live without me)

1233
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,550
I'm nervous again.

1234
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,480
(I believed it as the truth)

1235
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,610
It's "remaining love."

1236
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,880
(And now, you want to break up)

1237
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,690
- What about remaining love?
- Remaining love?

1238
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:32,090
- What about our memories?
- What about our memories?

1239
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,340
- When I cry because I miss you
- When I cry because I miss you

1240
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,530
- What on earth should I do?
- What on earth should I do?

1241
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,340
- That's right.
- Is this right?

1242
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,230
- No, it must be a dream
- It must be a dream

1243
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,650
- I can't forget you
- I can't forget you

1244
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:47,670
I miss those days.

1245
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,670
- It was nice.
- But is it right for us...

1246
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,420
to cooperate
and make one of us succeed?

1247
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,520
- Is it an individual game or what?
- It's not right, but...

1248
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,610
- It's an individual match, but...
- It's a warm-up.

1249
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,520
- It puts us in a good mood.
- Is that so?

1250
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,280
- Yes. It puts us in a good mood.
- I worked so hard.

1251
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,960
- Here we go.
- Gosh.

1252
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,190
(The song mission that feels like
a get-together continued like that.)

1253
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,400
"I went."

1254
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,320
- I went around a fishy quayside
- I went around a fishy quayside

1255
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,070
- Is this "Challenge 1000 Songs?"
- As if it was my world

1256
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,190
(Acting like a thug)

1257
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,270
It's sung by Can.

1258
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,300
Yes, I know.

1259
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,230
- With my two fists
- Let's go.

1260
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,340
(Assistant Manager Ha
in charge of entertainment)

1261
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,780
Where?

1262
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,880
- Don't insult me that I'm cunning
- Without fear

1263
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,500
They'll play from "Don't insult me."

1264
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,610
- Don't insult me that I'm cunning
- Don't insult me that I'm cunning

1265
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,940
Even if I wander

1266
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,550
- Come on. Move over.
- around dirty backstreets

1267
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,820
- You were late.
- I'll do it.

1268
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,050
I'm doing it.

1269
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:36,050
It's my first time I finally

1270
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,320
I don't sing this part.

1271
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:45,400
- We should guess this part.
- Fell deeply in love

1272
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,130
You should've played
the previous part.

1273
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,980
Why did you...

1274
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,380
But wait.

1275
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,480
Based on the result,
the winner is Se Chan.

1276
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,190
- As expected.
- You should come...

1277
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,980
and ask us about the rank
of the person you're curious about.

1278
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,150
- Then we will answer.
- This is...

1279
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,880
No. The spy could work hard.

1280
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,880
- Why?
- You can ask about yourself...

1281
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
or someone else.

1282
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,190
- I'm not a spy.
- If he's a spy, he worked hard...

1283
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,300
to hide his identity.

1284
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,860
- Right. To hide his identity.
- Sit down.

1285
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,420
- That's why you worked hard.
- I said I'm not.

1286
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,920
- I can ask about 3 people?
- No. Just 1.

1287
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,570
- What?
- I said I'm not. Vatican is...

1288
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,070
- I think it's Se Chan.
- The ranking?

1289
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,300
- I'm really not.
- You can ask about yourself...

1290
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,300
or someone else.

1291
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,400
Jealous

1292
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,480
Share it with us.

1293
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,670
- We did it together.
- Think that someone was jealous

1294
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,820
Share it with us.

1295
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,420
- We did it together.
- Suk Jin.

1296
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,820
(Se Chan checks
the ranking of Suk Jin.)

1297
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,980
- Is that the one?
- This is the ranking.

1298
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,590
Really?

1299
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:46,630
- It's made.
- If it's made, the guys...

1300
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,000
- Did you see it?
- Why?

1301
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,500
- Whose ranking is the lowest?
- Why? What is it?

1302
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,940
Can I share it?

1303
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,610
- It's up to you.
- Do as you want.

1304
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,500
Share with us. We did it together.

1305
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,110
- Who did you ask about?
- Are you okay?

1306
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,980
- I'm fine. Why?
- Why do you keep pushing me?

1307
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,940
- For what?
- I think Suk Jin can slow down.

1308
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,480
- Why?
- Why?

1309
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,820
I guess he has many.

1310
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,380
- No.
- What did you ask about?

1311
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,750
- The ranking.
- What ranking?

1312
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,150
The gem ranking.

1313
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,420
I guess he doesn't have a lot.

1314
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:11,130
Be quiet.

1315
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,360
- Does he have nothing?
- He checked the ranking.

1316
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,250
- We'll reveal the next food.
- My stomach hurts.

1317
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:17,690
What ranking is it?

1318
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,420
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- What ranking is it?

1319
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,230
I was thrilled
to guess all the lyrics right.

1320
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,730
What is it this time? Noodles?

1321
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,300
Is it noodles? It's ramyeon.

1322
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,610
- No. It's ramyeon.
- It's ramyeon. It's crazy.

1323
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,610
(Crowding)

1324
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,300
- Let's eat it no matter what.
- I'll definitely hand it in.

1325
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,650
- We should do it.
- Let's do it.

1326
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,670
- Let's do an easy one and hand it.
- It's a snow crab.

1327
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,380
It's a snow crab.

1328
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,520
Full of umami.

1329
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,610
- This is a must.
- It's seafood.

1330
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:46,030
Regardless of it,
let's give them two.

1331
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,360
- But, Jae Suk...
- Let's give them two.

1332
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:50,960
I think one of us should
give them more.

1333
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,300
It's the spy
who hasn't given anything.

1334
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:54,840
Oh, someone can't afford it?

1335
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,000
- So...
- Is it...

1336
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,710
- impossible to give it to them?
- So one of us should be confident.

1337
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:00,730
- I got it.
- Excuse me.

1338
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:01,780
- I'll give them 2 this time.
- You should give them 2.

1339
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,440
- Rich people should give 2.
- Give them 2.

1340
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,380
- I'll give them 2.
- I'll give them 1.

1341
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,670
Wait. Then we can deduce.
Let's exclude him first.

1342
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,750
- Then the ones who don't give...
- One, two, three,

1343
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,020
four, five, six, and seven.

1344
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,710
- Jae Suk will not give them his.
- Who is going to give them two?

1345
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:13,780
I'll give them two.

1346
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,980
- I'll give them two this time.
- Yes. Give them two.

1347
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,980
- Then it should be eight.
- It'll be obvious.

1348
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,230
I'll give them exactly two
this time.

1349
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,090
- Let's make it 8.
- If we make it 8,

1350
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,730
- we can check it.
- Okay.

1351
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,090
- Okay. Go in.
- Okay.

1352
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,960
- The spy is going to be revealed.
- Go.

1353
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,070
- Go inside and close the door.
- I'll trust you guys this time.

1354
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,130
I'll take out two this time.

1355
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,500
- One?
- Let's make it.

1356
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,900
- Are you a beggar?
- He's a genius.

1357
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,780
- Take it out, okay?
- Hey.

1358
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,130
I think
Suk Jin doesn't have anything.

1359
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,940
I won't have to give them mine.

1360
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,750
They think I have nothing.

1361
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,750
I do have some.

1362
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,420
Not giving it to them
is meaningless.

1363
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,280
Let's find the spy.

1364
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,320
Not giving it to them
is meaningless.

1365
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:53,150
If you don't give it to them,
they will take it anyway.

1366
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,650
(More than 7 gems: Easy,
Between 4 and 6 gems: Normal,)

1367
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,730
I'll take out two.

1368
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,130
- Okay. Let's get the easy one.
- Let's go.

1369
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:01,130
- Let's go.
- Before the second quiz,

1370
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,500
take out the diamonds
to decide the difficulty level.

1371
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,570
I'll really trust you.

1372
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:08,800
I'll give them mine too.

1373
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,630
But you don't have any.

1374
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,520
(Retrieving)

1375
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,380
(Sealing in the pocket
without anyone knowing)

1376
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,650
I'm really going to hand it in.

1377
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,750
I'm handing it in this time.

1378
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,980
I submitted.

1379
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,380
(Jae Suk submitted 2
as he promised.)

1380
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,500
(So Min also promised to submit 2.)

1381
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,170
Jae Suk. I submitted two.

1382
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,610
I'm handing it in.

1383
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,500
Let's go.

1384
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,880
We have to find the spy,
so let's hand it in.

1385
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,110
I already did.

1386
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,610
Let's check our teamwork.

1387
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,340
You submitted a total of...

1388
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,150
seven diamonds.

1389
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,780
- What?
- We did it.

1390
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,880
(They planned to collect 8,
but they only collected 7.)

1391
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,980
- Someone didn't submit it.
- This question is easy.

1392
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,230
- Who didn't submit it?
- Someone didn't submit it.

1393
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,750
It's someone who had to submit one,
right?

1394
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,420
- I can't believe it.
- Gosh.

1395
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,070
The person who had to submit one
didn't submit it.

1396
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,360
- Here's the question.
- I told you.

1397
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,590
- Gosh.
- Sim Cheong...

1398
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:12,840
threw herself into the sea
to make her father open his eyes.

1399
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,940
What's the name of the sea she fell?

1400
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,340
What?

1401
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,150
(Indangsu)

1402
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,150
Easy.

1403
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,780
Of course I know.

1404
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,840
(Several members write it
without hesitation.)

1405
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,250
This isn't easy at all.

1406
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,280
This...

1407
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,050
- The sea has a name?
- This isn't easy at all.

1408
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,820
Is it Imdangsu or Indangsu?

1409
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,800
Hold on. Indangsu...

1410
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:41,940
Is this... Imdangsu?

1411
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,500
Imjeongsu? Imdangsu?

1412
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,030
What's the first letter?

1413
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,460
Isn't it Indangsu?

1414
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,380
Is it Imdangsu?

1415
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,340
(Is it Imdangsu?)

1416
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,070
- It's confusing.
- You have five seconds.

1417
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,250
Jong Kook.

1418
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,150
She sells herself for 300 sacks
of rice and throws herself...

1419
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,520
into here!

1420
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,090
- Did I remind you?
- Two.

1421
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:01,210
- One. Show your answer.
- Yes, you reminded me.

1422
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,210
(Revealing the answer)

1423
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,590
- Show your answer.
- Isn't this it?

1424
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:04,590
(Imdangsu)

1425
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:05,860
Gosh.

1426
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,280
(Imdangsu)

1427
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,090
Wait. Sim Cheong...

1428
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,090
(Imdangsu)

1429
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,360
Sim Cheong threw herself
into Imdangsu.

1430
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,400
Everyone...

1431
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,270
- Probably not.
- did not get it right.

1432
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,030
- Gosh.
- I knew it.

1433
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,230
(They failed to get the answer.)

1434
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,400
- Who was it?
- Who was it?

1435
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,400
- Jae Suk.
- I knew it.

1436
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,110
- Isn't this Indangsu?
- But...

1437
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,170
- It's Indangsu.
- Indangsu.

1438
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,170
- Is it In or Im?
- He got it.

1439
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,170
- In.
- I wrote Im.

1440
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:30,780
(I wrote Im.)

1441
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,420
- Is it In or Im?
- It's Indangsu.

1442
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,980
- Indangsu.
- It's Indangsu.

1443
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,360
- It's In.
- It's not Imdangsu.

1444
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,610
I wasn't sure whether
it was In or Im.

1445
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,650
- Come here if you wrote Imdangsu.
- Imdangsu?

1446
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,230
- Imdangsu?
- I wrote Im.

1447
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:41,900
That sounds like someone's name.

1448
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,900
- I got confused.
- And...

1449
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,500
- The spelling is important.
- I told you it's not easy.

1450
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,530
- So Min. Did you submit two?
- I did.

1451
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,270
- Did you submit two?
- Yes.

1452
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,460
Then one of the people who had to
submit one is the spy.

1453
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,570
- I submitted one.
- I submitted one.

1454
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,780
- Me too.
- I submitted one.

1455
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,780
I submitted one.

1456
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,800
- Me too.
- Me too.

1457
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,070
- Haha didn't submit it.
- It's either Haha...

1458
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,340
- or Ji Hyo.
- You didn't submit it, did you?

1459
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,340
- Haha didn't submit it.
- I submitted two.

1460
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,880
It's Haha.
You didn't submit it, did you?

1461
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,480
- Is it still weird?
- You got the answer.

1462
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,480
- Yes. Indangsu.
- This is crazy.

1463
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,780
- It's Haha.
- I wrote In at first.

1464
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,250
- Haha didn't submit it.
- I submitted two.

1465
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,880
- I really submitted it.
- You didn't submit it, did you?

1466
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,480
- You don't know Indangsu?
- Look.

1467
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,480
- I wrote nieun and changed it.
- You should've stuck to it.

1468
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,630
Stop it.

1469
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,750
- Indangsu didn't sound right.
- You Empty Heads.

1470
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,400
Is it In as a person?

1471
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,270
- That's still...
- Haha didn't submit it.

1472
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,590
a lot of improvement.

1473
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,840
You only got one letter wrong.

1474
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,500
- Is it Haha?
- What?

1475
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,000
Is it Haha?

1476
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,340
I think it's either Haha or Ji Hyo.

1477
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,130
- I'm sure...
- You think so?

1478
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,670
- you'll be surprised.
- It's Haha. Haha didn't submit it.

1479
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,280
- No?
- He didn't submit it.

1480
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,570
If they submitted two each,

1481
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,570
he didn't submit it for sure.

1482
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:37,150
- I submitted two.
- What about Ji Hyo?

1483
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,520
Is it In as a human?

1484
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,590
I think so.

1485
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,380
Because not everyone got the answer,

1486
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,690
only two people the spy picked
in advance can eat.

1487
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,150
- That's me.
- But...

1488
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:50,900
If the spy knows me,
he'd let me eat for sure.

1489
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,690
The spy picked...

1490
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,000
- Probably himself.
- Not me.

1491
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,190
He probably included himself
in the second time.

1492
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,570
Yoo Jae Suk and Jeon So Min.

1493
00:51:58,570 --> 00:51:59,730
I'm eating again?

1494
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,880
(Yoo Jae Suk and Jeon So Min)

1495
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,670
I'm eating again?

1496
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,280
- Does he like So Min?
- I get to...

1497
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,480
I get to eat again?

1498
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,320
Also, except for those two,

1499
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,880
we'll collect one diamond each...

1500
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,380
- It's not you, is it?
- and give it to the spy.

1501
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,690
- It's not you, is it?
- Who likes So Min so much?

1502
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,960
It's not Ji Hyo. She doesn't...

1503
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,480
Is it Ji Hyo?

1504
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,860
It's not me.

1505
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:22,530
- Jae Suk...
- It's really not me.

1506
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,190
He said he'll submit one.
But why did he submit two?

1507
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,630
- Jae Suk. How many did you submit?
- At least three.

1508
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:27,770
- Two.
- He said he'll submit three.

1509
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,460
- You submitted two?
- Two.

1510
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,030
- Then it should be eight...
- At first, he said three.

1511
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,300
if you submitted two.

1512
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,570
So someone said he'll submit one...

1513
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,110
- You submitted one then.
- Yes.

1514
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,980
No. I submitted two.

1515
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,210
Was ramyeon not worth two?

1516
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:40,750
- Yes. So he submitted only one.
- No.

1517
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:43,520
It's not me for sure.

1518
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,520
He let me eat ramyeon.

1519
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,050
You're not the only one
who likes ramyeon.

1520
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:48,960
- I like ramyeon too.
- I like ramyeon too.

1521
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,150
- I like it more, you punk.
- I like it more.

1522
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,630
I like it more than you
no matter what.

1523
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,800
I'm crazy for ramyeon.

1524
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,690
My name is ramyeon.

1525
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,960
- Hey.
- Maybe the spy...

1526
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,500
keeps choosing Jae Suk and So Min
to frame them.

1527
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,400
- At first...
- Excuse me.

1528
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,940
- you were the spy, but...
- You have no diamonds.

1529
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,030
Stay out of this.

1530
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,960
You have no diamond?

1531
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,210
He has no diamond.

1532
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,780
- I do.
- If you don't have any, don't talk.

1533
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,340
- I do.
- Can the spy pick himself?

1534
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,340
You may eat now.

1535
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,520
I'm sorry.

1536
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,690
I'm curious. It's not that
he likes me, but frames me?

1537
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,480
- He's making fun of you.
- Am I being framed?

1538
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,050
- He's making fun of me?
- Yes.

1539
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,050
- He's making fun of you now.
- Is the spy...

1540
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,980
- Except for Jae Suk and So Min,
- Am I being framed?

1541
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,090
- give me one diamond each.
- Gosh.

1542
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,400
- This is crazy.
- We have to give it to you?

1543
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,800
Yes. You have to hand it to me.

1544
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,300
So Min. It's not you, is it?

1545
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,940
It's really not me.

1546
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,400
It's not you either?

1547
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:38,000
It's not me.

1548
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:39,960
Oh, thank you so much.

1549
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,570
Thank you for the food. Thank you.

1550
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,480
It's so savory.

1551
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,500
It's got seafood.

1552
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,670
(Savory seafood ramyeon with a crab)

1553
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,710
That looks so good.

1554
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,610
I love seafood ramyeon so much.

1555
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,190
Give me my phone.

1556
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,380
(Slurping)

1557
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,880
I love that sound.

1558
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,800
It's so refreshing.

1559
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,530
It's got the light scent of crab.

1560
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,270
On YouTube,

1561
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,610
- That looks so good.
- each broadcasting station...

1562
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,110
- has the scene of me...
- No.

1563
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:14,610
You told me to give it to the spy.

1564
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,480
- has the scene of me...
- No.

1565
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,170
(You told me to give it to the spy.)

1566
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,610
You said it's for the spy.

1567
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:21,250
(Giving the gem
to the suspected spy)

1568
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,750
- It's not me. I swear.
- The spy...

1569
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,610
must've collected
so many diamonds by now, right?

1570
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:25,980
He must've collected so many.

1571
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,150
Jae Suk. I have a feeling it's you.

1572
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,380
It could be him, right?

1573
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,550
If it's me,

1574
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,320
I wouldn't let So Min
eat twice in a row.

1575
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,380
Right.

1576
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,690
- It's him.
- That's obvious.

1577
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,500
- Yes.
- It's either him...

1578
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,500
- or...
- He can avoid the suspicion.

1579
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,770
He's trying to frame me.

1580
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:41,630
I wouldn't let Jae Suk...

1581
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,500
have ramyeon as a joke.

1582
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,030
- Wouldn't it be strange...
- He's eating because he's the spy.

1583
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,030
if the spy is eating?

1584
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:49,480
The only person who would
make this decision...

1585
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,880
is Ji Hyo.

1586
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,300
- I was thinking Ji Hyo too.
- Because she's kind?

1587
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,050
It's really not me.

1588
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,750
- Don't twist it?
- Exactly.

1589
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,840
If I was the spy, I wouldn't let
Jae Suk eat ramyeon.

1590
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,780
- Is the spy...
- What if he's the spy?

1591
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,860
- He'd eat.
- Yes.

1592
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,690
- Because he's playful.
- I'd eat too.

1593
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:06,090
Let So Min eat the steak?
I wouldn't do that.

1594
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,690
Exactly. The only person
who would let So Min...

1595
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:09,420
have the steak is Ji Hyo.

1596
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,500
No.

1597
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,770
To frame me.

1598
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,270
I didn't know it was steak
and ramyeon.

1599
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,960
- You didn't know?
- She told us.

1600
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,670
- What?
- Do you have a problem?

1601
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,170
- You didn't know.
- You didn't know it was steak?

1602
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,610
You selected them
without knowing the menu?

1603
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,440
It's not me. Don't frame it on me.
You're going to regret it.

1604
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,250
How can you not know
it was steak and ramyeon?

1605
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,250
They showed us before the start.

1606
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,980
That's not it.
She's saying she's the spy,

1607
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,480
- but without knowing the menu,
- She's the spy.

1608
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,210
- she picked them.
- She made a mistake.

1609
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,880
- But...
- That's what she meant.

1610
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,420
- Right?
- I didn't know.

1611
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,630
It's funny that she said it.

1612
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:42,090
You didn't know it was steak?
But they showed us.

1613
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,860
When?

1614
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,190
- You didn't see the T-bone steak?
- You didn't see the T-bone steak?

1615
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:47,000
No, not now.

1616
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,400
- When?
- You mean before?

1617
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,940
- Not now.
- When you received the mission?

1618
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,300
- Now...
- When you received the mission?

1619
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,300
- When you received the mission?
- They didn't tell you?

1620
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,460
- That's right.
- Okay.

1621
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,170
They didn't tell you?

1622
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:58,280
They didn't tell you the first menu?

1623
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,210
- Frame it on me.
- They only asked about who to eat.

1624
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:02,480
- Exactly.
- They didn't tell her the menu.

1625
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,880
- Okay. Frame it on me.
- When she received the mission.

1626
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,840
But if it's not me, don't regret it.

1627
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,380
- That's true.
- No.

1628
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,480
If it's not me, don't regret it.

1629
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,050
I agree with Jong Kook's opinion
because...

1630
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:13,590
You always agree
with Jong Kook's opinion.

1631
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,300
No, the only person who would
let So Min have two meals...

1632
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,150
is Ji Hyo.

1633
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,860
- Fine. Frame it on me.
- It's Ji Hyo.

1634
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,460
- But remember it's not me.
- Jae Suk too.

1635
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,030
Let's finish up the food...

1636
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,460
and move on to the next mission.

1637
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,500
We don't get to eat?

1638
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,500
No.

1639
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,570
So you should always have breakfast.

1640
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:30,800
Thank you for the food.

1641
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,880
(With suspicion,
they move for the next mission.)

1642
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:37,050
This mission is
Mr. Run, Are You Holding the Rope Tight?

1643
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:38,110
(After the second mission
to get a hint on the ranking...)

1644
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,320
One point for Jong Kook.

1645
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,590
- Minus 30...
- Gosh.

1646
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,650
Wait.

1647
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,690
There!

1648
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,050
(The last person is Ji Hyo.)

1649
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,280
- Ten points.
- Ten points.

1650
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,360
- Ten points?
- That's amazing.

1651
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,860
Ji Hyo placed first.

1652
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,630
I'll tell Ji Hyo...

1653
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:54,860
the person's ranking of her choice.

1654
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,190
What if she's the spy?

1655
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,070
- What if she's the spy?
- Whose ranking did you ask?

1656
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,230
- I think it was Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1657
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,070
- She's not the spy, is it?
- I don't know.

1658
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:09,340
I want to know my own ranking.

1659
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,110
(Ji Hyo suddenly checks
her own ranking.)

1660
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:16,380
(1st place)

1661
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,860
What's this?

1662
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,280
(Ji Hyo turns around after checking
she's in 1st place.)

1663
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,500
The spy must place within top three.

1664
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,500
(The spy must be in top 3 to win.)

1665
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,530
- It could be her.
- Top three?

1666
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,570
- Is everyone getting the penalty?
- Yes.

1667
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,840
If the spy wins,
everyone except for the spy...

1668
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,460
will get the penalty.

1669
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,730
It could be Ji Hyo.

1670
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,500
The spy has to rank in top three?

1671
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:42,280
The food for the third quiz is
beef jeon and shrimp jeon.

1672
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,880
- Shrimp jeon?
- Shrimp jeon sounds good.

1673
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,090
That's why I smelled jeon earlier.

1674
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,880
The smell of fritters is so good.

1675
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:51,520
Please enter your room
and close the door.

1676
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,980
I guess we're not getting
any food today.

1677
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,420
Please submit the diamond first
to decide the quiz level.

1678
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,500
How are we going to do it?

1679
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,090
Let's submit one each.

1680
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:01,420
- So collect seven in total.
- Let's submit one each.

1681
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,170
Same as last time.

1682
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,940
I can't submit two.
I don't have enough.

1683
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,340
The person who has more
should submit two.

1684
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:10,840
- So Min.
- This is the last time...

1685
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,210
I'll submit two.

1686
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,210
(This is the last round I submit 2!)

1687
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,340
(So Min readily submits 2 diamonds.)

1688
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,980
Two diamonds.
I submitted two diamonds.

1689
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:21,110
- Submit one each.
- Okay.

1690
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:24,150
- So Min, submit two.
- Okay.

1691
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:25,230
Hold on.

1692
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,780
Why does Suk Jin keep saying okay
when he has zero diamonds?

1693
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,920
At the very least,
seven diamonds will be collected.

1694
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:31,360
Suk Jin doesn't have any.

1695
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,400
- Hey.
- I will submit one.

1696
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,420
I submitted one.

1697
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,000
Ji Hyo, submit one.

1698
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,300
I can't do it.

1699
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,880
(Laughing)

1700
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,170
(He changed his mind in 1 second.)

1701
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,570
I don't have many diamonds.

1702
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,840
- Now, please submit the diamonds.
- Okay.

1703
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:50,650
- I will submit 1.
- I will submit 1.

1704
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,980
- I will submit 1.
- I submitted 1.

1705
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,250
The diamonds will be collected now.

1706
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:56,650
Let's go.

1707
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,420
It will be a problem
if there are less than five.

1708
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:00,730
We need to catch the spy.

1709
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:01,780
I submitted one.

1710
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,070
The number of diamonds
you have submitted is...

1711
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,360
- six.
- Hey!

1712
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,670
- For goodness' sake.
- I submitted one.

1713
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,300
- Six.
- Hey!

1714
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,630
- For goodness' sake.
- I submitted one.

1715
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:14,770
I swear I submitted one.

1716
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:15,800
This is...

1717
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,880
The difficulty level is normal.

1718
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,440
- We were so close.
- We were one diamond short.

1719
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,800
We were so close.

1720
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,940
- The spy didn't submit a diamond.
- It seems that way.

1721
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:24,710
I will give you the question.

1722
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,610
Who brought cotton seeds from China
during Goryeo Dynasty?

1723
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:30,820
What?

1724
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:32,750
Isn't the difficulty level easy?

1725
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,400
You should know the answer.

1726
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,300
(Answer: Mun Ik Jeom)

1727
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,030
The difficulty level is easy.

1728
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,820
(Haha writes down the answer
right away.)

1729
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,000
Hold on.

1730
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,940
(Hold on.)

1731
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,860
Is it right?

1732
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,030
Hold on. Is it Mun Ik Jeon
or Mun Ik Jeom?

1733
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,670
I am confused. Is it Jeon or Jeom?

1734
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:57,110
(Empty Heads
are struggling already.)

1735
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,380
- Hold on.
- Don't you know the answer?

1736
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,250
Hold on.
Why can't I remember the name?

1737
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,420
No way.

1738
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,780
Cotton seeds. Hold on.

1739
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,050
Who was it?

1740
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,460
(Who was it?)

1741
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,400
- Lee Bang Won?
- I will give you five seconds.

1742
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:14,320
It would make no sense
if you get this wrong.

1743
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,340
- I will give you five seconds.
- Hold on.

59:58,199 --> 01:00:00,340
- Five.
- You should know this.

1744
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:19,900
- Four.
- Hold on.

1745
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,530
- It's so easy.
- Hey!

1746
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,730
Three.

1747
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:23,980
Isn't it Lee Bang Won?

1748
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,900
- Two.
- I don't know the answer.

1749
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,380
- Who brought the cotton seeds?
- One.

1750
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,440
Raise the board.

1751
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,750
Se Chan!

1752
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,550
- I am sorry.
- Se Chan!

1753
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:33,340
Haha, the difficulty level is hard.

1754
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,320
- It isn't hard. It's easy.
- How is it hard?

1755
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,550
- I know this, but I can't remember.
- You know this, Jong Kook.

1756
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:40,650
- Cotton seeds.
- Hold on.

1757
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:41,920
- This is too much.
- Hold on.

1758
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,420
- This is too much.
- You should know the answer.

1759
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,270
Please come on out.

1760
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:47,730
- You should know the answer.
- I don't know the answer.

1761
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,960
- Really?
- Do you really not know the answer?

1762
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,530
The spy picked two members
who can eat.

1763
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:52,530
Pick me this once.

1764
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,530
They are Suk Jin and Se Chan.

1765
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,400
- I got picked.
- You finally got picked.

1766
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:57,980
- What?
- Maybe the spy picked...

1767
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,000
- random members.
- The rest of the members...

1768
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,980
- must submit one diamond each.
- Really?

1769
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,650
- The two of you can eat.
- Okay.

1770
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:08,320
- Beef jeon sounds delicious.
- My goodness.

1771
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,880
Shrimp jeon and beef jeon.

1772
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,550
The food looks amazing.

1773
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:13,420
(A table with beef jeon
and shrimp jeon)

1774
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,460
Shrimp jeon.

1775
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:16,230
It's my first time
eating shrimp jeon.

1776
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:17,800
Shrimp will be in season soon.

1777
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,690
Haha, shrimp will be in season soon.

1778
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,770
Is it tender?

1779
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:24,800
(Jealous)

1780
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:27,300
- It's insane.
- Is it tasty?

1781
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,130
- It looks delicious.
- I know.

1782
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:31,230
- Beef jeon looks tasty.
- It's insane.

1783
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,900
- I haven't had this before.
- Shrimp...

1784
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,710
- is in season.
- It's tasty these days.

1785
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:36,070
I think...

1786
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:38,920
It might be Ji Hyo.

1787
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,090
- Ji Hyo?
- One of us is a spy.

1788
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:41,750
- Seriously.
- I think it's Ji Hyo.

1789
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:42,920
I think it's Ji Hyo.

1790
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,210
Hold on. How about Jong Kook?

1791
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,480
- It could be Jong Kook.
- Think about it.

1792
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,630
I came up with a strategy earlier.
What do you think of that?

1793
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,500
- It was sharp.
- Do you honestly think it's me?

1794
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,750
You don't honestly think
it's me, do you?

1795
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,230
- But...
- You might have done it on purpose.

1796
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:53,630
You might have done it on purpose.

1797
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:54,820
- I might have done it on purpose?
- Yes.

1798
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,190
- Mun Ik Jeom.
- Mun Ik Jeom.

1799
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:59,170
- Jong Kook didn't get it right.
- I got it right.

1800
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:00,170
But Mun Ik Jeom...

1801
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:01,270
(Jong Kook didn't get
Mun Ik Jeom right.)

1802
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:02,380
I admit that it was suspicious.

1803
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,070
Although it was an easy question,

1804
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:05,480
- I couldn't remember the answer.
- It happens at times.

1805
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,110
- I really couldn't remember it.
- It happens at times.

1806
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,170
Mun Ik Jeom...

1807
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:10,340
- It might be Jong Kook.
- I admit that it was suspicious.

1808
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,750
- I admit it.
- It's very strange.

1809
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:15,190
My mind went blank.
I couldn't remember it.

1810
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,250
I couldn't remember it.

1811
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,750
Why couldn't I remember Mun Ik Jeom?

1812
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:20,480
It's so tasty.

1813
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,400
- I got Mun Ik Jeom right.
- Suk Jin, that's mine.

1814
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,300
- No. You had two.
- I got it right too.

1815
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,770
- What?
- You had two.

1816
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,130
- I had one.
- Really?

1817
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:28,730
As for the shrimp jeon,
I had 2 and you had 1.

1818
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:29,900
- You are right.
- Yes.

1819
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,400
I couldn't remember it.

1820
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,840
(He divided
the beef jeons precisely.)

1821
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,860
- You were counting.
- Of course.

1822
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:34,960
What?

1823
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:36,880
Each person gets 2 beef jeons
and 2 shrimp jeons.

1824
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,900
I had two beef jeons.

1825
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,480
- Suk Jin was counting.
- Suk Jin said to me,

1826
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,420
"You had two beef jeons.
That's mine."

1827
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,650
Suk Jin isn't the spy.

1828
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:48,150
- He isn't. He just wanted to eat.
- He just wanted to eat.

1829
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,550
It's so tasty.

1830
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,050
- Suk Jin, you are cute.
- He is so cute.

1831
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,090
My goodness.

1832
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:55,130
- It's so tasty.
- But the spy...

1833
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:58,130
excluded me on purpose.

1834
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,000
- It's strange.
- It's strange.

1835
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,900
- Ji Hyo is...
- Ji Hyo, aren't you the spy?

1836
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,340
- I am not the spy.
- You are a strong candidate.

1837
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,030
Go ahead and vote for me then.

1838
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,630
- But I am not the spy.
- We are making deductions.

1839
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:09,880
- We need to catch the spy.
- But...

1840
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,900
- if...
- I can see your shadow, you punk!

1841
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,300
- Gosh.
- You startled me.

1842
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:14,900
You startled me.

1843
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,820
(Haha suddenly got scolded.)

1844
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,750
What was that?

1845
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,440
I thought you were swearing at me.

1846
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,250
(Haha got caught right away.)

1847
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:25,020
My teacher, Ms. Lee Yeong Ja
did that back in elementary school.

1848
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:27,130
- I apologize for swearing.
- Ms. Lee, are you doing well?

1849
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,150
- I was so angry.
- It wasn't too bad.

1850
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:30,420
The light was on him.

1851
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,090
- He didn't know that.
- The light was on him.

1852
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:34,170
- You saw his shadow.
- You can see it.

1853
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,460
I can see it.

1854
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,030
"I can see your shadow, you punk!"

1855
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,570
- Are you done with the food?
- Yes.

1856
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,730
Now comes the last mission
for a hint on the ranking.

1857
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:45,610
These are real lottery tickets.

1858
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:49,520
The one who wins the highest amount
of money will be the winner.

1859
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,070
That person will learn
another member's ranking.

1860
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,590
You see the prize
at the bottom, right?

1861
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:53,940
You just need to get
the matching number.

1862
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:56,210
- I got a dud.
- Here.

1863
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,750
Let me get one.

1864
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,480
- I got one.
- How much is that?

1865
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:00,730
- It's a dud.
- It's one dollar, right?

1866
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,800
I need to get four.

1867
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,250
- Five.
- It's a dud.

1868
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,670
- It's a dud.
- One more.

1869
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:06,920
- It's a dud.
- We can't win a prize.

1870
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,070
- We can't win a prize.
- Give me another ticket.

1871
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,770
If I get 500,000 dollars,
I will share.

1872
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,500
- All right. I...
- Let's have a team dinner.

1873
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,940
- I won one dollar.
- How much?

1874
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,480
How much is the prize? One dollar?

1875
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,440
- Hold on.
- He won one dollar.

1876
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,570
- He won.
- Did you win with one dollar?

1877
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:22,050
- He won one dollar.
- I won, right?

1878
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,840
- How did you win one dollar?
- Three.

1879
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,380
No one else won one dollar.

1880
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:27,550
You can ask for anyone's ranking.

1881
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:30,150
- He is the spy.
- Whose ranking will you ask for?

1882
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,520
He is suspicious.

1883
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:34,190
I swear I am not the spy.
Don't worry.

1884
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:35,380
You don't suspect me, do you?

1885
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,630
- He is strange.
- I swear I am not the spy.

1886
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:37,690
So Min just said...

1887
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,070
- Me?
- I am not the spy.

1888
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,730
- Okay.
- So Min's eyes...

1889
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:42,670
- are shifting a lot.
- What?

1890
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,940
- I...
- You arrived early too.

1891
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,190
- Really?
- Ji Hyo was there too.

1892
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:46,570
- Do you know what's strange?
- What?

1893
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:48,270
She submitted diamonds
unlike the usual times.

1894
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:49,940
- It's unrelated.
- But...

1895
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,030
- It's her.
- I am suddenly being suspected.

1896
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:52,840
Did she get these bangs
for her role as a spy?

1897
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,340
(Did she get these bangs
for her role as a spy?)

1898
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,280
- Then I would be incredulous.
- That might be the case.

1899
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,340
- Today,
- Is this hair a must for a spy?

1900
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,090
she got those bangs
to get absorbed in the role.

1901
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,320
I am not the spy.
Don't suspect me so suddenly.

1902
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,650
Whose ranking should I check?

1903
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,280
- The spy has many diamonds.
- That's right.

1904
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,030
I can't ask you to tell me
who is in the first place, right?

1905
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,690
You can't do that.
Give me the name...

1906
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,320
- to learn his or her ranking.
- This is driving me crazy.

1907
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,320
(So Min submitted diamonds
generously today.)

1908
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,920
- So Min must be in the first place.
- Yes.

1909
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,670
So Min.

1910
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,300
Ji Hyo came early.

1911
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:19,770
I am not the spy.

1912
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:20,860
(He checks So Min's ranking.)

1913
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,530
(So Min's ranking is...)

1914
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:23,670
Really?

1915
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:27,940
(Haha returns
with a puzzled look on his face.)

1916
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,340
It's unexpected.

1917
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,570
- Why?
- Whose ranking did you check?

1918
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:33,690
- I gave So Min diamonds.
- Okay.

1919
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,190
Did you check So Min's ranking?

1920
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,820
- Is it unexpected?
- I used a lot of diamonds.

1921
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:39,590
- She doesn't have many diamonds.
- I used a lot of diamonds.

1922
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:42,030
- She isn't in the top three.
- So Min?

1923
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:43,690
- Is it unexpected?
- Then So Min isn't the spy.

1924
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,400
- So Min isn't the spy.
- Do you know why I revealed this?

1925
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,570
- So Min isn't the spy.
- No.

1926
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,860
I gave you all the information.

1927
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,360
Haha might be lying.

1928
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,270
- I meant my words.
- But his reactions came right away.

1929
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,110
- Neither So Min nor I am the spy.
- Then who is the spy?

1930
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,610
- We don't know about you.
- I am not the spy.

1931
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:57,880
I am not the spy...

1932
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,440
because I can't be in the top three
in terms of the number of diamonds.

1933
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,020
- Thus, I am not the spy. What?
- But the spy keeps getting more.

1934
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,150
But the spy keeps getting more.

1935
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:05,980
- Even if I get more...
- Perhaps you discarded some.

1936
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,650
- This could be the case.
- No.

1937
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,090
The spy needs to be
in the top three.

1938
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,550
If Suk Jin couldn't do it
despite being the spy,

1939
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,210
the production crew
might be frustrated.

1940
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:13,480
He is like a useless card.

1941
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,690
- This episode might get scrapped.
- I know.

1942
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:16,250
- This episode might get scrapped.
- "What's going on?"

1943
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:19,460
- They might be frustrated.
- "How is he so bad at this?"

1944
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:20,900
The production crew
might be frustrated.

1945
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,500
The food you can win
with the last quiz is...

1946
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:27,340
croffle and iced Americano.

1947
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,730
- I need to eat them.
- I need to eat them.

1948
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:30,130
Please bring in the items.

1949
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,840
- They will make it fresh.
- Jae Suk is the spy.

1950
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,050
It must be hot.
The croffle must be hot.

1951
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:36,880
- They brought the dough.
- Is this shine muscat?

1952
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,550
Will you spray whipped cream
on the top?

1953
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,150
- Please spray a lot.
- Okay.

1954
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:41,420
- Why? Will you eat it?
- If I get to eat it,

1955
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,590
- please add less cream.
- It's the dough.

1956
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:44,550
- She is suspicious.
- It looks delicious.

1957
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,150
- Stevia.
- She asked for a lot of cream.

1958
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:47,750
She talked as if she can eat it.

1959
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:48,920
Powder.

1960
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,530
- Do you get to decide?
- It looks so tasty.

1961
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:54,190
If you get picked, you are the spy.

1962
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,730
No way. You saw
how many diamonds I have.

1963
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,340
- I did,
- But So Min...

1964
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,730
but you could move up
to get included in the top three.

1965
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:01,360
How many diamonds
do the top three have?

1966
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,670
- She is in fourth place.
- Really?

1967
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:05,940
If she wins this round,

1968
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:08,170
- she will be included.
- In the final top three.

1969
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,170
I had a lot of diamonds,
but I used them up.

1970
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:11,750
- I used them frivolously.
- Right?

1971
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,110
- That's right.
- In that case,

1972
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:16,020
we submitted six diamonds earlier.

1973
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,250
I will submit 1 diamond.
Let's make the total 7.

1974
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,590
- It won't work.
- Submit diamonds as you did.

1975
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:23,300
- It won't work this time.
- You can submit one diamond, right?

1976
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,250
Submit diamonds as you did.
I will add one to the total.

1977
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,460
- Then we will have 7 diamonds.
- Then we will have 7 diamonds.

1978
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:29,170
Let's go.

1979
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,030
- Let's do this.
- What should we do?

1980
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:32,400
Submit diamonds as you did.

1981
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,900
- I will add 1 to the total.
- I will submit 1.

1982
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:35,340
- Will you submit a diamond?
- Of course.

1983
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,110
- I don't know about this.
- Will you submit a diamond or not?

1984
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,440
I don't think I will submit it.

1985
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,710
- No?
- Don't submit a diamond.

1986
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,940
Then our plan will be ruined.

1987
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,670
If you don't submit a diamond,
our plan will be ruined.

1988
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,750
(Will they be able
to collect 7 diamonds?)

1989
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,020
You are done thinking, right?

1990
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,650
Please submit the diamonds...

1991
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,820
that will determine
the difficulty level.

1992
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,210
It's too hard.

1993
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:55,460
- Let's submit diamonds this time.
- Someone submit three diamonds.

1994
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:58,230
Having diamonds is meaningless
unless you place first.

1995
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,690
- Jae Suk won't submit any.
- I will.

1996
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:01,690
Will you?

1997
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,030
I only have a few diamonds,
but I will do it.

1998
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:06,800
I will submit two.

1999
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,530
I will submit one.

2000
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:10,840
- I will submit 1 for real.
- I will submit 1.

2001
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,750
- Will you submit 1?
- I will submit 1.

2002
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,170
(The members shout
that they will submit diamonds.)

2003
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,250
- I submitted it.
- I will submit it.

2004
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:20,190
(If you don't submit any,
I will kill you.)

2005
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:21,380
If you don't submit any,
I will kill you.

2006
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,320
(He makes a scary promise.)

2007
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,110
- I will submit it.
- That's too much.

2008
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,550
- Jong Kook, you are scary.
- I will kill you.

2009
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:27,550
(He promises to take revenge
if they fail to meet the quota.)

2010
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:29,920
Submit one each. I just did it.

2011
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,530
- Submit it.
- Okay.

2012
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,490
- Submit it for real.
- Okay. Let's submit.

2013
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,040
Did you finish submitting diamonds?

2014
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,910
- Yes.
- The total number of diamonds is...

2015
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:44,630
(The total number of diamonds is...)

2016
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:45,870
Five.

2017
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:47,300
- Hey.
- For goodness' sake.

2018
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,740
(The total number is five.)

2019
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:52,340
(They failed to collect 7.)

2020
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,950
Who didn't submit it?

2021
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:55,880
- Who didn't submit it?
- Who was it?

2022
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,080
- Jae Suk didn't submit it.
- I did.

2023
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,230
I could tell from his face
that he wouldn't submit any.

2024
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,730
- I submitted it.
- Gosh.

2025
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,750
The difficulty level is normal.

2026
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,090
- Let's do this.
- It will be hard.

2027
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:06,400
Let's take on normal.

2028
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,460
(The difficulty level
for the last question is normal.)

2029
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,090
The difficulty level is normal.

2030
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,240
In folk religion and Taoism,

2031
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,370
there are ten things
that symbolize eternal youth.

2032
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:16,410
Excuse me?

2033
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:20,000
The sun, mountains, water, rocks,
pine trees, the moon or clouds,

2034
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,240
herbs of eternal youth, turtles,
cranes, and deer.

2035
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,540
What are these things called?

2036
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:30,190
(They write down the answer
upon hearing the question.)

2037
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:31,450
This is doable, right?

2038
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:34,620
- This is doable.
- What about the ten things? Go on.

2039
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:37,360
You know the answer, right?
The question gives it away.

2040
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,790
Give me the question from the start.

2041
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:42,120
- Haha, you are suspicious.
- I don't know the answer.

2042
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:43,490
Don't you know the answer?

2043
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:46,440
Hey, it's... Ten things.

2044
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,940
Don't give him a hint.
You have five seconds.

2045
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,200
Hold on.

2046
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,610
Five, four, three...

2047
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:54,740
Ten things?

2048
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:56,540
- Two.
- Why is everyone keeping quiet?

2049
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,710
One! Raise the board.

2050
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,690
Haha is really suspicious.
How does he not know the answer?

2051
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,910
They won't get it right.

2052
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,080
(How did the 4 younger members do?)

2053
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,450
(They failed to answer correctly.)

2054
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:11,230
It's used often.
It appears often on variety shows.

2055
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:13,230
Not everyone answered correctly.

2056
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:15,090
- For goodness' sake.
- Who was it?

2057
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,570
- Was it Haha?
- Haha.

2058
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:18,870
- This is why...
- It was easy.

2059
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:20,910
- Haha is the spy.
- It's him.

2060
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,830
It was easy.

2061
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:24,300
(Ji Hyo answered correctly.)

2062
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,440
- What did you write?
- Ten Symbols of Longevity, right?

2063
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,450
It's Ten Symbols of Longevity.

2064
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,580
- It was easy.
- I got it wrong.

2065
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:30,820
- Haha.
- "Nirvana?"

2066
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,240
- Reaching the state of Nirvana.
- "Nirvana?"

2067
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:34,120
- Why did you write "Nirvana?"
- Seriously.

2068
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,580
- Reaching the state of Nirvana.
- Don't you know the answer?

2069
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:38,020
- Why isn't it the answer?
- "Reaching the state of Nirvana?"

2070
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:41,080
(Peeking)

2071
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,250
It's Ten Symbols of Longevity.

2072
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:47,270
(Haha bursts out laughing
after reading the room.)

2073
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,870
- What did you write?
- Reaching the state of Nirvana.

2074
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,160
- I am going to go.
- Hey.

2075
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,870
- Ten Symbols of Longevity.
- He is the spy.

2076
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:52,870
- I am going to go.
- He is suspicious.

2077
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,570
- What did he write? Let me see.
- I am sorry.

2078
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:55,830
What?

2079
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:56,870
- What did he write?
- What?

2080
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,170
Haha, go.

2081
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,110
- What did he write?
- He wrote, "Ten Zodiac."

2082
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:01,610
- Go.
- For goodness' sake.

2083
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:04,210
- Don't you know the answer?
- You mean the Chinese Zodiac.

2084
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,670
- Ten Zodiac.
- I am sorry.

2085
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:07,020
I am sorry.

2086
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:08,540
Producer, I am sorry.

2087
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,320
- I am sorry. Producer, I am sorry.
- Listen.

2088
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,750
- I am going. I am sorry.
- If you don't know this...

2089
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,230
- It makes no sense.
- But I got it wrong too.

2090
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,530
It makes no sense.

2091
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:18,400
He might have gotten it confused
with the Chinese Zodiac.

2092
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,270
The question clearly said
"Ten things."

2093
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,590
I can't believe the seven of us
failed to answer correctly once.

2094
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,540
- Since I got it right, it's easy.
- Why did you write "Nirvana?"

2095
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:25,660
Reaching the state of Nirvana.

2096
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,070
- I had no idea.
- I am sorry.

2097
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:28,160
- I had no idea.
- She is suspicious too.

2098
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,370
It's one of them.

2099
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:30,630
- I am not the spy.
- How do you not know it?

2100
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:32,980
You failed to answer correctly
as the group,

2101
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:36,170
so the spy chose two people
who will eat the food.

2102
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,040
Suk Jin and So Min.

2103
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,580
- It's So Min.
- I am not the spy.

2104
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:43,080
- I am not the spy.
- Earlier, she said,

2105
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:46,360
"When you give me the croffle,"

2106
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,950
- "spray a lot of whipped cream."
- I heard that too.

2107
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:51,550
- I am not the spy.
- It's So Min.

2108
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:52,700
- This is a trap.
- She said it without thinking.

2109
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,770
- She knew she would eat.
- This is a trap.

2110
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:54,790
She said it without thinking.

2111
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:57,460
- This is a trap.
- She was like a prophet.

2112
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:00,040
She really wanted to eat it.
I told you earlier.

2113
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,700
- She...
- She chose herself.

2114
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:05,240
- She couldn't help it.
- That was why she chose Suk Jin.

2115
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:06,950
- The spy...
- No.

2116
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:09,410
- It can't be So Min.
- This is a trap.

2117
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:10,980
Do you think she did her best?

2118
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,480
The spy knows the ranking, right?

2119
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,210
She should have been included
in the top three.

2120
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:15,240
It's understandable.

2121
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,020
- Why don't you think it's her?
- But she... Listen.

2122
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:19,380
Her ranking is too low.
Think about it.

2123
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:21,360
- It isn't So Min.
- When we get a question wrong,

2124
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,380
- how many does the spy get?
- I don't know.

2125
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,490
- Five or more.
- Here is what I think.

2126
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,660
Five or more.

2127
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,730
Let's come clean.
Who gave diamonds to So Min?

2128
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:29,230
- I gave her diamonds.
- Same here.

2129
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:30,770
- I did too.
- You gave her diamonds too.

2130
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:32,160
- Then she got 15 diamonds.
- Did you give So Min diamonds?

2131
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,630
- I gave her diamonds.
- Same here.

2132
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,070
- I did too.
- You gave her diamonds too.

2133
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:36,740
- Then she got 15 diamonds.
- Did you give So Min diamonds?

2134
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,300
She got 15 diamonds.

2135
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,240
Think about it.
She got 15 diamonds from 3 people.

2136
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:42,410
Even if she submitted
two diamonds at a time,

2137
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:43,650
she would have gotten
at least five diamonds...

2138
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,910
for every wrong question
if she were a spy.

2139
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:47,240
- Then she can't be in 4th place.
- She can't be in 4th place.

2140
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,750
- She isn't the spy.
- I am not the spy.

2141
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,080
- She isn't the spy?
- I am not the spy.

2142
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,030
I got goosebumps.
Listen. She is the spy.

2143
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:57,230
- That was exactly why...
- Do you think the top two have...

2144
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:59,230
- over 26 diamonds?
- She submitted diamonds...

2145
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,460
to keep the number low.

2146
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:02,070
- She had too many.
- I didn't submit many diamonds.

2147
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,490
She isn't the type
to submit diamonds.

2148
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:04,660
Then...

2149
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:06,160
- She isn't the type to do that.
- Listen to me.

2150
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,610
- Why... What are you doing?
- Suk Jin.

2151
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,200
- Suk Jin, you are suspicious.
- What?

2152
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,080
- What?
- Why can't you accept...

2153
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,950
- a logical explanation?
- Suk Jin is suspicious.

2154
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,340
I gave diamonds
to Jae Suk and So Min.

2155
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:18,340
I gave diamonds
to Jong Kook and So Min.

2156
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,410
How about you?

2157
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,120
- You and... Yes.
- Me.

2158
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,580
- Hold on. Right.
- That's right.

2159
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,660
Then who are in the top two?

2160
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:27,380
- No!
- The top three.

2161
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,450
How many diamonds
did they start with?

2162
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:31,730
The spy has to be in the top two...

2163
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:33,330
- given the current situation.
- That's right. Of course.

2164
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,570
It's time to arrest the spy.

2165
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:37,090
Please give us another question.

2166
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:38,090
- That's right.
- I am begging you.

2167
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,330
Can't we do it here?

2168
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:40,940
Would you give a question
to each member?

2169
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,240
Please give us another chance.

2170
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,410
We can't apprehend the spy this way.

2171
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:48,110
Since you don't have a lot of hints,

2172
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:49,950
- we will give you another question.
- Okay.

2173
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:51,910
We don't have a lot of hints.

2174
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:53,120
Give us an easy question.

2175
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,790
You will learn the ranking...

2176
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:56,050
- of the person of your choice.
- Okay.

2177
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,360
We need a hint, so let's do this.

2178
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,450
Ten Zodiac.

2179
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:01,530
Let's get this right.

2180
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:03,360
This isn't my room.

2181
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,160
This isn't my room. Hold on.

2182
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,200
This isn't my room.

2183
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:08,330
Hold on.

2184
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,960
This is my room.

2185
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,110
(The owner of the room
got here late.)

2186
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,540
You startled me.

2187
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,540
Get out.

2188
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,870
Why did you enter my room?
You startled me.

2189
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,500
I thought I was mistaken.

2190
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,540
(He succeeded to tease Suk Jin.)

2191
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,670
That was so funny.

2192
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,870
It's a very easy question.

2193
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:27,190
(The difficulty level is easy.)

2194
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:28,490
Let's get it right.

2195
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:32,320
What's the 20th letter
of the alphabet?

2196
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,050
- What do you mean?
- This really hurts my pride.

2197
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:38,360
Do we need to stoop this low?

2198
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,420
What do you mean?

2199
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:44,330
- I, J, K...
- C, D, E, F, G...

2200
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:46,040
(They use fingers.)

2201
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,330
(He writes down the letters.)

2202
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:51,170
O, P, Q, R...

2203
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,080
- You have five seconds.
- Hold on.

2204
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,110
- Five, four,
- No! Hold on!

2205
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:57,170
- three,
- You have to know this.

2206
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:59,840
two, one. Raise the board.

2207
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,410
Raise the board.

2208
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,740
(Everyone submits the answer.)

2209
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,790
Raise the board.

2210
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,550
Not everyone answered correctly.

2211
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:08,730
- What?
- Really?

2212
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:12,250
(They failed to answer correctly.)

2213
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,270
- Hey.
- Who is it?

2214
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:15,460
- Hey.
- It's T.

2215
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,490
(Suk Jin, Jong Kook,
and Se Chan got T.)

2216
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:17,770
T. Did you get it wrong?

2217
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,070
I changed my answer from T to Y.

2218
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:21,130
- It's him.
- Y?

2219
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:22,660
Oh, 5 times 4 is 20.

2220
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:24,480
- Five times 4 is 20.
- It's T.

2221
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,410
Hey, 5 times 4 is 20.

2222
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:29,480
I changed my answer from T to Y.

2223
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,480
- Isn't it W?
- What is he talking about?

2224
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,490
- W.
- Jae Suk.

2225
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:35,820
- Five times 4 is 20.
- It's T.

2226
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,380
(Confused)

2227
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,250
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
- I changed my answer from T to Y.

2228
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:41,860
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q,
R, S, T.

2229
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,090
How could you get it wrong?

2230
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:45,920
How did you get W?

2231
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,370
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

2232
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:51,700
- H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P
- Hold on.

2233
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:53,870
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

2234
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:55,700
- H, I, J, K, L, M, N,
- L, M, N,

2235
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,700
- O, P, Q, R, S, T.
- O, P, Q, R, S, T.

2236
01:15:57,940 --> 01:15:59,440
- Did you get it wrong?
- The 20th letter.

2237
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,150
- Jae Suk.
- I messed up since I sang it.

2238
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,980
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G
- I wrote T down.

2239
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,670
- H, I, J, K
- What's wrong with him?

2240
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,450
- A, B, C, D, E, F
- A, B, C, D, E, F

2241
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:09,020
- Why did you count like that?
- How was I supposed to count?

2242
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:12,160
A, B, C, D, E, F, G
You should count like that.

2243
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:15,080
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G
- For goodness' sake.

2244
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:18,030
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

2245
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:20,730
H, I, J, K, L, M, N

2246
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:22,330
- Give us another chance.
- Give us another chance.

2247
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:24,490
We have no idea.
It just got more confusing.

2248
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:27,410
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G
- For goodness' sake.

2249
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,630
- It's strange that Haha ate meat...
- Who counts like that?

2250
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:30,700
in the morning.

2251
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,130
- It's Haha.
- It's strange.

2252
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:33,610
- It makes no sense...
- It's Haha.

2253
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:35,080
- that you got it wrong.
- It's Haha.

2254
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,710
- He had T at first. I heard it.
- It's Haha.

2255
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:40,340
- This is how I messed up.
- It makes no sense.

2256
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,490
Five times 4 is 20. For a second,

2257
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:45,910
I thought I needed another line.
I thought I had four lines.

2258
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:48,490
I thought I needed another line.
I swear.

2259
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:50,120
"Ten Zodiac" was suspicious too.

2260
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,230
It makes no sense
that he failed to get T.

2261
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:54,920
- I am the worst Empty Head.
- It's Haha.

2262
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:55,990
It makes no sense.

2263
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:57,990
- How did this happen?
- How did this happen?

2264
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,240
The production crew
was trying to give us a hint.

2265
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,610
- Seriously.
- They were spoonfeeding us.

2266
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:05,300
Now, the race is over.

2267
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,870
- But...
- Just take a wild guess.

2268
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:08,950
It's time to apprehend the spy.

2269
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,340
Please spread out
and vote for the suspicious member.

2270
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:13,840
I will give you the ballot.

2271
01:17:14,190 --> 01:17:15,580
Did Se Chan eat?

2272
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,950
I ate once.

2273
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:19,320
- Did you eat once?
- Yes. I had beef jeon.

2274
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:26,730
Why is no one suspecting Se Chan?

2275
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:28,070
Who? I am not the spy.

2276
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:29,590
Why is no one suspecting Se Chan?

2277
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:30,660
- Come here.
- I am not the spy.

2278
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:31,870
His name never came up.

2279
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:33,130
The innocent ones are gathered here.

2280
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:35,570
- I am not the spy.
- He isn't making deductions.

2281
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:38,800
- I swear I am not the spy.
- He isn't even trying.

2282
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,610
- He always denies it.
- You aren't the spy, are you?

2283
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:44,240
- Suk Jin.
- Ji Hyo, why are you smiling?

2284
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,620
I turned in my ballot already.

2285
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:47,740
Why did she come out smiling?

2286
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,410
Ji Hyo is so suspicious too.

2287
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,750
- I am not the spy.
- I turned it in.

2288
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,050
- Haha.
- She came out smiling.

2289
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,580
- I swear I am not the spy.
- No.

2290
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,490
- I swear I am not the spy.
- Jong Kook, I am not the spy.

2291
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:57,920
I suddenly had this thought.

2292
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,550
It's about
the production crew's intention.

2293
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:02,660
- Today, we had questions.
- Yes.

2294
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:04,770
They couldn't have chosen someone...

2295
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:05,960
- who is good at a quiz.
- That's right.

2296
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,160
- That's right.
- Haha is very fitting.

2297
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,410
He is right in the middle.

2298
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:11,130
- "Ten Zodiac" was too much.
- I know.

2299
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,170
Think of Haha's style.

2300
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:17,950
Haha would've eaten
to hide that he's a spy.

2301
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:19,240
- Of course.
- That's Haha.

2302
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,740
I know. It bothers me
that he had the first meal.

2303
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,750
- That's why I'm sure it's Haha.
- This feels strange.

2304
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,330
You think it's me when I'm not,
so I want to keep acting.

2305
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:29,660
Is it Ji Hyo
who hasn't eaten at all?

2306
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,950
- Yes.
- Ji Hyo didn't eat.

2307
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:32,160
- And Jong Kook.
- I ate.

2308
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,370
- Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.
- I didn't eat either.

2309
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:35,830
But think of her character.
If she was a spy,

2310
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:37,460
she wouldn't eat at all.

2311
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:38,940
She wouldn't write her name.

2312
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,130
- She'd give it to others?
- Yes.

2313
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:42,660
- I would've eaten the last one.
- If Haha was a spy...

2314
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,080
You know he's sly.

2315
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,800
- I would've eaten the last one.
- He would've eaten the first one.

2316
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,980
A lot of us are quite sly.

2317
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,200
Who's not sly here?

2318
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,040
- You're also sly.
- This is a variety show.

2319
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,240
- Isn't your nickname Sly Ji?
- We all are sly.

2320
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,040
- That's who we are.
- You're right.

2321
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,690
- You keep pointing me out.
- This is confusing.

2322
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,330
But I think one of those who keep
pointing me out is a spy.

2323
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,700
You say things like that
when you're a spy.

2324
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,330
- He's always like that.
- No. I never said this before.

2325
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:06,870
- Yes, you did.
- Get a grip.

2326
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:10,830
Before I take off your glasses
and slap you in the face.

2327
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,940
I think it's you.

2328
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,700
- Listen.
- I said no. This is crazy.

2329
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,540
- I'm sure that's him.
- No.

2330
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,610
- Seriously, I'm not a spy.
- The shadow.

2331
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,740
- His answer was so disappointing.
- Right.

2332
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,840
If we were a spy,
it would be too obvious.

2333
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,790
- He's just in the middle.
- I can't even say his answer.

2334
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,450
- Hang on.
- This is so upsetting.

2335
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:35,660
(Jae Suk finds out something.)

2336
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,790
It's Haha.

2337
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:38,550
- You.
- It's not those three empty heads.

2338
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:39,620
(Jae Suk approaches Se Chan.)

2339
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:41,090
No. I'm telling you it's not me.

2340
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,460
Why are you blushing?

2341
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,870
- No, I'm not.
- Look at me.

2342
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:44,960
I'm not a spy. I'm serious.

2343
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,540
- It's Se Chan.
- Se Chan, why are you blushing?

2344
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,830
I'm telling you. It's not me.

2345
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:48,830
Why can't Se Chan be a spy?

2346
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:50,740
Do you remember
when we did "Heungboojeon?"

2347
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:52,080
- No, it's not me.
- I remember.

2348
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,800
- Se Chan was...
- Seriously, I'm not a spy.

2349
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,610
- It must be Haha.
- Why are you blushing?

2350
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:58,240
(Running Man, Episode 613)

2351
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,450
(Hang on.)

2352
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:04,990
(Jae Suk saw Se Chan's face
and identified him as a spy.)

2353
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:09,450
(Jae Suk suddenly changed
his choice and suspected Se Chan.)

2354
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:11,950
(And Se Chan was the real spy.)

2355
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:15,660
(Jae Suk showed his remarkable
powers of observation.)

2356
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:18,460
- Seriously, it's not me. It's Haha.
- How many times did you eat?

2357
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:19,740
- Why are you blushing?
- Once.

2358
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,130
- Why is your face red?
- Look at his face.

2359
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,200
What did you eat?

2360
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,130
Touch my hand. It's so white, right?

2361
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:27,410
- Come here.
- I'm not nervous at all. Look.

2362
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:28,540
- Right.
- Look. I'm not sweating.

2363
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,040
No. He's sweating a lot.

2364
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,410
He's sweating even more.

2365
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,820
- It's so damp.
- It's just that...

2366
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,690
- he's not feeling well.
- I'm not a spy.

2367
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:35,740
I'm telling you it's not me.

2368
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:38,450
- No one was suspicious of Se Chan.
- This is serious.

2369
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:39,450
Because I'm not a spy.

2370
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,860
Because Se Chan...

2371
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,160
- There was nothing I could do.
- He tried his best.

2372
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,090
- It's not me.
- He did try hard...

2373
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,700
- for the song quizzes.
- Right.

2374
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,620
- Dong Hoon.
- It's not me.

2375
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:51,090
- Haha...
- I give you five seconds.

2376
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:52,090
- What do we do?
- I should go with Haha.

2377
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:53,090
(The final voting begins.)

2378
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:55,160
- Haha? Really?
- I think it's Haha.

2379
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:57,240
- Because...
- Se Chan got the quizzes right.

2380
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,780
I got all the questions right.

2381
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:01,340
Your answer was really suspicious.

2382
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,450
But this is...

2383
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:07,880
I don't know.
There's nothing we can do.

2384
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:10,620
If I get it wrong again,
that means I don't know you guys.

2385
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,950
I'll feel betrayed.

2386
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,730
Gosh, the real spy
must be really thrilled now.

2387
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:16,360
- The results are in.
- This is crazy.

2388
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,420
- Okay.
- I don't know.

2389
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:19,420
Haha got five votes,

2390
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,270
- and he's chosen as a spy.
- My goodness.

2391
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:23,590
- We had no choice.
- I'm sorry, Haha.

2392
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:26,270
Ji Hyo got the other two votes.

2393
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:27,270
- Okay.
- It can't be helped.

2394
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:29,980
First, Haha, bring your mission bag.

2395
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,910
I'm not a spy.
It must be filled with gems.

2396
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,950
Haha is chosen as a spy.

2397
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:37,950
(Haha is chosen as the spy suspect.)

2398
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:40,820
Open your bag as I count to three
and reveal your identity.

2399
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,450
- I hope it's him.
- I'm not sure though.

2400
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:43,790
- I hope he's the spy.
- I don't know.

2401
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:46,450
- I have no idea.
- The spy's bag says spy on it.

2402
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:47,620
- Really?
- Does it say that?

2403
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,660
(The spy's bag has
the spy's name tag on it.)

2404
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,950
- What about gems?
- Please.

2405
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:51,090
(Please.)

2406
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:52,790
- Please.
- One.

2407
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:53,870
- I bet he has many gems.
- Please.

2408
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:54,900
Two.

2409
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,940
(Haha gave a lot of wrong answers.)

2410
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:04,800
(What's Haha's identity?)

2411
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,130
- I bet he has many gems.
- Please.

2412
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,200
Two.

2413
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:08,800
Three.

2414
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,780
(Revealing his identity)

2415
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:12,980
No?

2416
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,340
Was it that obvious?

2417
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:17,250
(Was it that obvious?)

2418
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,690
Was it that obvious?

2419
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,450
No?

2420
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:22,660
(There's no name tag?)

2421
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,090
He has no gems?

2422
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:28,160
(Haha isn't the spy.)

2423
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,960
He has no gems?

2424
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,570
- He has a lot.
- A lot?

2425
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:32,570
He has a few, but that's not a lot.

2426
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:35,160
You should've insisted
that you weren't a spy.

2427
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:36,700
Why did you...

2428
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,940
You should've insisted
that you weren't a spy.

2429
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,870
(Flustered)

2430
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:43,450
- This is driving me crazy.
- Hey.

2431
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:45,520
- Haha.
- You should've insisted harder.

2432
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,710
I'm sorry,
but I knew it wasn't Haha.

2433
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:49,950
Hey, why were you alone there...

2434
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:50,990
when we were discussing?

2435
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:52,320
- I said it wasn't him.
- Haha.

2436
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,360
Didn't I tell you?

2437
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,880
What was "Ten Zodiac" for?

2438
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,900
- What was that?
- I racked my brains...

2439
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,660
to come up with that.

2440
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:02,570
- Seriously...
- You failed to catch the spy.

2441
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:05,160
- Today's spy was...
- Who is it?

2442
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,460
(Today's real spy is...)

2443
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,420
- Yang Se Chan.
- Yes!

2444
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:19,160
I told you so.

2445
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,260
- I saw his face.
- Bang!

2446
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,660
- Yang Se Chan.
- Yes!

2447
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,800
(I saw his face)

2448
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,260
(I told you so.)

2449
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:30,170
(Jae Suk almost caught the spy
again by looking at the face.)

2450
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:31,840
- It was Yang Se Chan.
- Hang on.

2451
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,100
(Se Chan managed to clear
himself of suspicion.)

2452
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:38,670
I'm out of breath.

2453
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:42,600
(When he got the gems
at the beginning of the race...)

2454
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:48,340
(Yang Se Chan, you are a spy
with 0 gems.)

2455
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:51,790
(If you make the top 3 without
getting caught, you win.)

2456
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:56,420
(This is how
Spy Yang Se Chan survived.)

2457
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:03,260
(1. He didn't send in gems
to make the questions difficult.)

2458
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:04,300
(Relieved)

2459
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:10,470
(2. He doubted the other members
whenever he had a chance.)

2460
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:19,310
(3. He let So Min eat 3 times
so the suspicion fell on her.)

2461
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:22,920
(But Spy Yang faced a crisis.)

2462
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,050
(1st crisis:
Haha's chase after gems)

2463
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:28,630
(He answered nonchalantly.)

2464
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:30,830
(Shaky eyes)

2465
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:33,000
- You...
- It's not the three empty heads.

2466
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,890
(2nd crisis: Jae Suk's
facial expression analysis)

2467
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:40,430
(He strongly denied it
and escaped the crisis.)

2468
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,930
- Yes!
- I saw his face.

2469
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:44,970
I don't think
I can eat for ten days.

2470
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:46,710
- You know what?
- I was so nervous.

2471
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:49,410
- I saw his face from the back.
- Okay.

2472
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:51,170
I saw Se Chan's expression again.

2473
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:53,050
I'm sorry, but I told you.

2474
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:54,620
- But the voting...
- Why did you not suspect him?

2475
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:56,250
- You should've said that.
- I said that about everyone.

2476
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,510
I said he was suspicious.

2477
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,760
They always say they knew it
after it was over.

2478
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:03,700
- He just...
- Look at him.

2479
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,520
This is what he does.

2480
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,700
- He suspects everyone.
- He does.

2481
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,890
- We didn't choose the spy.
- Who did?

2482
01:25:09,890 --> 01:25:12,390
- You distributed the gems, right?
- Yes.

2483
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:13,910
- How many did I get?
- The member...

2484
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:15,510
who got the fewest gems...

2485
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:16,730
- was the spy.
- Who gave gems to me?

2486
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:18,410
And Se Chan got nothing.

2487
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:19,800
No one? So...

2488
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,300
- No one?
- When Jong Kook asked,

2489
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,550
"Who did you give it to?"

2490
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:25,840
I was afraid everyone would be quiet
when he asked about me.

2491
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,790
I was terrified at the moment.

2492
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,620
You tell me. Why did you
give me three meals?

2493
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:31,660
- What?
- Three meals.

2494
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:32,980
To make them suspect you.

2495
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:34,920
Isn't that because you like me?

2496
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,890
- So the suspicion falls on you.
- She just likes it.

2497
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:38,630
She just likes
that he took care of her.

2498
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:40,420
- Gosh.
- That was perfect timing.

2499
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,260
- Jae Suk got ramyeon.
- The one with the fewest gems...

2500
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,370
- So he should make the top three.
- That's the mission.

2501
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:47,260
- You were number six.
- So...

2502
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:50,670
I will tell you the final ranking.

2503
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:52,910
- Number seven is Suk Jin.
- What?

2504
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:54,550
You have two gems.

2505
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,750
That's cute.

2506
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,010
- That doesn't matter.
- Number six is Jae Suk.

2507
01:25:58,010 --> 01:25:59,750
- You have four gems.
- Gosh.

2508
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,550
Number five is Haha.
You have six gems.

2509
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:04,680
Ji Hyo and So Min have...

2510
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,160
- seven gems each.
- Is Jong Kook number one?

2511
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,550
- Number two is Jong Kook.
- I'm second place?

2512
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:10,090
- You have eight gems. Number one...
- You have a lot.

2513
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:12,350
- How many do I have?
- is Se Chan with 16 gems.

2514
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:15,090
From 0 to 16 gems. That's amazing.

2515
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,200
So everyone except
Se Chan and Jong Kook...

2516
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,510
- will get the penalty.
- Yes!

2517
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:22,800
- Jong Kook! This is great.
- Great.

2518
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,040
This isn't so bad.

2519
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,580
- This is nice. Okay.
- Okay.

2520
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,800
- This isn't so bad.
- This is great.

2521
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,950
I'm so happy Jong Kook
didn't suspect me today.

2522
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:32,880
Here's today's penalty.

2523
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:34,810
You'll be locked up in your rooms...

2524
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:38,380
until you give the right answer
to the quizzes we give you.

2525
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,460
Can't we go home
before we get it right?

2526
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:41,830
That's just...

2527
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,000
I'd rather get slapped with water.

2528
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:45,460
- That would be better.
- I'm sorry,

2529
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:47,090
but let me go home before nine.

2530
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:49,200
- The penalty isn't so bad.
- I need to put my kids to sleep.

2531
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,800
This is too harsh for the members.

2532
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,170
You will need more questions.
What you have is not enough.

2533
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:56,910
Bye, Jong Kook. Bye, Haha.

2534
01:26:56,910 --> 01:26:58,840
I'll stay and hear
the first two questions.

2535
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,270
Hey, So Min.

2536
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:03,380
- So Min.
- My gosh.

2537
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:05,080
- Who is it?
- So Min.

2538
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,470
- Yes?
- Jae Suk.

2539
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:08,290
Please help us.

2540
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,090
Here's the question.

2541
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:11,260
Is that Se Chan?

2542
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:15,180
It is a request to not publish...

2543
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:16,680
information or news...

2544
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,630
until a certain period of time.

2545
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:22,300
- What is it called?
- What did you say?

2546
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:23,970
So Min, give your answer.

2547
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,200
- What? A halt?
- What?

2548
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,760
We have two members
who gave the correct answer.

2549
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:29,760
Yoo Jae Suk and Ji Suk Jin.
Come on out.

2550
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,970
(Jae Suk and Suk Jin
are the first ones to escape.)

2551
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:32,770
I'll give you the question.

2552
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:37,080
He's famous for his speech
that starts, "I have a dream."

2553
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:41,290
He won the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1964.

2554
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:42,720
Who is he?

2555
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:44,010
The answer is...

2556
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:45,790
(Martin Luther King)

2557
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:47,050
I don't know.

2558
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:48,180
(To So Min, "I have a dream" is
the lyrics of "Goose's Dream.")

2559
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,420
I have no idea.

2560
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,200
Haha can go home.

2561
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:55,520
What's the process where a plant
produces food with light?

2562
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,800
You should know this one.

2563
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,970
- This is the next question.
- The next one.

2564
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:01,010
I'll give you an easy question.

2565
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:02,540
This is an easy one.

2566
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:04,430
I'll give you another one.
This is easy.

2567
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:06,130
It lives in the sea.

2568
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:07,250
(It lives in the sea.)

2569
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:10,270
In an emergency, it ejects
black ink and runs away.

2570
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,640
It has eight legs. What is it?

2571
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:13,810
- Correct.
- Pass.

2572
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:15,510
- Pass.
- Let's go home.

2573
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:17,050
- Let's go home.
- Go home.

2574
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:20,120
(One rainy day in Seoul)

2575
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,630
(The members go out on the streets.)

2576
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,520
(Feeling all excited,)

2577
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,830
(they will wander
around the city all day.)

2578
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,890
(For this pleasant trip,)

2579
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:30,370
(there's one rule.)

2580
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:32,890
All right. Who should I ask?

2581
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,730
There's someone. Hang on.

2582
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:36,210
I'm too nervous to ask.

2583
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:38,670
(What's the most famous thing
on Mount Nam?)

2584
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:39,730
(The locks?)

2585
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,750
(The locks? Okay.)

2586
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:42,880
Hello.

2587

(What's the most famous thing
on Mount Nam?)

2588
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:45,470
(The locks.)

2589
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:46,980
(It's the locks again.)

2590
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:48,290
What's the most famous thing?

2591
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,290
(They keep asking,)

2592
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:51,720
(but the answer doesn't change.)

2593
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:53,760
- Please let me ask you a question.
- Excuse me.

2594
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,290
(What's the answer
that they want to hear...)

2595
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:57,920
