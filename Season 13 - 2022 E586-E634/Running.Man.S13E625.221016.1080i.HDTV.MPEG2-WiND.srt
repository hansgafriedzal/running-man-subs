1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,280
(The morning of the shooting)

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,130
It's raining a lot this year.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,890
(Unlike the weather forecast,
it's raining hard.)

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,320
We were going to shoot
today's episode outdoors,

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,060
- but it's raining hard.
- I know.

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,660
(So they are looking for an indoor
place where they can shoot.)

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,840
- Jong Kook's place...
- If it rains this much,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,410
- it won't be a problem.
- It's no problem.

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,020
(So they decided
to walk around in the rain.)

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,820
- When do we start?
- Do I look okay?

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,640
We don't have to...

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,390
wear a mask in the open air anymore.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,430
So some of our production crew...

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,890
often take off their masks
during the shoot.

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,500
It feels strange.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,220
They look like strangers.

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,240
I will need some time
to get used to this.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,100
For the past few years,

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,310
we only met wearing masks.

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,140
Now that I see their whole faces,

21
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,870
some seem a little unfamiliar.

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,310
We will get used to it over time.

23
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,010
(Laughing)

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,780
He seems to like it.

25
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,940
- Hello.
- Hello.

26
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,080
So Min, you are pretending
to be Generation MZ.

27
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,310
He will make fun of me today.

28
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,680
- Attention
- I'm not wearing a wig today.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,530
- You came early.
- Hello.

30
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,530
Of course, I did. So Min, gosh.

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,670
- Jae Suk, please.
- Gosh.

32
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,790
(He messes up her bang.)

33
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,230
- She just went to the hair salon.
- So Min...

34
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,430
I know how it feels.

35
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,610
I'll piss her off.

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,140
- So Min...
- I just got my hair done.

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,200
I'll make her really upset.

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,370
- Are they shooting the opening?
- My gosh.

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,010
- Hello.
- Hey, why are you...

40
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,510
Aren't you supposed
to shoot the opening together?

41
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,040
You're from FIFA.

42
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,650
FIFA?

43
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,950
- Pass.
- This is...

44
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,150
Pass!

45
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,720
- Are you a ball boy?
- You're wearing the same thing.

46
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,390
- You're from FIFA.
- Pass.

47
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,620
- Shoot.
- The World Cup...

48
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,590
- will begin soon.
- The World Cup is beginning soon.

49
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,180
- It's 10 p.m.
- Right.

50
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,290
(Korea!)

51
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,820
(Singing)

52
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,320
Korea!

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,930
- Hey, shut it.
- The Taegeuk warriors

54
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,060
- You're from FIFA.
- Hi, Ji Hyo.

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,500
- Hello.
- Your hair has grown a lot.

56
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,760
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

57
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,870
- Ji Hyo.
- Hello.

58
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,370
Jae Suk. That's a cool-looking hat
you have on.

59
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,110
- I do?
- Because it's raining.

60
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,450
By the way, why does your hair
look like a thatched house?

61
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,540
- Because of the rain.
- No.

62
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,570
This is what I intended.

63
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,810
- That's not it.
- A thatched house.

64
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,010
That's because she's trying
to let her hair grow longer.

65
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,550
So it looks awkward
before it gets long.

66
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,960
What about you?

67
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,310
- You just look awkward.
- What's with your hair?

68
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,620
- Hey.
- You look like a hobo.

69
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,780
- You're just...
- A hobo.

70
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,120
You're just a bum.

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,460
- Hey.
- You always look that way.

72
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,590
You're just a hobo.

73
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,690
(He sowed the wind
and reaped the whirlwind.)

74
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,190
"You're just a hobo."

75
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,130
- Hey.
- What's that?

76
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,840
Hi.

77
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,370
- Don't act like you're young.
- What are you doing?

78
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,500
- No one does that anymore.
- It's like this.

79
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,810
If Haha does this,
it means it's outdated.

80
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,310
- Haha, young people do this.
- Hello.

81
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,280
- This is what they do.
- What's that?

82
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,650
They do this.

83
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,370
- Hello.
- Hi, Haha.

84
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,910
- Hello, Suk Jin.
- Let's do this.

85
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,750
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

86
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,960
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,720
- Let's do "Yappi."
- What's "Yappi?"

88
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,830
It goes like this.

89
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,060
- Everyone.
- Everyone. One, two, three.

90
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,300
- Yappi.
- Yappi.

91
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,650
- What's that?
- What are they doing?

92
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,720
Kongsuni.

93
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
- What's that?
- Kongsuni.

94
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,770
- That's really old.
- What's that?

95
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,770
- It's so outdated.
- Kongsuni.

96
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,840
- What's that?
- Do you not know this?

97
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,190
- This is what they do now.
- I know.

98
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,970
- This is funny.
- Today,

99
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,210
we have the FIFA chairman here.

100
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,870
- Hello.
- Pass!

101
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,900
- The World Cup is coming.
- Pass!

102
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,840
It's November 24. Let's watch it.

103
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
Go, Korea!

104
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,020
(The chairman works hard.)

105
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,220
It's November 24.

106
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,090
What will you do?
Will you watch it together?

107
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,250
Is your house empty that day?

108
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,620
Suk Jin.

109
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,750
You can come over
to my place if you want.

110
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,830
- You just want to bet money.
- You said you'd bet money.

111
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,960
No.

112
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,560
- You said you'd bet money.
- Hey.

113
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,090
- The FIFA chairman can't do that.
- It's just 20 dollars.

114
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,400
- He's the FIFA chairman.
- We will bet only 20 dollars.

115
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,930
Suk Jin, you can't do that.

116
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,370
- Didn't your wife go to the States?
- What?

117
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,500
- Didn't she go?
- She didn't go.

118
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,740
- She didn't go to the States.
- She went to Jeju Island.

119
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,130
- Jeju Island.
- She went to Jeju Island.

120
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,100
- I knew you were in a good mood.
- Right.

121
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,900
- I look energetic, right?
- Yes.

122
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,180
Last night,

123
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,550
I drove her to the airport.

124
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,440
(He can't hold back his smile.)

125
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,220
So Min, did you enjoy
your trip to Singapore?

126
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,650
- It was really fun.
- I know.

127
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,060
Seon Myung told me.
You just drank all day.

128
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,060
She didn't do anything in Singapore.

129
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,650
- She only drank.
- She just drank all day.

130
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,650
- She didn't even eat crabs.
- I didn't drink a lot.

131
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,530
- Seon Yoong was...
- It's Seon Myung.

132
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,870
- Seon Myung.
- Seon Myung is a picky eater.

133
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,770
- You spent five days with her.
- You went on a trip with her.

134
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,470
- But you don't even know her name.
- Jae Suk.

135
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,000
You know what?

136
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,470
They caught me when I went
through immigration.

137
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,680
- Why?
- Because you don't speak English?

138
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,580
No. I was standing
at the immigration checkpoint.

139
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,970
And they told me to come.

140
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,240
Seon Myung already left,

141
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,540
but I was called
to the investigation room.

142
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,240
And they kept checking
my departure date.

143
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,910
- How long did you stay there?
- Five days.

144
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,260
- You should just say, "Five days."
- I did.

145
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,890
I don't think she didn't know that.

146
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,630
- Just say, "Five days."
- So I wondered...

147
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,190
why they cared so much
about my departure date.

148
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,650
- It turns out...
- Why?

149
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,630
You should write down your departure date
on the immigration form.

150
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,440
I was supposed to write
October 2, 2022.

151
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,400
- But I wrote October 2, 2202.
- My gosh.

152
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,840
Oh, dear.

153
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,730
So they probably thought
something was up with her.

154
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,670
You should've said this.
"I'm sorry."

155
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,580
- "I'm Empty Head."
- Empty.

156
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,910
They seemed very serious.
They kept asking when I'd leave.

157
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,450
"Are you sure you're
going back to Korea?"

158
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,650
They could've thought
it was just a mistake.

159
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,690
- Jae Suk, did you hear the rumor?
- What?

160
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,980
When Seon Myung and So Min...

161
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,460
- went to Singapore...
- Of course, I did.

162
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,190
- Did you hear they went clubbing?
- No.

163
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,850
- Did you go to a club?
- It's a secret.

164
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,590
- It's a secret.
- Did you go to a club?

165
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,630
- People would recognize you.
- Actually,

166
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,640
So Min said she'd bring
some outfits for that.

167
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,270
She brought a dress.

168
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,600
With the low-cut back.

169
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,940
Please.

170
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,080
- Don't do that.
- Then we should have...

171
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,080
So Min and Seon Myung dance
during the opening.

172
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,740
- Hey.
- As if they're in a club?

173
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,080
- The thing is...
- We see her dance all the time.

174
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,110
The thing is...

175
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,480
Actually, I was...

176
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,760
with Suk Jin
when So Min video-called him.

177
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,480
- Right.
- I was right next to him.

178
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,720
So Min was wearing a pretty bikini.

179
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,090
- Stop it!
- No!

180
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,990
- Enough! Stop talking!
- Stop it!

181
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,090
- Hey. Ahn Chang Ho is here.
- But Seon Myung was...

182
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,770
- Dosan Ahn Chang Ho is watching us.
- Her bikini was more revealing.

183
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,470
- Seon Myung...
- Stop talking about Singapore.

184
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,170
Seon Myung's bikini was all strings.

185
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,900
Stop it!

186
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,950
- I don't want to hear it.
- That's enough.

187
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,150
Seriously...

188
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,020
I'm sorry,
but I don't want to hear it.

189
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,950
We have to work together.

190
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,410
I don't need to know
too much about Seon Myung.

191
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,780
Stop talking about Singapore.

192
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,330
- I have one question for you.
- Okay.

193
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,130
What do you think is
the most famous thing in Seoul?

194
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,130
- Mount Nam.
- Seoul Tower and 63 Building.

195
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,400
- Mount Nam.
- Seoul Tower and 63 Building.

196
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,990
- Gangnam-daero.
- The 63 Building.

197
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,270
- The 63 Building.
- The 63 Building and Seoul Tower.

198
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,900
- Myeongdong. The Bank of Korea.
- The Han River.

199
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,940
Gangnam Station.

200
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,710
The skyscraper in Jamsil.

201
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,380
Famous restaurants in Hongdae.

202
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,800
- It's 401.
- He means 401.

203
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,240
If you pick only one,
I'll explain the rules.

204
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,740
Where should we go?

205
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,450
I don't want to go far.

206
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,890
Let's pick something close
from here.

207
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,280
- Let's do that.
- Jae Suk.

208
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,390
If we say, Mount Nam,
we'll go there.

209
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,760
A cruise boat.

210
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,220
- If we say, Mount Nam.
- A cruise boat on the Han River.

211
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,400
- Dosan Park.
- Seoul is famous...

212
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,790
- for the Han River.
- Right.

213
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,030
- Most people know the Han River.
- But...

214
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,830
The Han River is famous,

215
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,140
but the symbol
of Seoul is Mount Nam.

216
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,200
It's Mount Nam.

217
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,800
- That's the symbol of Seoul.
- The Seoul Tower on Mount Nam.

218
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,380
- Let's go to Mount Nam.
- The National Assembly Building.

219
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,970
- The National Assembly Building.
- Taekwon V.

220
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,170
What else, So Min?

221
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,780
The hair salon that did this to you?

222
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,450
It's a famous place, everyone.

223
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,020
The hair salon that made
your bangs look like this.

224
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,390
Let's go there.

225
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,840
- The symbol of Seoul.
- People would want to know.

226
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,150
The symbol of Seoul.

227
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,780
You should visit
the hair salon near Dosan Park.

228
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,530
Hairdresser Lee.

229
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,990
So...

230
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,200
We have Kang Chan Hee here.

231
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,130
Gang Gam Chan, tell us one thing.

232
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,640
Where do you think we should go
when you think of Seoul?

233
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,730
The Seoul Tower.

234
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,300
I think only people of our age
say that.

235
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,800
- Let's ask Generation MZ.
- It feels like...

236
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,100
We should ask young people.

237
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,710
Seoul is where
the 1988 Seoul Olympics took place.

238
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,280
- Jamsil! The hoop boy.
- And there's Hodori.

239
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,340
The 1988 Seoul Olympics.

240
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,240
- Hodori.
- Because...

241
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,840
we have to pick only one thing
that represents Seoul.

242
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,460
Hey, will you stop that?
It's out of date.

243
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,830
- Even I know that.
- Stop doing it.

244
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,850
I'll try this instead.

245
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,890
So are we going to Mount Nam?

246
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,260
One, two, three.

247
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,050
- Mount Nam.
- Mount Nam.

248
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,270
Han River.

249
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,360
All right. You think
the most famous thing in Seoul is...

250
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,490
- the Seoul Tower.
- Yes.

251
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,270
Before I tell you the secret,
I'll explain the rules of the race.

252
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,510
- Race?
- We are having a race today.

253
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,900
Today's race is called...

254
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,800
A Walk Around
the Famous Neighborhood.

255
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,970
That sounds nice.

256
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,080
If you try three different dishes...

257
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,170
before you take
20,000 steps collectively,

258
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
you will complete the mission...

259
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,580
and will be allowed
to go home right away.

260
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,340
(Try 3 different dishes before
taking 20,000 steps.)

261
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,480
If the number of steps
exceeds 20,000...

262
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
before you try
three different dishes,

263
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,590
you fail the mission,
and you all will get a penalty.

264
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,590
- We should try to walk less.
- How do we do that?

265
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,460
Are you going
to tell us what to eat?

266
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,770
You can eat any dishes you want.

267
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,990
Let's eat pork cutlet there.

268
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,230
Let's eat pork cutlet on Mount Nam.

269
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,540
We should go to Mount Nam
and eat pork cutlet.

270
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,440
(That's simple enough.)

271
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,130
However, before you eat,

272
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,580
you need to go to
a particular neighborhood...

273
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,600
and ask the people
to recommend a menu.

274
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,050
- That's what we did in Okinawa.
- Right.

275
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,680
It's something like that.

276
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,550
(It was the Okinawa Special
aired in April 2017.)

277
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,880
(She asks the driver
to recommend a menu.)

278
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,060
(In the mission
where they needed to hear "steak,")

279
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,260
(they heard something else...)

280
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,730
(and had to eat
the recommended dish.)

281
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,340
(And they ended up eating
noodles five times in a row.)

282
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,680
It's something like that.

283
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,050
- We only got to eat noodles.
- We only ate noodles back then.

284
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,840
This is the question you can ask.

285
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:31,110
"What's the most famous thing
in this neighborhood?"

286
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,980
- This is easy.
- They will say pork cutlet.

287
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,060
- Definitely.
- This is good.

288
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,990
- And udon.
- If we go to Sinsa-dong...

289
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,990
- Soy sauce marinated crab.
- That's right.

290
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,570
- We can go to Sindang-dong...
- Tteokbokki.

291
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,540
- Right. This is what we should do.
- Right.

292
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,040
If they recommend
a dish or a restaurant,

293
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,440
you can go
to the recommended place and eat.

294
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,000
But if they recommend
a famous place or attraction,

295
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,440
you need to go there
and take a photo.

296
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,080
Then you can ask another citizen
the same question.

297
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,270
I see. If things go wrong,
we'd walk more than 20,000 steps.

298
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,790
If you keep failing to find
someone who recommends food,

299
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,790
you can go to another neighborhood.

300
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,560
But you will have to
move on your own.

301
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,380
- On our own?
- You can either walk,

302
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,060
take a taxi,
or use public transportation.

303
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,300
We don't have a van?

304
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,890
If you get to eat,

305
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,170
we will take you
to your next destination in our van.

306
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,600
- Okay.
- Only when you succeed.

307
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,210
Earlier, you said
the most famous thing in Seoul...

308
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,100
- was Mount Nam.
- Right.

309
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,270
You will put on a pedometer now...

310
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,640
and move to Mount Nam
to start the race.

311
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,770
Should we go to Mount Nam?

312
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,590
Can we check our pedometers
during the race?

313
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,480
- You can check it anytime.
- Can we do that?

314
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,690
- Then we can control it.
- We can do that.

315
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,350
- Sure. It's no big deal.
- Put on the pedometer first.

316
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,690
- Okay.
- Pedometer.

317
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,800
- Are we going to the Seoul Tower?
- I wonder how Man Bok is doing.

318
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,330
The pork cutlet restaurant
is very far from it.

319
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,890
We should go to the entrance.

320
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,170
The pedometer is really big.

321
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,260
I think the count will go up easily.

322
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,810
(The pedometer is in a hip sack.)

323
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,630
This is the pedometer.

324
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,910
- When do we start?
- I think it's there.

325
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,450
- It has begun.
- Can I press it now?

326
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,970
- If I move...
- It's 30 already. I'll reset it.

327
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,680
It's 30 already. I'll reset it.

328
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,140
- Why?
- You can't do that.

329
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,050
- No, I should do this.
- Don't move.

330
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,590
- It should be less.
- Less than 20,000.

331
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,880
It shouldn't be high.

332
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,660
(Ji Hyo already got 85 steps.)

333
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,060
- It shouldn't be high.
- Mine says 66 already.

334
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,620
- It shouldn't go up.
- Mine is 12.

335
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,020
- It starts counting right now.
- It's 66 already.

336
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,970
You can take a taxi or public
transportation to Mount Nam.

337
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,840
- Please begin.
- Okay.

338
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,910
- Do you know how to get there?
- I do.

339
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,500
- We should take a bus first.
- Let's do that.

340
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,770
There's a bus-only lane.

341
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,910
I'll check the bus route.

342
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,450
There is a bus
that goes to Mount Nam.

343
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,500
- Shall we ride the cable car?
- That sounds nice.

344
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,140
The pork cutlet restaurant is
near the cable car station.

345
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,980
You're right. We walk less
if we ride the cable car.

346
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,920
We should walk like this.

347
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,560
- You don't have to do that.
- No, that's weird.

348
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,430
- What's weird?
- It's weird.

349
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,430
- You don't have to do that.
- Not now. When it's close.

350
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,200
- You don't have to try so hard.
- We can do this when it's close.

351
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,260
- You darn brat.
- Jae Suk.

352
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,230
We have to take
two buses to get there.

353
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,670
- Do we have to transfer?
- Yes.

354
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,670
- That sounds cumbersome.
- It takes an hour.

355
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,670
It's a 48-minute route.

356
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,730
- How about we take a taxi?
- Let's do that.

357
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,770
- Let's take a taxi.
- It takes an hour.

358
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,370
- Then let's split into two teams.
- Shall we do that?

359
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,100
- Then 2 teams of 3 and 4 members.
- Let's choose our teams randomly.

360
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,370
Then let's all choose
between a bus and a taxi.

361
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,090
- Which one do you want to take?
- I'll take a taxi.

362
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,090
Gosh, you.

363
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,480
- Let's choose what we want.
- No.

364
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,590
- Why? This is a democratic country.
- Point at the one to take a bus.

365
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,750
- Let's do that.
- Let's pick one person for now.

366
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,060
- One person to take a bus.
- Say, "You take a bus."

367
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,100
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

368
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,360
- You take a bus.
- You take a bus.

369
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,600
- No! I'm taking a taxi.
- You've been chosen.

370
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,860
Don't push me.
The number keeps going up.

371
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,970
- We should get there quickly.
- Yes.

372
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,310
- So let's all take a taxi.
- Okay.

373
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,680
It might take us too long
if we take a bus.

374
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,840
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

375
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,950
- I should go to the restroom first.
- Haha, no. Stop.

376
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,350
- I'll be right back.
- Hey, where are you going now?

377
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,400
- It's over there.
- You can't go right now.

378
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,950
- It's too far from here.
- Hey.

379
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,110
- Haha.
- Hey!

380
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,590
- Just pee here, you punk.
- Do you want me to pee in the bush?

381
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,590
- No, wait until we get there.
- Gosh.

382
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,590
- What if I need to go on our way?
- Hold it in for a little while.

383
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,060
- Wait until we get there.
- Just hold it in.

384
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,520
You should've gone to the restroom
before the shoot.

385
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,780
I did, but I have to go again.

386
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,100
- He must have prostate problems.
- I guess that's the case.

387
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,120
- Hurry up and come.
- Right.

388
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,970
Why would you assume
that I have prostate problems?

389
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:06,970
- Just hurry up and come.
- Come back already.

390
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,360
If you go there,
you'll add up to 300 steps.

391
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,940
- We're wasting our time.
- Let's get going already.

392
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,240
Would it be better if I peed myself?
Or...

393
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
- Go ahead and pee yourself.
- That'd be better?

394
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,630
- Of course.
- Okay. Fine.

395
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,080
- I'll actually pee myself.
- Yes.

396
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,210
- That'd be crazy.
- Let's get going now.

397
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,240
- We can go now.
- Can we start walking now?

398
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,740
- Let's go.
- We're all walking slowly.

399
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,370
- Let's go.
- We're all walking weirdly.

400
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,740
- Like this.
- We're walking awkwardly.

401
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,350
(Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Memorial Hall)

402
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,780
Gosh, it's pouring.

403
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,250
(It started raining more heavily
when they had to leave.)

404
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,330
It's a shame that it's pouring
when we have to move around outside.

405
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,430
You should have pork cutlet
when you go to Mount Nam.

406
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,490
Why does it have to rain? Gosh.

407
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,760
- You said it several times already.
- It's annoying. Just three times.

408
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,470
Do we have masks?

409
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,200
- You're right. We need masks.
- Yes.

410
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,470
- We should wear masks in a taxi.
- We need masks.

411
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,000
We're wasting so much time
trying to hail a taxi.

412
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,980
(On top of the rain, it's a holiday.
So it's hard to catch a taxi.)

413
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,980
What's going on?
Are we leaving now or what?

414
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,450
(Bored)

415
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,690
Today is a holiday, right?

416
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,610
(The staff members can't just wait
for them to leave either.)

417
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,620
It's hard to catch a taxi...

418
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,700
- because of the rain.
- Yes.

419
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,020
So we'll give you a ride
to Mount Nam.

420
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,120
- Got it.
- Okay.

421
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,620
- There aren't any taxis.
- You'll give us a ride?

422
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,790
And it's a holiday.

423
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,360
- Sounds great.
- Oh, today is a holiday.

424
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,610
- Let's go to Mount Nam.
- Sounds great.

425
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,610
- Then please drive us to Mount Nam.
- Okay.

426
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,480
- You can get in now.
- Let's hurry up and get in.

427
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,900
- We should hurry.
- Haha, we're leaving now.

428
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,710
- Right. Jae Suk, you should drive.
- I can drive.

429
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,870
Let's go.

430
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,540
(Driver Yoo will drive.)

431
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,040
- Because it's pouring right now.
- All encounters

432
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,090
- Okay.
- And farewells

433
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,220
We'll use this vehicle
just to get to Mount Nam.

434
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,490
- Yes.
- Got it.

435
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,830
- Okay.
- I wonder why. It's odd.

436
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,860
- What do you mean?
- What's odd?

437
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,360
On rainy days when our show airs,
we get higher ratings.

438
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,390
- That's right.
- True.

439
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,340
- But it rains when we shoot it.
- You're right.

440
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,130
- My point exactly.
- What weird timing.

441
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,760
And it's sunny when it airs.

442
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,470
- Right. It's always sunny.
- It drives us crazy.

443
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,110
- People go on an outing.
- They all go out.

444
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,400
- That's life.
- Lately...

445
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,350
Gosh.
I really want it to stop raining.

446
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,210
I guess it'll be sunny tomorrow
seeing that it's pouring.

447
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,450
It'll be a beautiful, sunny day.

448
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,580
I'll turn on my TV...

449
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,910
You see,
I like Western-style pork cutlets.

450
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,690
- The pork cutlet there is so tasty.
- It's delicious.

451
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,960
- With bread and soup.
- Or udon.

452
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,860
- I like to have it with soup.
- I like it so much.

453
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,200
- I go crazy.
- Right.

454
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,600
I really like it.

455
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,860
- Add some pepper to the soup.
- Jong Kook!

456
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,360
- I like it very much.
- I like it too, Jae Suk.

457
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,630
- I'll have it with the soup.
- I'll have the fish cutlet.

458
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,810
- When I first tried it,
- Me too.

459
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,970
I was surprised by the size.

460
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,680
I'm having the fish cutlet.

461
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,240
- No, don't eat the fish cutlet.
- Why?

462
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,710
- Let's order a combo platter.
- No. Just have regular pork cutlet.

463
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,310
- Let's share it.
- No. Order the regular pork cutlet.

464
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,610
- Why?
- I'll have the cheese pork cutlet.

465
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,040
- Let me eat what I want.
- No. Have the regular pork cutlet.

466
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,080
Should I?

467
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,610
- It's taking me to Seongsu Bridge.
- I'll have a combo platter.

468
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,250
- You should make a left turn.
- I should turn left.

469
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,110
I think someone entered
the wrong destination.

470
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,520
No. You can cross Seongsu Bridge
to get there.

471
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,730
I'll figure it out.

472
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,990
You can go toward Hyatt...

473
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,120
Come on, Suk Jin.
Let me figure it out.

474
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,330
- I'm giving you advice.
- Just stay quiet if you don't know.

475
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,990
- I went to a school in this area.
- Don't butt in if you don't know.

476
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,930
- I'm giving you advice.
- Just stay quiet if you don't know.

477
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,740
- I went to a school in this area.
- Don't butt in if you don't know.

478
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,200
I used to pass by the place
on my way to school every day.

479
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,940
I said not to butt in
if you didn't know anything.

480
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,810
- Observe only Jong Kook.
- I went to Mount Nam...

481
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,840
- He speaks only when Suk Jin does.
- so many times.

482
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,850
- Suk Jin.
- I can see it from my house.

483
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,000
- Suk Jin, don't butt in.
- I can see Mount Nam from my house.

484
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,850
- Just be quiet if you don't know.
- Right. Don't butt in.

485
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,720
- Why do you keep butting in?
- You can go straight.

486
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,820
- Jae Suk knows what he's doing.
- Exactly.

487
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,650
- Just worry about the World Cup.
- Right.

488
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,720
The GPS is telling you to go...

489
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,880
Assist him since you're sitting
in the front seat.

490
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,380
Gosh, seriously.

491
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,230
- Like an assistant. Assistant Ji.
- I can't believe you guys.

492
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,890
You're sitting in the front seat.

493
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,490
- Assist him as the MC's aide.
- Assist him?

494
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,260
- Not an assistant, but an aide.
- The MC's aide.

495
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,600
- We shouldn't go up there, right?
- Of course.

496
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,310
I just realized...

497
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,840
that you guys are sitting
in the back,

498
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,630
- and we're sitting here.
- The youngest members are here.

499
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,580
- We're young enough to do this.
- Right.

500
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,870
Hey, So Min is considered young
when she's with us,

501
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,870
- Exactly.
- but she is...

502
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,410
I realized
that you guys weren't so young.

503
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,540
- No. We're the youngest here.
- We're still young.

504
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,410
- We're in our late 30s.
- You guys are old.

505
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,220
- Hey, you guys are quite old.
- That's right.

506
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,460
Se Chan is treated like a teacher
on "Comedy Big League."

507
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,750
- Yes. He's like a school teacher.
- No. He...

508
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,990
- They'll turn 40 soon.
- That's right.

509
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,730
You're right. We'll turn 40 soon.

510
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,790
But we're the youngest here.

511
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,570
Yes, we are.
The youngest members are almost 40.

512
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,340
Jae Suk, I'm 42.

513
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,070
- I know that.
- Of course, we all know that.

514
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,570
Ji Hyo, you're the same age
as my wife Kyung Eun.

515
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,770
Yes, I am.

516
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,680
- Really?
- If you think about that... Yes.

517
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,710
(The youngest members are not
so young anymore.)

518
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,900
Suk Jin is... I mean...

519
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,220
- I attended a wedding recently.
- Yes.

520
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,450
I found out that Suk Jin was
older than Kim Kwang Kyu.

521
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,990
- You're lying. Really?
- Yes, it's true.

522
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,920
- He came on this show before.
- Right, he did.

523
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,220
- But I didn't know that.
- He came on the show.

524
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,850
I realized this once again that day.

525
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,890
Jae Suk and I have worked together
at so many weddings.

526
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,160
- At a lot of weddings.
- True.

527
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,290
- Do they have good chemistry?
- Jae Suk hosts, and he sings.

528
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,930
- Jong Kook and I...
- They come in a set.

529
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,130
- sang at and hosted...
- A lot of weddings.

530
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,830
the weddings
of many producers and writers.

531
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,970
And Suk Jin performed
his signature Oswa Dance...

532
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,240
- at all of those weddings.
- Yes, he did.

533
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,330
- His dance...
- Hey.

534
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,880
- Stop making me do that.
- He does that...

535
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,070
- all the time.
- It's included in the package...

536
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,240
for weddings
of the employees of SBS.

537
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,040
Oswa!

538
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,300
(This is the footage of him
performing the Oswa Dance.)

539
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,680
Oswa for love!

540
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,740
(The shamanic dance
to bring blessings)

541
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,150
Oswa for fertility!

542
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,650
They will have
as many children as they want...

543
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,460
- Yes. It's a tradition.
- I do the Oswa Dance...

544
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,120
at any SBS employee's wedding.

545
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,160
It's like touching the nose...

546
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,580
- of a stone statue on Jeju Island.
- Exactly.

547
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,230
- That's what it's like.
- Like a rocking stone.

548
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,900
Then when I get married,

549
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,090
I want Jae Suk...

550
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,990
- to officiate my wedding...
- If he's still healthy enough.

551
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,440
- Get married before he dies.
- You should hurry.

552
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,470
- You never know. Hurry up.
- "Grandpa."

553
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,770
- Hey, So Min.
- Yes?

554
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,600
Of course, we'd do it for you
when you get married.

555
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,340
I want him to officiate it
and you to host it.

556
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,980
- You want me to host your wedding?
- Yes, host my wedding.

557
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,220
Then can Haha and I be
your bridesmaids?

558
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,720
- Sorry?
- Is it called a floral kid?

559
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,580
- Yes. A flower child.
- A floral kid.

560
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,490
- Is it "flower child?"
- My gosh. What's "floral kid?"

561
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,280
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, right. It's "flower child."

562
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,510
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh. He said "floral kid."

563
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,350
- What was that?
- You know...

564
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,290
- When I said that, Ji Hyo said,
- You drive me crazy.

565
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,050
- "Right. A floral kid."
- A floral kid.

566
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,170
- Well, it doesn't matter...
- A flower child.

567
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,930
since we all understood.

568
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,670
- That day,
- My gosh.

569
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,760
- Haha's daughter impressed me.
- That's cute.

570
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,560
- I see.
- Song Yi. Didn't you see her?

571
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,880
- She looked gorgeous.
- I was busy hosting the wedding.

572
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,300
- She can make facial expressions...
- She's so cute.

573
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,950
that suit different types of music.

574
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,340
Each of the members had a photo
taken with Song Yi.

575
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,040
As she walked toward Suk Jin,
she said,

576
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,620
- "Grandpa."
- "Grandpa."

577
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,160
- "Grandpa is here."
- Hey, she didn't say that.

578
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,580
Why are you lying?

579
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,850
- She whispered.
- I kind of talked her into it,

580
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,490
- She did say that. "Grandpa."
- but she actually said it.

581
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,970
- You guys called me a grandpa.
- She called you that.

582
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,970
Come on.

583
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,090
And Suk Jin liked it
when she called him that.

584
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,060
- Before that...
- Song Yi likes elderly people.

585
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,300
Suk Jin, I think
you should let her call you that.

586
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,970
- She made me want a daughter.
- Right?

587
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,440
- Having a daughter is different.
- Right. That's true.

588
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,570
That thought crossed my mind.

589
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,600
It's like a comic book.

590
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,650
- So Min.
- Yes?

591
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,980
Your father came home early
to see you, right?

592
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,310
- She looked cute as a little girl.
- Of course, he did.

593
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,080
- Right?
- My dad adored me so much.

594
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,350
- Right? You did a cute act...
- So Min was so cute.

595
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,720
When did it become awkward
between you and your father?

596
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,780
I think it was
when I was in elementary school.

597
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,320
- When you were in sixth grade?
- Really? Darn it.

598
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,790
- That was so early.
- Didn't it happen too early?

599
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,460
My dad isn't the type...

600
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,060
that shows his affection often
as you guys do.

601
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,670
- Is he blunt?
- Yes, he's blunt.

602
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,830
I'm not the type
that shows his affection often,

603
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,830
- but I do it to my kids.
- You do that, right?

604
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,060
- I do it often.
- To your son too?

605
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,140
- I don't think he does.
- Ji Ho? I did when he was little.

606
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,500
- What about now?
- He's not a baby anymore.

607
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,210
- Now...
- If he's treated like a baby,

608
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,910
- he would get upset.
- He seems to nag you a lot.

609
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,070
- Right. He nags Jae Suk a lot.
- He wouldn't get upset, but...

610
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,040
Ji Ho seemed to be really something.

611
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,080
He's really something.

612
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,580
- Ji Ho...
- He can be a match for Jae Suk.

613
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,990
Ji Ho is famous for being polite
in our apartment complex.

614
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,580
- That's right.
- Oh, he's popular.

615
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,320
- Jae Suk, I heard...
- That's nice.

616
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,750
Ji Ho greeted your acquaintances
at the beauty parlor too.

617
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,760
- Yes, that's true.
- I've met him, Jae Suk.

618
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,260
He's very polite. That's right.

619
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,970
- Se Chan has seen him.
- Did you teach him to be polite?

620
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,240
Se Chan,
do you go to a beauty parlor?

621
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,800
- Come on, Haha. Of course, I do.
- Hold on.

622
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,030
- What?
- You go to a beauty parlor?

623
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,030
- Yes, I do, Jong Kook.
- Hey.

624
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,240
- Chae Young cuts your hair, right?
- I work with a hairstylist.

625
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,680
- It's Chae Young, right?
- Did she put a bowl over your head?

626
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,770
A bowl?

627
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,980
We're here.
Let's ride the cable car here.

628
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,390
- Okay. Then we'll stop here.
- Right. Keep going this way.

629
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,220
- Suk Jin, see? I took you all...
- Yes?

630
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,390
to the right place without a hitch.

631
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,690
I could find my way here easily too.

632
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,020
- It was so quick, Jae Suk.
- Here...

633
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,130
- I could...
- Right?

634
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,630
- It was smooth.
- I mean, I'm in the back.

635
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,760
Anyone would take the same route.
It's not just you.

636
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,170
No. You told him
to take a different route earlier.

637
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,760
- You could move backward.
- He reacted.

638
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,990
He never misses a thing
Suk Jin says.

639
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,170
- That's...
- He's like...

640
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,980
- true love.
- the best damage dealer.

641
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,680
(It must be love.)

642
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,570
- You're here for a shoot, right?
- Yes, we are.

643
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,710
He seems so surprised.

644
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,810
(What a surprise.)

645
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,070
He got so startled.

646
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,880
"My goodness. Yoo Jae Suk is here."

647
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,950
(My goodness. Yoo Jae Suk is here.)

648
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,510
He got startled so much.

649
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,420
- Indeed.
- He was shaking like this.

650
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,630
- He almost had a heart attack.
- He got startled so much.

651
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,130
We're here on Mount Nam!

652
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,990
I haven't come here
for almost ten years.

653
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,490
It's so crowded here
since today is a holiday.

654
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,490
This is nice. It's been a while.

655
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,740
- We've arrived at Mount Nam.
- Yes.

656
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,440
As you said Seoul Tower,
take a photo in front of it...

657
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
- before you begin.
- Right.

658
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,450
Then should we go up there
to take a photo?

659
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,150
- Can we take a photo here?
- But we can't see the building.

660
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,070
- Gosh. I can't see it from here.
- I want to ride a cable car.

661
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,540
We can take a photo here,
but it's not visible.

662
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,080
- It's totally invisible from here.
- I can't see it.

663
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,690
(Seoul Tower is not visible
from here anyway.)

664
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,960
- Then should we go up there?
- Of course, we should.

665
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,350
- Let's go.
- Who wants to ride a cable car?

666
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,460
Let's not waste our time.

667
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,020
- We can't walk there.
- Really?

668
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,730
- We can't walk...
- I have an idea.

669
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,790
- I think I can walk there.
- How about...

670
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,130
two of us go up there...

671
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,630
while the rest of us wait
at the pork cutlet place?

672
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:06,740
When I said I could walk up there,
Hyung In chuckled like this.

673
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,500
- She didn't like the idea.
- She didn't want that.

674
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,940
- Most producers would've said,
- Right.

675
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,000
- "Really? That'd be nice too."
- Right.

676
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,010
But Hyung In chuckled cheerlessly.

677
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,310
- She was afraid you might do it.
- She didn't think you'd do it.

678
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,510
- Let's get going.
- Let's go.

679
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,580
- We should buy tickets first.
- Suk Jin, buy tickets for us.

680
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,850
Okay. That's easy.

681
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,960
I'll buy the tickets.

682
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,130
They'll pay for the tickets.

683
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,690
For seven adults.

684
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,020
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

685
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,230
- Jae Suk.
- I'd like a cup of coffee.

686
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,820
Jae Suk,
can't we hang a padlock too?

687
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,290
- Oh, my.
- Let's just go.

688
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,470
- He's right. Let's go.
- A padlock?

689
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,970
- You can do it some other time.
- So Min.

690
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,800
- Come back with your boyfriend.
- Let's just go, okay?

691
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,240
- It's not necessary.
- He's right.

692
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
But still...
Just to commemorate this moment.

693
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,330
It says we should go
to the platform on the third floor.

694
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,300
- So Min, do it with your boyfriend.
- Shall we take the stairs?

695
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,410
- I want to save this memory. No?
- No.

696
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,620
Oh, the pedometer...
Guys, try to walk lightly.

697
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,150
Don't walk with loud, heavy steps.
Our steps are being counted.

698
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,150
(Suk Jin: 90 steps)

699
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,890
Maybe we should've taken
the elevator. Our steps will go up.

700
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,130
- Haha.
- Yes. I'm almost there.

701
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,130
(Haha: 175 steps)

702
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,630
Haha must have walked
a lot of steps.

703
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,020
- It's unbelievable.
- It's one floor above us.

704
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,320
It's a lot of steps. Is this okay?
We should've taken the elevator.

705
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,670
- Right, we should have.
- Oh, our steps are being counted.

706
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,940
We should've taken the elevator.

707
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,830
Suk Jin, I don't think
we'll take more than 20,000 steps.

708
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,500
- We won't, right?
- Because this is...

709
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,240
- It's been a long time.
- I've never ridden it in the rain.

710
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,770
I haven't ridden it
in the rain either.

711
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,840
I haven't ridden a cable car
in almost ten years.

712
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,920
When you get up there,
take a photo and ask,

713
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,990
- "What's most famous around here?"
- We can ask the question, right?

714
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,460
- We should say the exact words.
- Oh, I see.

715
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,020
But it's okay for us
to say something like this, right?

716
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,130
"We've arrived at Seoul Tower."

717
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,200
- Yes. That's good.
- What's wrong?

718
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,490
- It's time...
- Exactly.

719
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,820
- We can say that much, right?
- It's time...

720
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,140
- Are we allowed to say this?
- I mean, it's afternoon.

721
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,830
- "I'm hungry." Is that allowed?
- It doesn't matter because...

722
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,970
I'm sure we're allowed to say this.
"Oh, perfect timing."

723
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,680
- "It's almost noon..."
- "It's time for lunch."

724
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,180
- No, that's not allowed.
- Really?

725
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,680
- Why not?
- "It's time for lunch." No?

726
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,770
(All sorts of petty tricks are not
allowed.)

727
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,150
How about we ask the question...

728
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,280
to just one person over there
for practice?

729
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,850
- For practice?
- Good. Go ahead and try it.

730
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,460
- I'll give it a try.
- Okay. For practice.

731
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,250
- That will be helpful.
- Right, Ji Hyo.

732
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,520
- That's a great idea.
- You know the exact words, right?

733
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,290
- "What is most famous..."
- That's great. I like that.

734
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,430
"on Mount Nam?"

735
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,030
Excuse me. I'm asking you this
purely out of curiosity.

736
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,600
You can tell me
what pops into your head.

737
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,740
What is most famous on Mount Nam?

738
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,210
Well, pork cutlet is very famous.

739
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,840
(- What's most famous on Mount Nam?
- Well, pork cutlet is very famous.)

740
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,070
(She heard "pork cutlet"
at her first attempt.)

741
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,420
- Oh, yes.
- He must've said it.

742
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,950
She asked for a high five.

743
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,040
I think he gave her the answer
she wanted.

744
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

745
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,160
May I ask you a question?

746
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,630
What is most famous on Mount Nam?

747
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,350
- Pork cutlet.
- Giant pork cutlet.

748
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,230
Thank you.

749
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,130
(Her second attempt was
successful too.)

750
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,990
Thank you.

751
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,830
(Reporter Song Ji Hyo did
a great job.)

752
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,940
- That's impressive.
- She's as good a reporter.

753
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,240
She's good at interviewing people.

754
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,940
- She's good enough to be one.
- I'm impressed.

755
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,000
- I've never seen her like this.
- She has talent.

756
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,710
- Ji Hyo, what did they say?
- How did it go?

757
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,240
At least ten people said,
"pork cutlet."

758
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,510
- That's great.
- It's true.

759
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,040
- We'll pull it off.
- That's great.

760
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,310
Okay. Great job.

761
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,810
I'm sure
we'll get to have pork cutlet.

762
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,620
- I'm glad.
- But we always fail...

763
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,750
when the game begins.

764
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,320
You know I'm from the streets.
Don't worry.

765
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,820
- You're from the streets?
- I can tell.

766
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,050
- You just admitted it.
- Sorry?

767
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,430
- You admitted it.
- He's from the streets.

768
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,670
I'm from the streets.

769
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,930
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

770
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,530
What did you say?
How many people did you ask?

771
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,940
- Okay.
- I asked about ten people.

772
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,530
- Ten? They all chose pork cutlet?
- Here we go.

773
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,940
- Yes, they all did.
- That's awesome.

774
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,740
- And they did this.
- I see.

775
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,840
- I didn't realize that.
- Oh, my. It's moving.

776
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,240
- Here we go.
- It's moving. My gosh. I haven't...

777
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,840
(The unusual scenery on a rainy day
outside the window)

778
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,540
My gosh. How many years has it been
since I last rode a cable car?

779
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,280
You already said
it had been ten years.

780
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,160
- Did you hear that?
- Of course, I heard it.

781
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,280
Hey, they might edit that part out.

782
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,200
It's magnificent.

783
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,230
This reminds me
of a rainy autumn day...

784
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,400
This is nice.

785
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,090
when I was in school.

786
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,060
Did you go to a school in this area?

787
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,640
- I came here very often back then.
- I see.

788
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,030
I rode the cable car here
with three of my ex-boyfriends.

789
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
I think I rode it three times.

790
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
(She shares her old memories.)

791
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,710
- Did you lie you'd never come here?
- Of course.

792
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,540
There are three padlocks
that I hung here.

793
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,570
- You hung three padlocks?
- Yes, three.

794
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,890
- I hung just one.
- She hung three padlocks here.

795
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,150
She pretended it was
her first time here every time?

796
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,220
Can't you find them?

797
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,250
It's because you throw the key away
after hanging it.

798
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,460
- I see.
- Isn't that a scam?

799
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,520
- This is so nice.
- What did you say when you arrived?

800
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,630
- "Oh, my. What is this?"
- Sorry?

801
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,470
No. "Oh, my. I've never ridden this
before. It's so beautiful."

802
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,400
- You did that three times?
- Some of the guys...

803
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,330
probably tied the key with a string
before throwing the key...

804
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,500
- It's moving fast.
- so that they could get it back.

805
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,300
(The cable car in the rain starts
moving faster.)

806
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,600
- Gosh. Why is it moving so fast?
- I've never ridden it in the rain.

807
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,210
- It's beautiful.
- I'm anxious.

808
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,210
We're going right into the fog.

809
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,980
It feels like
we're in "Jurassic Park."

810
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,040
- Gosh.
- Come on.

811
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,890
- Look out the window. Look at that.
- My gosh.

812
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,510
("Jurassic Park"
in Yongsan-gu, Seoul)

813
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,990
- Look at the forest.
- "Jurassic Park," my foot.

814
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,350
- That's ridiculous.
- "Jurassic Park."

815
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,350
- We're on Mount Nam.
- I mean...

816
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,820
- Look at those autumn leaves.
- We're in Yongsan-gu.

817
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,280
- Finally.
- It's beautiful.

818
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,060
We'll be able to see the tower
when we get there, right?

819
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,970
- Yes, I'm sure of it.
- Maybe not the top of it.

820
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,060
- Anyway,
- Yes?

821
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,000
we have to take a photo
in front of the tower...

822
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,240
and ask the question.

823
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,740
- Here...
- How about a cup of coffee?

824
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,440
- Sounds great. I'll treat you all.
- Look at that.

825
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,500
And if you go up, there's a place
where the floor rotates.

826
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,800
- What place is that?
- The rotating restaurant.

827
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,240
- Yes, the rotating restaurant.
- But it's too expensive.

828
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,180
They copied the rotating lounge...

829
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,740
at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel
in Los Angeles.

830
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,780
- Come on, Jong Kook.
- That's not true.

831
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,720
How do you know
who came up with the idea first?

832
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
He talks about Los Angeles
all the time.

833
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,390
Why would you talk
about Los Angeles?

834
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,160
It suddenly crossed my mind.
That's all.

835
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,790
Jong Kook is so nice.
Since I complained, he said,

836
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,760
- Yes, of course.
- "It suddenly crossed my mind."

837
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
- You brat.
- I know.

838
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,200
- I must say, he's so gentle.
- Yes, I am.

839
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,900
I must listen to you.

840
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,240
- He's so gentle.
- I respect your opinion.

841
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,300
He couldn't be more gentle.

842
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,500
- Even a wild beast can be tamed.
- That's right.

843
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,410
- He's really meek.
- You're so adorable.

844
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,880
His attitude changed completely...

845
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,340
after you appeared in a video
on his YouTube channel.

846
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,980
He's so meek.

847
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,450
Right after your appearance
on his YouTube channel.

848
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,080
Whatever I say to Jong Kook,
he says yes.

849
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,780
- We're here.
- Let's go.

850
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,220
We're here.
I really love this place.

851
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,490
Hello.

852
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,390
- Hello.
- Hello.

853
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,850
- I wish you all happiness.
- Hello.

854
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,130
Why is he acting like that suddenly?

855
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,590
- Look at the fog.
- I see a lot of elderly people too.

856
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,530
The fog makes the scenery beautiful.

857
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,060
It's beautiful.

858
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,970
Let's breathe in some phytoncide.

859
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,800
- Right, phytoncide.
- Oh, my.

860
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,410
- It's beautiful.
- The trees in the fog...

861
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,030
- The fog looks magnificent.
- How beautiful.

862
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,240
- Look over there.
- It's so beautiful.

863
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,740
- There're a lot of stairs here.
- It's no joke.

864
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,040
- It's incredible.
- I love this scent.

865
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,420
- It's so nice.
- My lungs feel refreshed already.

866
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,990
Why didn't you guys come here often
to enjoy this scenery?

867
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,310
- You should come here more often.
- You said it'd been ten years.

868
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,730
- It looks beautiful in the rain.
- Exactly.

869
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,930
- I've never seen it like this.
- The rain creates a mystical vibe.

870
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,230
- So Min, isn't this your padlock?
- No.

871
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,820
- It says "So Min and Min Jun."
- No.

872
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,900
No?

873
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,290
Mine is up there.

874
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,790
I hope we can see the tower.

875
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,030
- You fail if you can't see it.
- We fail?

876
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,330
- Why? You didn't say that before.
- Hey, don't say such a thing.

877
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,680
- That's not fair.
- It'll be visible if we get closer.

878
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,070
- There's a photo spot here.
- Of course, it's visible.

879
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,210
- Hyung In.
- Yes?

880
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,710
Can we have a cup of coffee here?

881
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,740
- No.
- Don't be so strict.

882
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,540
- Why can't we? We'll pay for it.
- There's fish cake over there.

883
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,420
- Of course, we can't eat...
- Fish cake.

884
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,250
anything but the three dishes.

885
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,490
Hey, can you give me an umbrella?
Hold on.

886
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,750
(It starts raining heavily.)

887
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,430
Hey, can you... An umbrella...

888
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,240
He returned his umbrella
saying he wouldn't need it.

889
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,760
- An umbrella...
- Don't give him an umbrella.

890
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,830
- Jae Suk, we can eat here too.
- Come on.

891
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,970
- Sorry?
- They serve pork cutlet too.

892
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,500
- Really?
- Let's eat here.

893
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,600
- They have the owl pork cutlet too.
- It's closer to the tower.

894
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,600
- Like the place in Hongdae?
- Yes. It's written in there.

895
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,040
(They're fighting for an umbrella
in the rain.)

896
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,650
Hey, did you walk
all the way up here?

897
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,540
Yes. I mean, no. I rode a cable car.

898
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,920
I see.

899
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,080
- You got rained on, kid.
- You're soaking wet.

900
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,190
Really?

901
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,780
- Yes.
- Kids find it fun to get rained on.

902
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,400
Kids these days are so friendly
and good with words.

903
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,430
- Hello.
- Hi.

904
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

905
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,400
- I wish you happiness.
- Thank you.

906
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,490
- It's nice to see you.
- I'm a fan of yours.

907
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,530
She said hello to Jae Suk,
but Suk Jin said hello back to her.

908
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,060
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

909
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,140
- Hey.
- I have a lot of good memories.

910
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,340
- I can't see it.
- Haha, so do I.

911
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,070
- Me too.
- I see the pavilion.

912
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,650
- I can't see it.
- And Suk Jin...

913
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,680
- Can I say just one thing?
- What is it?

914
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,340
Please don't say hello
to people when they don't seem...

915
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,550
- excited to see you.
- And don't drop the honorifics...

916
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,720
when you say hello
to middle-aged ladies.

917
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,730
- He's right. That's rude.
- "Hey, hi."

918
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,280
- When did I say, "Hey, hi?"
- You said that.

919
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,700
You said that to a middle-aged lady.

920
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,590
(Hello.)

921
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,730
(Hi.)

922
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,590
(He did it for sure.)

923
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,330
(They managed to come up
after many twists and turns.)

924
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,640
- Guys, it's still invisible.
- I can't see it.

925
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,240
We'll be in trouble.

926
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,410
I can't see it at all.

927
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,500
I'm sure we can see it.

928
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,710
- Oh, I can see it, Suk Jin.
- I can see it too.

929
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,650
- I can see it.
- I can see it. It's over there.

930
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,770
Yes, I can see it.

931
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,840
- I can't see the top of it though.
- It's not visible.

932
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
- I'm worried.
- It's really tall. This is it.

933
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,350
- I can't see the top of it.
- I can't see the top of it.

934
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,490
Now, you can see it, right?

935
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,730
- Let's take a photo here.
- We can take it from a low angle.

936
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,780
Would it be visible?

937
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,320
It's slightly visible.

938
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,930
- Let's take a photo first.
- What's that?

939
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,430
- We should take it here.
- Right. It's visible from here.

940
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,520
It's slightly visible from here.

941
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,560
- Let's stand here.
- What's that? I mean...

942
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,670
- I think it's from a high angle.
- You can say it's visible.

943
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,760
Of course,
it should be considered visible.

944
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,670
To be honest, I don't see anything.

945
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,870
I don't.

946
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,680
- Just the tip of the feet...
- So Min.

947
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,800
- Can you not go off on your own?
- Exactly.

948
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,180
What's wrong with you?

949
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,810
- Let's take a photo.
- What does she even talk about?

950
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,570
Let's lower our umbrellas
for the shot.

951
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,740
- I can see it.
- Right.

952
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,450
- It's there.
- I see it. Hurry.

953
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,490
- Right.
- Who's going to take it?

954
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,720
I can see it.

955
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,780
- Really?
- You can see it.

956
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,250
- Hurry.
- Who's going to take it?

957
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,820
(The fog clears
and the tower is visible.)

958
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,400
- Hurry.
- Who's going to take it?

959
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,820
- Who'll take it?
- I can see it.

960
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,130
- The staff...
- You're blocking us.

961
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,260
- Over there.
- Who'll take it?

962
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,590
- I can see it.
- Who's going to take it?

963
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,140
(He suddenly acts weirdly.)

964
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,900
Who'll take it?
Shouldn't it be one of us?

965
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,560
- There.
- Hyung In's taking it.

966
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,740
- Will Hyung In take it?
- We should take a selfie.

967
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,240
- What will it be?
- Right?

968
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,500
- The MZ pose?
- Let me have it.

969
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,950
Suk Jin, you're the worst
at taking selfies.

970
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,880
- What's the matter with you?
- Seriously?

971
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,490
- To splash water.
- Stop joking around.

972
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,220
- You can see the tower.
- There it is.

973
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,350
- Get in the shot.
- Lower it.

974
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,580
- Lower it.
- Can you see it?

975
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,220
- Should I rotate it?
- No.

976
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,280
- Yes, like that.
- You can see it.

977
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,490
In 1, 2, 3.

978
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,730
- Nice.
- It's good.

979
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,960
- Okay.
- Let me see that.

980
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,260
Gosh, that was hard.

981
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,900
- It's good.
- Let me see that.

982
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,290
(They hand in the photo
of them at Seoul Tower.)

983
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,870
It's right there in the photo.

984
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,500
- We took the shot.
- That's a success.

985
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,210
All right. Who should we ask next?

986
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,800
I think I smell pork cutlet.

987
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,180
Who should ask the question?

988
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,410
(They must ask the question
to another citizen.)

989
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,540
Jae Suk, how about this?

990
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,040
Jae Suk.

991
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,010
Let's ask the question
at a pork cutlet restaurant.

992
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,120
Don't you think that's a dirty move?

993
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,190
Of course.

994
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,890
"What's most famous at Mount Nam?"

995
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,320
That's all we can ask.

996
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,390
- Right.
- I met a fan earlier.

997
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,790
Let's go with someone older.

998
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,850
- How about a family?
- A mother and daughter.

999
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,820
- Someone who's with family.
- A father and daughter.

1000
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,790
- I see a family ahead.
- A father and daughter.

1001
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,290
- Over there.
- Hold on.

1002
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,590
- Who?
- Are families better?

1003
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,560
- Have we made a choice?
- Yes, a family.

1004
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,210
They'll definitely
grab a bite to eat.

1005
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,680
- Over here.
- Goodness.

1006
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,710
- Hello.
- Hello.

1007
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,800
- Over here.
- We want to ask you a question.

1008
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,150
Can we ask you something?

1009
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,840
- Hi.
- The both of us?

1010
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,540
- Sure.
- You can answer us instead.

1011
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,420
Who's going to ask her?

1012
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,990
Jae Suk, go ahead.

1013
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,430
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1014
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,520
(What's most famous at Mount Nam?)

1015
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,290
(Jae Suk musters up the courage
and asks the question.)

1016
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,900
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1017
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,760
(Will they say "pork cutlet"
like the others did...)

1018
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,640
(during the practice round?)

1019
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,410
(Anxious)

1020
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,600
(What's most famous at Mount Nam?)

1021
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,760
What do you think?

1022
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,480
The padlocks.

1023
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,040
(What's most famous at Mount Nam?
The padlocks)

1024
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,340
So that's what we'll be doing.

1025
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,310
(They'll be securing padlocks
at Mount Nam.)

1026
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,720
The padlocks.

1027
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,120
(Jae Suk's first attempt
is a failure.)

1028
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,220
So that's what we'll be doing.

1029
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,990
- That padlocks.
- Let's hurry.

1030
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1031
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,460
- Bye.
- Take care.

1032
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,730
- Let's take a photo of it.
- Jae Suk, wait.

1033
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,760
You have to take photos
in front of the padlocks.

1034
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,170
We'll take a photo of those.

1035
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,940
There are a lot of them up there.

1036
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,990
- I'm glad they're close by.
- They're up there.

1037
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,370
- Let's not be serious about it.
- Exactly.

1038
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,980
- So...
- Keep it casual.

1039
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,940
Us being serious
is why they answered us seriously.

1040
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,680
- Right.
- We should keep it casual.

1041
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,480
"What's most famous at Mount Nam?"

1042
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,950
"Gosh, I'm hungry."

1043
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,650
- That's not allowed.
- No?

1044
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,540
Why isn't anything allowed?

1045
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,620
We can't even say we're walking.
Nothing's allowed.

1046
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,580
- Here are the padlocks.
- Let's take a photo.

1047
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,850
(They walk to the padlocks while
adding steps to the pedometer.)

1048
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,430
Still... Here they are.

1049
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,790
Let's take a photo.

1050
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,900
Gosh. Look at all of these.

1051
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,170
We have these many couples in Korea?

1052
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,400
- Se Chan.
- All these couples...

1053
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,970
(Walking around meaninglessly
adds steps to their pedometers.)

1054
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,500
So many couples loved
and fell out of love.

1055
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,770
Let's hurry and take a photo.

1056
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,600
We took one
during our second episode.

1057
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,930
- That's right.
- Really?

1058
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,540
- Did we?
- Get in the shot.

1059
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,700
Get in here.

1060
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,450
- The padlocks should show.
- Over here.

1061
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,620
Let them show.

1062
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,350
Why on earth are you doing that?

1063
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,250
(He's at it again.)

1064
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,580
Just take the photo, Jae Suk.

1065
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,660
I'm trying to splash Hyung In.

1066
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,890
- The padlocks.
- One...

1067
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,350
- I can see them now.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1068
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,720
In 2, 3.

1069
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,930
- Okay.
- Good.

1070
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,390
- Let's go.
- We did it.

1071
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,430
You succeeded in taking
the selfie with the padlocks.

1072
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,890
Please go ahead
and ask the question again.

1073
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,100
- Let's not be serious about it.
- We'll be nonchalant.

1074
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,810
- Why don't I ask?
- Sure thing.

1075
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:56,930
Hey!

1076
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,970
- Hi, kids.
- It's good to see you.

1077
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,600
(Haha moves swiftly
to nonchalantly drop the question.)

1078
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,970
It's nice to see you.

1079
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,620
- Do you know us?
- I do.

1080
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,950
We're from Running Man.

1081
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,990
Your favorite TV show.

1082
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,310
All right.

1083
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,390
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1084
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,430
(After breaking the ice,
he drops the official question.)

1085
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,720
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1086
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,520
(Will they hear
"pork cutlet" this time?)

1087
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,330
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1088
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:27,240
The padlocks at the Seoul Tower.

1089
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,560
- We already took photos of it.
- All right.

1090
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,600
The padlocks. That means you failed.

1091
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,910
The padlocks.

1092
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,450
The padlocks. That means you failed.

1093
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,770
Please take another photo.

1094
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,950
What's wrong with you?

1095
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,270
What's the matter with you?

1096
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,720
- What's your issue?
- What's the matter with you?

1097
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,120
You pressure the kid too much.

1098
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,290
Why...

1099
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,520
- You pressured the kid.
- Why burden the boy?

1100
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,750
- Haha.
- You did great.

1101
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,830
- Let me ask the question.
- We'll take another photo.

1102
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,890
- Let me ask the question.
- We'll take another photo.

1103
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,500
Kids their age don't know you.

1104
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,660
(Kids their age don't know you.)

1105
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,890
- Let's take a photo.
- But he's a celebrity of 30 years.

1106
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,870
- Take the photo.
- Over here, guys.

1107
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,370
- Over here.
- Two!

1108
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,640
- Three.
- One...

1109
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,430
In 1, 2, 3.

1110
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,310
(How many photos will they take
before this is over?)

1111
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,500
- Okay.
- Are we all in it?

1112
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,680
I'll ask this time around.

1113
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,100
You asked the last time,

1114
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,620
- so let me ask instead.
- Sure, go ahead.

1115
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,850
- Try someone young.
- How about that kid?

1116
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,720
- Yes, him.
- All right.

1117
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,220
He seems to be a fan.

1118
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,680
- He wants to talk to us.
- Would you like to talk with us?

1119
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,410
- Sorry?
- He's leaving.

1120
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,680
Would you like to...

1121
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,490
Would you like to talk to us?

1122
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,290
- Sorry?
- He's leaving.

1123
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,560
Would you like to...

1124
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,160
- He has his hand up.
- Over there.

1125
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,500
The kid has his hand up.

1126
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,330
- Yes, over there.
- That kid.

1127
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,390
- Suk Jin.
- Hold on.

1128
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,970
Would you like to...

1129
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,000
(He's the only one
who hasn't spotted the kid.)

1130
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,160
Excuse me.

1131
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,600
He has his hand up.

1132
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,100
The kid has his hand up.

1133
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,810
- Yes, over there.
- That kid.

1134
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,470
- Suk Jin.
- Could you join us?

1135
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,680
Sure thing.

1136
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,770
- He's the worst at interviews.
- He's so bad at this.

1137
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,810
I know from experience.
He's terrible at this.

1138
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,850
- Hello.
- Hello.

1139
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,580
- At Mount Nam...
- Yes?

1140
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,160
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1141
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,790
- At Mount Nam...
- Yes?

1142
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,160
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1143
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,250
(What's most famous at Mount Nam?)

1144
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,790
(What will be said by the man
Suk Jin invited over?)

1145
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,660
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1146
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,890
The Seoul Tower.

1147
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,000
- Gosh.
- I see. Thank you.

1148
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,970
Suk Jin, come on.

1149
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,680
(They got
the Seoul Tower this time.)

1150
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,250
I see. Thank you.

1151
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,580
You must head to the Seoul Tower.

1152
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,540
- Come on.
- The kid has his hand up.

1153
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,520
How many photos must we take?

1154
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,720
Take one.

1155
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,490
- We can take one right now.
- Just a second.

1156
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,560
Can you wait for us?

1157
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,290
We need to be inside the tower.

1158
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,220
- We have to get up there.
- The tower?

1159
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,790
Earlier, why...

1160
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,930
(Jae Suk heads forward
to purchase tickets.)

1161
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,600
Seven adults, please.

1162
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,000
- Seven?
- Yes.

1163
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,120
- Seven tickets?
- That's right.

1164
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,390
(He's trying to pay
for seven people.)

1165
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,810
That'll be 112 dollars.

1166
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,700
Did you say 112 dollars?

1167
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,270
Why did you ask that way?

1168
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,470
Can you pay it with your phone?

1169
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,040
- People won't say pork cutlet.
- Got it.

1170
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,870
(Jae Suk makes
the unexpected purchase.)

1171
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,540
- This...
- It's 112 dollars.

1172
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,080
- But that's cheating. What is it?
- It's 112 dollars.

1173
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,750
- I paid 112 dollars.
- What?

1174
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,890
It costs 112 dollars
for seven adults.

1175
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,160
- Is it that expensive?
- For seven adults.

1176
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,120
- We won't be able to see anything.
- We'll come right back down.

1177
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,600
- It's fine.
- Did you purchase the tickets?

1178
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,450
- Did you say 112 dollars?
- That's what it cost.

1179
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,470
For seven adults?

1180
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,200
Hurry, will you?

1181
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,330
We're walking way too much.

1182
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,200
- And I'm starving.
- What is my pedometer at?

1183
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,930
I'm at 900.

1184
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,700
Mine is already at 900.

1185
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,870
(Suk Jin past the 900 mark.)

1186
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,000
What was that?

1187
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,700
- My pedometer is already at 900.
- This is bad.

1188
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,750
Suk Jin, this is all on you.

1189
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,910
It'll be too foggy to see anything.

1190
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,680
We'll add a lot of steps
once we reach the observatory.

1191
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,450
Check out the Seoul Tower.

1192
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,720
(They enter the Seoul Tower.)

1193
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,910
Is there a restaurant here?

1194
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,990
No, just the observatory and a cafe.

1195
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,720
- I can't see a thing.
- You can't when it's foggy.

1196
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,290
What on earth is this?

1197
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,830
How can we take a photo here?

1198
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,370
I thought screens
had been pulled down.

1199
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,930
I can't see a thing.

1200
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,810
We're at Seoul Tower,
so take the photo.

1201
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,370
Hurry and take the photo.

1202
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,310
- We all need to be in it.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1203
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,500
(At an observatory with no view)

1204
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,580
- Okay.
- Let's ask the couple over there.

1205
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,540
- Okay.
- Let's ask the couple over there.

1206
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,850
No, slow down.

1207
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,450
- We need to take this seriously.
- Hey.

1208
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,080
- Gather around.
- Let's not...

1209
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,680
- pressure the people.
- Don't rush this.

1210
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,950
Jae Suk, let's keep it casual...

1211
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,850
and go to them at once.

1212
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,160
No, we'll stay here.

1213
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,100
- Right.
- Approach them by yourself.

1214
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,270
- But here...
- "What's most famous at Mount Nam?"

1215
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,830
I doubt we'll hear
what we want though.

1216
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,040
Are you okay with that couple?

1217
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,200
Go ahead. I have
a good feeling about this.

1218
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm sure they're going
to grab a bite to eat next.

1219
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,910
I'm sure they're going
to grab a bite to eat next.

1220
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,470
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1221
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,350
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1222
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,270
(He approaches them casually
not to intimidate them.)

1223
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,080
What's most famous at Mount Nam?

1224
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,350
- Pork cutlet.
- Okay!

1225
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,950
Okay!

1226
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,680
(Someone finally said pork cutlet.)

1227
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,790
Thank you.

1228
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,830
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1229
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,100
This is insane.

1230
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,660
Nice and casual.

1231
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,390
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1232
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,200
- You're our savior.
- The pork cutlet.

1233
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,830
Someone said pork cutlet,

1234
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,470
so you may go ahead and eat it.

1235
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,970
- Pork cutlet.
- Let's go.

1236
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,040
- My friend.
- Thank you!

1237
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,540
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1238
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,100
- Thank you.
- No way.

1239
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,450
Just casually
dropping the question...

1240
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,620
We got the answer
by keeping it casual.

1241
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,310
- That's how we got the answer.
- Se Chan.

1242
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,020
That was fast of you.

1243
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,890
Why don't we grab some coffee
while we wait?

1244
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,250
Hyung In, can we get some coffee?

1245
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,830
Sure thing. Go ahead.

1246
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,180
(They take a break
while waiting for their coffee.)

1247
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,220
Seven iced Americano, please.

1248
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,500
- Seven?
- Yes.

1249
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,290
What's this? Come over here.

1250
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,220
What is this?

1251
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,270
This must be new.

1252
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,740
- What is it?
- It must be new.

1253
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,970
- Time capsules.
- What is this?

1254
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,970
- Time capsules?
- They have time capsules now?

1255
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,680
- Does it last a year?
- This is nice.

1256
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,250
You probably get to open it
when you want to.

1257
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,310
(So Min's pedometer)

1258
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,520
Se Chan...

1259
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,620
Jong Kook, check that out.

1260
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,990
Today's mission isn't an easy one.

1261
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,890
Those over there are time capsules.

1262
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,950
Putting an engagement ring there
and proposing later on...

1263
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,850
- I'm intrigued.
- Imagine proposing to someone...

1264
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,160
two or three years later
after placing a ring in there.

1265
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,750
It would mean a lot.

1266
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,500
This is fascinating.

1267
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,100
What if I placed a gift
for my wife here?

1268
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
She'd love it.

1269
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
(So Min is a very curious child.)

1270
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,040
I want to sit next to you.

1271
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,330
(It already exceeded 1,800.)

1272
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,180
It's so hard to eat three meals.

1273
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,310
It's going to be hard
to eat three meals.

1274
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,580
- Let's have pork cutlet quickly.
- That's so pretty.

1275
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,640
Let's check the pedometer.

1276
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,520
It's 582 for me.

1277
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,620
(This is a normal range.)

1278
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,750
It's 582.

1279
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,720
Oh, no. I'm in trouble.

1280
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,330
Oh, no. It's 1,872.

1281
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,290
Why did you walk around so much?

1282
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,720
- Why is it so high?
- Look how much you got.

1283
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,500
It's delicious.
The coffee is good too.

1284
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,270
- The coffee is so good.
- The atmosphere is also good.

1285
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,520
It's raining harder.

1286
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,270
(They're going to a pork cutlet
restaurant in the pouring rain.)

1287
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,770
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

1288
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,910
During 13 years
of doing Running Man with you...

1289
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,910
Isn't it the first time
being this kind?

1290
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,910
What?

1291
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,910
Kindly sharing an umbrella
like this.

1292
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,080
Yes. I think it's the first time
to share an umbrella like this.

1293
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,850
It'll become sweet memories.

1294
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,970
I know.

1295
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,040
Come here, So Min.

1296
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,410
I don't mind getting rained on.
I'm wearing a raincoat.

1297
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,850
It's a sentimental day.

1298
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,890
(To you, I)

1299
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,060
(Like a sunset glow)

1300
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,160
- Become
- Become

1301
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,500
- Sing a random song about rain. Go.
- A beautiful memory

1302
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,410
(When it rains)

1303
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,700
(And the song plays)

1304
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,100
(They became sentimental
and excited in the pouring rain.)

1305
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,450
Hello.

1306
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,310
Hello.

1307
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,140
(They're soaked with the sudden rain,
but they're just excited.)

1308
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,390
It's raining heavily.

1309
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,180
This is serious.

1310
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,790
- You worked hard.
- Yes.

1311
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,990
(They're going to take a cable car
to go down and walk.)

1312
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,390
I'm completely soaked.

1313
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,160
Hear the sound.

1314
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,060
Pork cutlet would be so delicious.

1315
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,930
- In this chilly weather.
- Pork cutlet after this...

1316
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,060
would be crazy.

1317
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,040
Having soup after some noodles...

1318
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,640
- With black pepper.
- But...

1319
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,100
- I want to have soup.
- you can't eat too much.

1320
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,600
We should eat two meals in a row.

1321
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,040
- No. I'll eat a lot.
- Me too.

1322
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,680
Because I'm in a rush.
My stomach is...

1323
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,000
What did you write? "Running Man?"

1324
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,040
- Can you see it?
- Of course.

1325
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,220
Why would I not be able to see that?

1326
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,220
- I can see it well.
- You have bad eyesight.

1327
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,080
- My eyesight is better than yours.
- Suk Jin has great eyesight.

1328
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,660
You can just say yours is good.
Don't say it's better than hers.

1329
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,080
- These glasses don't have lenses.
- It would hurt her feelings.

1330
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,720
- You don't have to compare.
- Right.

1331
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,750
How is your eyesight?

1332
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,750
It's 1.2 and 0.9.

1333
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,390
He has to have good eyesight at least.
Everything else is bad.

1334
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,290
How do you know
everything else is bad?

1335
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,830
- I'm perfectly healthy.
- I can just tell.

1336
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,930
This is not a joke.

1337
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,540
- Why?
- You are always arguing.

1338
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,540
- I...
- You're always arguing...

1339
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,080
- with someone.
- How do you know?

1340
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
I'm going to make a content soon.

1341
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,370
"I'm Going To Beat Up
Kim Jong Kook." That's the title.

1342
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,370
"I'm Going To Beat Up
Kim Jong Kook."

1343
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,810
- When?
- I got a content material too then.

1344
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,220
"It Was Self-Defense."

1345
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,390
(Kim Jong Kook, Ji Suk Jin)

1346
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,410
That would be it.

1347
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,560
- Don't do that.
- Then I'll be a commentator.

1348
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,080
- A commentator.
- I'll be a commentator.

1349
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,060
- Is it okay to finish real quick?
- It's okay.

1350
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,750
I'll try to film enough content.

1351
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,830
All right.

1352
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,390
Grabbing and shaking.

1353
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,560
- Let's walk. The rain is not heavy.
- Pork cutlet.

1354
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,640
It won't take long.

1355
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,060
I often came here
when I was a student.

1356
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,270
- You must have memories.
- Hello.

1357
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,830
- You must have memories. Hello.
- So many memories.

1358
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,310
I don't get to walk that much
if it weren't for a shoot.

1359
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,310
You?

1360
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,640
- Isn't it the same for you?
- I walk a lot.

1361
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,220
Do you like walking?

1362
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,890
Yes. I won't have
many chances to exercise otherwise.

1363
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,310
- I should walk at least.
- Right.

1364
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,790
I walk a lot too.
I walk for four hours.

1365
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,930
You do? You just said
you don't get to walk that much.

1366
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,950
- I do on some days.
- Which one is true?

1367
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,000
What's your true side?

1368
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,850
- When I walk, I walk a lot.
- When will you show it to me?

1369
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,500
When will we get close?

1370
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,370
Suk Jin lies too often.

1371
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,930
What on earth is the truth?

1372
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,140
- What do you mean?
- Suk Jin...

1373
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,040
What he said today and what he'll
say tomorrow are different.

1374
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,140
He can't say something contradictory
to what he said five minutes ago.

1375
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,700
You should check the pedometer.

1376
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,310
- I'm in trouble.
- It's so...

1377
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:33,810
That's why they found a restaurant
that is far. It's the pedometer.

1378
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,810
Oh, no.

1379
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,120
- Why?
- It's 3,050.

1380
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,180
What?

1381
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,810
- It's 4,000?
- It's 3,050.

1382
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,950
Why is it so high?

1383
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,160
Were you shaking while walking?

1384
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,560
Why is it so high for me?

1385
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,350
- I've been here.
- Hello.

1386
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,870
Hello.

1387
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,620
- Udon.
- It's wet.

1388
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,240
- Let's share it.
- It's soup.

1389
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,540
(The soup will warm them up
after being soaked in the rain.)

1390
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,370
It's the soup
you were talking about.

1391
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,200
Right. This is the soup
I was talking about.

1392
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,240
Thank you for the food.

1393
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,100
(The appetizer soup at a casual
Western restaurant is great.)

1394
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,040
Thank you.

1395
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,970
This is it.

1396
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,580
Black pepper.
Did you order udon too?

1397
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,020
- Yes.
- It's so good.

1398
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,080
(They're having soup sprinkled
with pepper after a long time.)

1399
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,390
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

1400
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,850
This is it.

1401
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,250
- You should have bread rolls too.
- It's so good.

1402
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,750
- Should I remove this?
- I...

1403
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,890
So Min, you look so pretty.

1404
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,660
Soaked in the rain...

1405
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,830
You look so...

1406
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,770
- That's unusual for you to say it.
- Your bangs are wet and stuck.

1407
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:26,870
It's actually better...

1408
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
(Laughing)

1409
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,240
That's cute.

1410
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,700
So Min, you're the prettiest now.

1411
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,100
You look good.

1412
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,200
- You look good.
- It's the best.

1413
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,310
- You look good.
- We're amazing guys.

1414
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,870
You look good now.
Good for you, So Min.

1415
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,490
She's making it entertaining
with her hair.

1416
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,120
She's trying her best for the show.

1417
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,850
Gosh. I should cut my bangs again
if I want to make people laugh.

1418
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,290
- What?
- I should cut my bangs again...

1419
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,450
- when I want to make people laugh.
- No. It's perfect now.

1420
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,660
- You look the funniest now.
- I'm good.

1421
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,930
- You look the funniest now.
- "You look the funniest."

1422
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:52,600
Ji Hyo and you look almost
equally funny with your hair.

1423
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,720
It would be delicious.

1424
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,790
We're hungry for real.

1425
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,200
But we should have three meals.
Don't we have to restrain ourselves?

1426
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,810
- But...
- You can't do that.

1427
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,870
- We came to have nice food here.
- We should eat three meals though.

1428
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,240
- You punk.
- We should've shared.

1429
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,640
When did we ever plan
for our future?

1430
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,100
Or instead of something heavy,

1431
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,620
- should we have...
- Okay.

1432
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,080
- Like a dessert?
- Like a dessert.

1433
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,310
- That sounds good.
- Yes.

1434
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,520
If you go to Ikseon-dong,

1435
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,490
the cakes are amazing.

1436
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,020
- Ikseon-dong?
- At small bakeries and cafes.

1437
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,160
If you go there, it's usually...

1438
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,520
I think you should keep it down.

1439
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,850
Yes. Speak quietly.

1440
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,200
Keep it down.

1441
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,290
- They don't even care about us.
- Suk Jin, please.

1442
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,140
This is quiet.

1443
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,390
Yeppi.

1444
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,810
Yappi.

1445
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,410
- Kongsuni.
- Kongsuni.

1446
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,370
- Gosh, he's so...
- How about the corndog?

1447
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,430
This is the corndog.

1448
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,810
He's a trendy grandpa.

1449
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,600
I'm very trendy.

1450
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,870
- A trendy grandpa.
- Something like this.

1451
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,970
But in my opinion,

1452
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,520
it's so cool that Suk Jin
tries to keep up with the trend.

1453
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,990
- It's cool.
- And...

1454
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,520
that's how he's getting old
in a trendy way.

1455
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,520
It's so cool.

1456
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,060
My grandpa died like that too.

1457
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,160
What's wrong with that?

1458
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,950
- Right.
- As long as it makes him happy.

1459
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,060
It makes him happy.

1460
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,500
I'm confident that I'm
the trendiest guy in his 50s.

1461
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,270
- Right.
- I acknowledge that.

1462
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,040
I acknowledge that too.

1463
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,310
Here it comes.

1464
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,370
It's here.

1465
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:11,810
- It's the giant pork cutlet.
- Giant pork cutlet.

1466
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,410
- Giant pork cutlet.
- Giant pork cutlet.

1467
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,810
Look at the steam.

1468
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,000
It's so...

1469
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,970
I can already feel the crispiness.

1470
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,850
The cheese is insane.

1471
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,680
- Gosh.
- Pork cutlet.

1472
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:23,490
It's been a very long time.

1473
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,120
Look at the steam.

1474
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,160
For me, it's cheese.

1475
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,490
I can already feel the crispiness.

1476
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,520
She likes cheese.

1477
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,680
Yes.

1478
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,250
- Eat.
- My gosh.

1479
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,020
I'll eat after you guys
because I'm the youngest.

1480
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,100
It's more delicious
as we were desperate.

1481
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,470
It's not a joke. It's so good
as we were desperate for food.

1482
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,200
(They were desperate for Namsan
giant pork cutlet more than ever.)

1483
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,430
(They're gobbling their first meal
as they're relaxed now.)

1484
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:43,640
- Oh, my goodness.
- Gosh.

1485
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:45,430
It's so good.

1486
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,540
At what age will I stop liking
pork cutlet?

1487
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,970
I still like it so much.

1488
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,970
Old men usually
don't like cheesy pork cutlet.

1489
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,540
Right. I want to know. At what age
will I stop liking pork cutlet?

1490
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,910
But we're in trouble.
How can we have three meals?

1491
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,950
I had breakfast,
but this is still so good.

1492
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,450
We should have something delicious
that has a small portion next.

1493
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,350
Let's move to the next spot.

1494
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,200
- I enjoyed the food.
- Here we go again.

1495
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,500
Where are you going?

1496
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,930
I ate so much. I'm worried
about the next meal.

1497
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,200
We can't have food
for the next mission.

1498
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,160
Why is it yours so high though?

1499
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,240
- What do you mean?
- Walk slowly.

1500
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,740
It's not about walking slowly.

1501
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,740
- Hey.
- Are you taking small steps?

1502
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:19,740
No.

1503
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,970
- It's over 3,000.
- Why is it so high?

1504
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,680
Jong Kook. It's not
that I'm taking small steps.

1505
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,080
- Why is it so high?
- Seriously.

1506
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,020
It's because I like moving around.

1507
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,120
That's true.

1508
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,250
It's over 3,000 for So Min as well.

1509
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,580
- Jeon So Man.
- Why is it over 3,000 for me?

1510
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,330
- So Man.
- Why is it over 3,000 for you?

1511
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:35,850
I think my heart is beating fast.

1512
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,930
What does it have to do
with your heart rate?

1513
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:40,160
Everyone,
be careful with your steps.

1514
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,830
You be careful.

1515
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:43,700
Gosh.

1516
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,060
- It's 1,600 for me.
- I mean...

1517
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,500
It's different.
You're just unable to walk a lot.

1518
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,740
What are we going to eat now?
I can't eat. I'm full.

1519
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,240
The staff members picked one for us.

1520
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,910
- They picked the area.
- We didn't choose it.

1521
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,620
Yes. If we could choose, we could
have tteokbokki in Sindang-dong.

1522
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,180
It'd be nice
if it's a famous area for desserts.

1523
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,620
I don't want to go
to Sindang-dong now.

1524
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,720
- Tteokbokki?
- That is true.

1525
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,560
When I'm this full.

1526
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,120
I want to go to Busan.
The seed hotteok in Busan.

1527
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,180
It sounds great.

1528
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,560
- It sounds great.
- Hotteok sounds nice.

1529
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,930
- Right?
- Blueberry hotteok in front of SBS.

1530
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,220
That's nice.

1531
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,390
- That's in Tanhyeon.
- Tanhyeon.

1532
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,330
Going to a famous coffee street
and having coffee would be nice.

1533
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,560
- I want some cake.
- I want to have something sweet.

1534
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,000
I want some macarons.

1535
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,600
Thick macarons.

1536
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,470
Suk Jin really
keeps up with the trend.

1537
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:25,470
- He's like a younger generation.
- Why?

1538
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:27,770
People your age
don't talk about macarons.

1539
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,870
I like macarons.
I always liked something like that.

1540
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,910
- That's awesome.
- I think we're like that.

1541
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,080
- What? Because we don't drink.
- Because we don't drink,

1542
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,490
- That's why I like it.
- our taste stays the same.

1543
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:37,620
Yes. It's the same.

1544
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,120
- Like a child.
- I think that's part of the reason.

1545
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,520
Suk Jin looks younger
considering his age...

1546
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,700
- because he doesn't drink.
- Because I don't drink.

1547
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:44,720
Right.

1548
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,020
- It's definitely a reason.
- Yes. If he were a drinker...

1549
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,020
Jong Kook.

1550
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,520
- It's nicely said.
- It would be bad.

1551
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,970
- Okay. Listen up.
- Listen to him.

1552
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,560
- Listen what?
- Jae Suk is talking.

1553
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,870
- The grown-up is talking.
- Hey.

1554
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,500
- Jae Suk is talking.
- What's up with you two?

1555
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,600
- Jae Suk is...
- I'm talking right now.

1556
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,250
- You little punks.
- I mean...

1557
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,970
We didn't finish talking, old men.

1558
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,350
Those in the back row, be quiet.

1559
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,470
People around me...

1560
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,310
You have a loyal friend.

1561
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,390
Jong Kook is docile.

1562
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,830
Go ahead.

1563
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:15,390
- Go ahead.
- He's such a nice one.

1564
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,490
He settles everything.

1565
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:19,100
You're too nice...

1566
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,660
to survive in this harsh world.

1567
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,290
A person like me
is unexpectedly nice.

1568
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,290
(A kind of worry
they've never heard before)

1569
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,000
- Keep going.
- Yes.

1570
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,470
Let me tell you this.

1571
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,060
Those who drink a lot
look much older.

1572
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,370
- Right.
- Those who drink?

1573
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,410
- That's true.
- Yes.

1574
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,910
- Those who drink less...
- That's true.

1575
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,000
- That's really true.
- Their face...

1576
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,770
becomes droopy.

1577
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,080
- Because the skin gets dry.
- Yes.

1578
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,250
- And guys,
- Yes.

1579
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,580
- you should have a good sleep.
- He's talking, you punk!

1580
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,080
I'm talking.

1581
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:48,180
- Let us talk as well, misters.
- I'm talking.

1582
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:49,930
Does he get paid for this?

1583
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,720
- Do you receive a salary?
- He...

1584
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,830
- Jong Kook is a nice guy.
- Does he pay you?

1585
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:54,890
- He's docile.
- Why are you doing this?

1586
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:55,970
He's leading the talk.

1587
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,870
- He's saying something nice.
- Yes.

1588
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:00,370
- We need to talk about this.
- Yes, we must listen to him.

1589
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,200
Jong Kook is almost like
my guardian angel.

1590
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,200
You should listen to him
when he initiates his talk.

1591
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,540
He changed completely...

1592
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,310
right after you made an appearance
on his YouTube channel.

1593
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,870
- That's exactly when he changed.
- That's not true.

1594
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,270
I've always been this way.

1595
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,410
- We're here.
- We're here.

1596
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,580
Isn't this Namdaemun?

1597
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,580
What's famous here?

1598
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,890
What's in this area?

1599
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,350
Isn't this Myeongdong?

1600
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,390
It's the Sungnyemun Gate area
near Myeongdong.

1601
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,750
- It's Namdaemun.
- Oh, it's Namdaemun.

1602
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,830
Isn't this area famous
for braised hairtail?

1603
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:24,890
- I'm full though.
- I don't think...

1604
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,930
we can have another meal.

1605
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:29,290
We're headed toward
the Sungnyemun Gate area, right?

1606
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,660
What are we having near Namdaemun?

1607
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,060
I haven't seen Sungnyemun Gate
for a while.

1608
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,700
- I've never seen it up-close.
- Really?

1609
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:35,870
It's Namdaemun!

1610
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:38,910
You've completed
your first food mission.

1611
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,580
The second spot is Namdaemun.

1612
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,970
- It'll be hard.
- We're in trouble.

1613
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,470
- We won't be able to find anything.
- We won't find any food here.

1614
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,750
- What could we find here?
- We won't be able to find anything.

1615
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,290
I'll let you ask
"What's famous near Sungnyemun Gate?"

1616
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:51,910
When we ask that,
they'd say Sungnyemun Gate.

1617
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,850
Do we have to keep
taking photos here if we get that?

1618
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,250
- Oh, gosh.
- Gosh.

1619
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,560
And currently...

1620
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,600
Are you planning
not to send us home today?

1621
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,270
You've walked 12,000 steps so far.

1622
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,430
- We'll be done with it soon.
- You should walk less.

1623
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,640
- We need to ask the passersby.
- We could get it at once.

1624
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,660
Wouldn't it be better
to ask someone who works here?

1625
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,740
Who?

1626
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,410
The one standing behind us.

1627
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,270
Then they'd recommend
the Sungnyemun Gate right away.

1628
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,680
What do you think we should do,
Jong Kook?

1629
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,270
I think you should give it
a thought...

1630
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:18,580
and tell us what to do.

1631
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,850
- All right.
- They're having a blast together.

1632
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,910
- You're good with such decisions.
- He's...

1633
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,290
- He's really sharp.
- Right.

1634
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:26,390
You don't need to hear
many people's opinions.

1635
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,250
What's wrong with you two?

1636
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,660
- You should just decide.
- It's because...

1637
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,350
- he's gentle.
- Then just tell us what to do.

1638
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,830
- He's gentle.
- Of course.

1639
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,600
You might start living with him
if he appears on your channel again.

1640
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,270
- You might start dating him.
- He's...

1641
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,560
- He's so gentle.
- He's gentle?

1642
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,810
He's gentle?

1643
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,370
I don't know when Jong Kook
will start dating,

1644
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,870
but I can't let him
date just anybody.

1645
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,450
I'm serious.

1646
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:50,370
- I'll have to see them first.
- Of course.

1647
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,720
He can't just date anyone.

1648
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,990
- It's not allowed.
- That's right.

1649
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,750
- Let's start asking around.
- Let's do that.

1650
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,890
- As long as they mention food.
- Right.

1651
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,790
Excuse me.
May we ask you a question?

1652
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,950
- Are we starting right away?
- May we ask you a question?

1653
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,560
(He goes straight to the person
passing by them.)

1654
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,450
- Do you know...
- Wait.

1655
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,060
what's the most famous
near Namdaemun?

1656
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,210
Wait. He's holding
something delicious.

1657
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,250
(Wait. He's holding
something delicious.)

1658
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,820
- Do you know...
- Wait.

1659
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,420
(Glancing)

1660
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,150
(What's the most famous
near Namdaemun?)

1661
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,250
- Goodness!
- King-sized dumplings.

1662
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,460
King-sized dumplings?

1663
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,530
(King-sized dumplings?)

1664
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,920
King-sized dumplings!

1665
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,550
Really?

1666
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:33,420
- Haha asked if he was holding food.
- Come on.

1667
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,420
(The director)

1668
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,690
(It doesn't count
because they cheated.)

1669
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,340
- Come on.
- You can't say such things.

1670
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,840
- Why did you do that?
- Why did you?

1671
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,270
Why did he have to act up?

1672
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,130
- Where did you get it?
- Near Namdaemun.

1673
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,210
Over there?

1674
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,780
That's a bummer.

1675
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,440
- Hey.
- Just don't cheat.

1676
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,420
- Who said it? Was it you?
- Why did you have to add words?

1677
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,380
- Why did you ask that?
- Because it looked like food.

1678
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,840
I wasn't the one who asked.

1679
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,880
Why do you do that?

1680
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,340
I wasn't the one who asked.

1681
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,820
- You didn't have to add words.
- You did.

1682
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,860
No, I didn't. It was Jae Suk.

1683
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,590
You should abide by the rules.
Why did you have to run your mouth?

1684
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,690
- It was a rare chance.
- This is a variety show!

1685
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:05,820
I had to say something.

1686
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,320
We got the answer
that was hard to get.

1687
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,000
Since we're on a roll,
let's ask someone else right away.

1688
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,170
- Let's go.
- Guys.

1689
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,070
If we walk, the number of steps
will increase.

1690
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,110
- You're right.
- Let's walk a bit...

1691
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:16,130
toward Sungnyemun Gate.

1692
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:17,230
Let's go.

1693
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,440
Guys, let's target those
who are holding plastic bags.

1694
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,250
- That's right.
- The one who's holding food.

1695
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,840
- We can ask them a question.
- And we could...

1696
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,670
look at the bag
when we ask the question.

1697
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,940
- We'll look at the bag only.
- We should...

1698
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,980
look at the plastic bag.

1699
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,150
As we look at the bag,
we could go...

1700
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,050
Can you answer this question
as you walk by?

1701
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,960
What's the most famous
near Namdaemun?

1702
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,530
(Running away)

1703
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:36,650
They ran away.

1704
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,860
There's no one around here.

1705
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,590
Listen. If people walk by
with food in their hands,

1706
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,070
then you should go, "Goodness!"

1707
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,460
We can ask them a question.

1708
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,860
All right. The staff
would let that much slide.

1709
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,300
"Wait a minute. This is..."

1710
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,840
(However,)

1711
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,380
There's no one around here
to ask a question.

1712
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:58,440
There's no one on the streets.

1713
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,440
(the streets are empty
because it's a holiday and raining.)

1714
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,090
There's no one around.

1715
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:05,320
- But the thing is,
- Because of the rain.

1716
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,860
we must ask anyone who comes by
since it's Namdaemun.

1717
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,820
There are so little people
walking around in this area.

1718
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,900
I like dumplings, though.

1719
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,800
- I love dumplings.
- What's the most famous near here?

1720
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,860
It's been a while since we
came out like this...

1721
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,030
to shoot on the street.

1722
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,340
Shouldn't we ask the question now?

1723
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,670
- Should we cross?
- Let's ask the question...

1724
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:25,900
to the people who cross the street.

1725
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,800
- There are elders here.
- No.

1726
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,710
They're not holding any bags.
Jae Suk.

1727
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,820
(Right then...)

1728
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,520
(Here he is.
He's holding a plastic bag.)

1729
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,920
Here he is.
He's holding a plastic bag.

1730
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,550
Over there.

1731
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,090
- My gosh, hello.
- Hello.

1732
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:41,530
- Let us ask a question.
- May we ask a question?

1733
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,650
What's the most famous
in the Sungnyemun Gate area?

1734
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:48,670
(Their eyes are fixed on the bag.)

1735
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,590
(What's the most famous
in the Sungnyemun Gate area?)

1736
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,440
The Sungnyemun Gate area?
They sell hotteok over there.

1737
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,440
- Hotteok?
- Yes.

1738
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,840
- Where?
- Over there.

1739
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,230
- This is incredible!
- They sell hotteok over there.

1740
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,780
(Hotteok?)

1741
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,150
(It's Hotteok!)

1742
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,340
No way! I mentioned earlier
that I wanted to have hotteok.

1743
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,840
- Thank you so much!
- No way!

1744
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,050
No way!

1745
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:07,590
- Thank you.
- He said hotteok.

1746
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,940
We... Did you get their hotteok?

1747
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,150
No, this is a toast.

1748
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,780
- It's a toast?
- Hotteok!

1749
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,250
Hotteok!

1750
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,250
I mentioned hotteok on the way!

1751
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,820
- We mentioned hotteok earlier.
- You completed your mission.

1752
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,230
- Hotteok is allowed, right?
- You can go eat hotteok now.

1753
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:22,670
No way. We even mentioned hotteok
on the way.

1754
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,860
- This is perfect.
- I want to go to Busan right now.

1755
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,860
- I really mentioned seed hotteok.
- It's perfect.

1756
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,730
You said you wanted to have
seed hotteok in Busan.

1757
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,130
- That's right.
- This is great.

1758
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,380
Thank you!

1759
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:32,940
Stay happy!

1760
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,050
(Thank you.)

1761
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,610
- We're on a roll today.
- This is great.

1762
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,340
- It's amazing.
- Let's go.

1763
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,250
- Hyung In.
- How did you think of asking...

1764
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,520
at that timing?

1765
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,860
They're having a blast again.

1766
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,250
- You're incredible.
- Good!

1767
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,360
- Good!
- Good!

1768
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,780
I picked him.

1769
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,460
- I picked him.
- Well done.

1770
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,050
- Hey, the sound of music...
- Move away.

1771
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,420
I picked the guy, but Jong Kook
told Jae Suk good job...

1772
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,690
for picking him.

1773
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:55,960
Of course.

1774
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,070
What happened?

1775
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:58,960
- They're on the same side.
- He's so annoying.

1776
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,270
Jong Kook.

1777
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,030
It's not that.

1778
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,630
- He's just annoying.
- The thing is...

1779
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,030
He's so annoying.

1780
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,300
You should stay still today.

1781
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,840
How is he any gentle?

1782
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,420
- He's gentle.
- He's leaning on one leg.

1783
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,210
- He's gentle.
- What?

1784
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:13,340
How so?

1785
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,320
- Let's go!
- Let's cross first.

1786
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,820
- Us four should hang out.
- Yes. We should do that.

1787
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,960
I can't hang out with them.

1788
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,360
The young people
should stick with each other.

1789
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,650
- That's right.
- You can include me, right?

1790
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,420
They'll shoot another show.

1791
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,000
They'll shoot a show like
"Grandpas over Flowers."

1792
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,190
"Grandpas over Flowers."

1793
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,590
We haven't filmed the show on the
streets of Seoul for a long while.

1794
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,070
- I know.
- I know.

1795
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:35,530
It'd have been so nice
if it didn't rain.

1796
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:36,940
I love browsing stuff like them.

1797
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,130
It looks like fun. Look at that.

1798
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,520
(Singing)

1799
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,980
- What are you doing?
- Stop walking like that.

1800
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,320
(So Min, Jae Suk)

1801
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:52,210
Hey! You'll increase the count!

1802
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,150
Oh, right. It'll increase the count.

1803
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,820
You two have the highest count.

1804
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,860
- Right.
- But it's so exciting.

1805
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,860
Mine is half of yours.

1806
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,460
Look around, though.

1807
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,530
- They're all here to have hotteok.
- She's making hotteok.

1808
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:04,670
So this is where they sell hotteok.

1809
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,630
- It's Namdaemun hotteok.
- Here it is.

1810
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,000
It's hotteok.

1811
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,630
Goodness. It's Namdaemun hotteok.

1812
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,880
Gosh, this hotteok is perfect.

1813
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,440
Hotteok is famous here.

1814
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,780
It's filled with fillings.

1815
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,980
It looks so good.

1816
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,440
- Se Chan.
- This is the line for hotteok.

1817
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,020
Oh, this is the line?

1818
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,650
- Is this the line for hotteok?
- This is the line.

1819
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:23,750
We'll be here. Go and get it.

1820
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,460
- This is the line for hotteok.
- Is this it?

1821
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,650
- We can be standing here.
- This is the line.

1822
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:27,780
Let them go and get it.

1823
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,420
Their hotteok is popular.
It's a specialty.

1824
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,150
- We get to try Namdaemun's hotteok.
- It must be really famous.

1825
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,070
- I know.
- I didn't know...

1826
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:35,170
- hotteok was so famous here.
- Me neither.

1827
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,090
Wait. They have vegetable hotteok.
I'll have that.

1828
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,340
- I'll have honey hotteok.
- I want to have that too.

1829
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,840
- What would you have?
- I'll have half of each.

1830
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,840
Four honey hotteok...

1831
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,880
- and three vegetable hotteok?
- That's right.

1832
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,210
(Singing)

1833
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,980
Jae Suk, why did you have to
start singing this song?

1834
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,780
- Singing in the rain
- It keeps repeating in my head.

1835
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,150
(Jumping)

1836
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,420
Don't take small steps.

1837
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,050
- Stop taking small steps.
- Don't forget the pedometer.

1838
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:03,380
- When it rains...
- You're too excited.

1839
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:05,730
- Stop it.
- I like it when it rains.

1840
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:06,820
(The grasshopper
is super excited in the rain.)

1841
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:10,090
One, two. Left foot first.

1842
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,590
(They can't stay still
like dogs in the rain.)

1843
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:15,300
- They'll complain about our steps.
- Is that so?

1844
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,570
Stop moving.
Stop making small steps.

1845
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,210
Just stay still.
Why do you two keep moving?

1846
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,670
Our step pedometers
have the highest count...

1847
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:22,880
- I'm so excited.
- It can't go over 3,000.

1848
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,380
I'm just so excited. What do I do?

1849
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,610
- How many steps have you walked?
- Me?

1850
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,780
Mine is 2,017.

1851
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,650
Mine is 3,187.

1852
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,250
- Mine is 2,017.
- Why did you walk so much?

1853
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,460
What about you?

1854
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,800
- Mine is 1,215.
- You walked so little.

1855
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,420
You know how old men
walk in small steps, right?

1856
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,000
- You know how grandpas walk?
- Mine is 2,017.

1857
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,570
- Foreigners...
- It's not raining anymore.

1858
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:45,570
What?

1859
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,860
It's basically stopped raining.

1860
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,400
I think it'll start raining again.

1861
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,630
Then I can unfold it if it does.

1862
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,070
It'll be inconvenient.

1863
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:53,630
- It's not inconvenient at all.
- It's better to just hold it.

1864
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,610
- I think this is better.
- Not at all.

1865
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,340
If you lean it on your shoulder,
it's really convenient.

1866
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,650
- Is that so?
- I can't feel anything.

1867
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,420
I am going to go over there.

1868
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,690
(Haha feels uncomfortable.)

1869
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,690
- I am very comfortable.
- I am very comfortable too.

1870
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,190
No one is using an umbrella
except for you.

1871
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:06,750
You are holding it,
but I am resting it on my shoulder.

1872
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,230
- It's hanging from my finger.
- I mean...

1873
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,420
It's hanging from my finger.

1874
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,750
- I am comfortable.
- It's heavy that way.

1875
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,500
- No, it isn't
- It's hanging from your finger.

1876
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,030
- You shouldn't carry an umbrella...
- When I come back,

1877
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,270
- if you find it heavy.
- Suk Jin might be on the floor.

1878
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,230
You shouldn't carry an umbrella
if you find it heavy.

1879
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,460
- This is more natural.
- It isn't heavy at all.

1880
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,940
- He might be on the floor...
- It can hang from any finger.

59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,199
with flyers on his body.

1881
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,710
It can hang from my pinky finger.

1882
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,480
- No one is using an umbrella.
- Look. You can lower it like this.

1883
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,750
- It's uncomfortable.
- I can put it in my pocket.

1884
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,380
- It's hanging from your finger.
- Come on.

1885
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,020
- It's hanging from your finger.
- What? Suk Jin!

1886
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,150
What?

1887
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,570
(Unconscious)

1888
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,050
I bet it feels heavy
on your shoulder.

1889
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,380
I am carrying it comfortably.

1890
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,050
I didn't know
vegetable hotteok was so famous.

1891
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,280
I bet it tastes like dumplings.
Fried dumplings.

1892
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,860
- Since when was it famous?
- I think...

1893
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,270
- it has been famous for 20 years.
- Really?

1894
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,900
- Yes. It has been famous for years.
- Why didn't I know that?

1895
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:51,300
It has always been here.

1896
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,800
Where are you from?

1897
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,440
I am from Paju.

1898
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:56,500
Did you come all the way here
to eat this?

1899
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,130
- She is my daughter.
- You are here with your daughter.

1900
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,550
- You are nicely dressed.
- He is stylish.

1901
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:03,780
We are the same age.

1902
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,050
- Really?
- What?

1903
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,420
- He is the same age as Jae Suk.
- He is the same age as me.

1904
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,280
- He is the same age as Jae Suk.
- He has the same build too.

1905
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,590
He has the same build too.

1906
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:12,960
- He has a nice image.
- Really?

1907
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,420
- The two of you look alike.
- He resembles Jae Suk.

1908
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:18,230
I want to look under the mask.
He has similar eyes.

1909
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,320
- He is wearing earrings too.
- Don't act like you didn't hear it.

1910
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,460
- He hates that he resembles you.
- You acted like you didn't hear it.

1911
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,130
He tilted his head upon hearing it.

1912
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:25,530
That was funny.

1913
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,860
Please look over here.

1914
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,770
(Middle-aged women
are taking photos of So Min.)

1915
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,440
- Your expression is the same.
- It isn't easy.

1916
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,610
- Hurry up and look over here.
- One, two.

1917
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,440
Did you take a photo of my mouth?

1918
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,650
(Did you take a photo of my mouth?)

1919
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,070
- I...
- Se Chan...

1920
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,570
- What?
- She took a photo...

1921
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:42,610
of Se Chan's mouth with a flash.

1922
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,110
She took a photo of your mouth.

1923
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,780
- She took a photo like this.
- With a flash too.

1924
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,130
- One, two, three.
- I will delete it.

1925
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,500
Will you delete it?
There is no need. You can keep it.

1926
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,820
Since you used the flash,
his teeth shine, right?

1927
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,090
(His teeth became popular
among middle-aged women.)

1928
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,460
- Hotteok.
- Really?

1929
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,770
She took a photo like that.

1930
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,170
Why aren't you guys coming back?

1931
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:01,610
- We are in a line.
- It takes a long while.

1932
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,460
- Were you waiting all along?
- Did people line up to here?

1933
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,800
Where did you guys go?

1934
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,280
- Suk Jin almost got beaten up.
- Why?

1935
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:09,280
- He had a fight with Jong Kook.
- With whom?

1936
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,170
- Really?
- Yes.

1937
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,280
Did you have a fight?

1938
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,050
- It's our turn, right?
- Yes.

1939
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,690
- Four honey and four vegetable.
- Four honey and four vegetable.

1940
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:17,920
Four vegetable. Okay.

1941
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,960
- Four vegetable and four honey.
- Four honey.

1942
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,960
Four honey.

1943
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,500
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1944
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,800
- Did you pay?
- Isn't the bag for us?

1945
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:28,090
- How many do you want?
- Take care.

1946
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,420
Jae Suk, how many do you want?

1947
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,860
- Four honey and four vegetable.
- Please wait.

1948
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:32,900
- Okay.
- Okay.

1949
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:35,610
My goodness.

1950
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,900
The weather is cool now,

1951
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,000
- but work must be hard in summer.
- I nearly die.

1952
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:43,070
- It must be hard.
- But people go, "It's tasty."

1953
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,050
- It gives you strength.
- "Please work for many more years."

1954
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:47,020
- Those words give me strength.
- Of course.

1955
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,690
- We are the same.
- Right?

1956
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,150
- Yes. We are similar.
- I knew it.

1957
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,750
When people say
that they enjoy my show,

1958
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,320
- I gain energy.
- Of course.

1959
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,630
Of course.

1960
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:57,750
It contains apples.
You see them, right?

1961
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,050
- She brushes it on.
- It's a vegetable hotteok.

1962
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,050
- Okay.
- She brushes it on the hotteok.

1963
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,500
- Try it.
- Please put them in a bag.

1964
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,730
No. You should eat it now.
It tastes different that way.

1965
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,300
- It's like dumplings.
- Shall we carry one each?

1966
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,300
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's carry it.

1967
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,030
- That would be better.
- Eat it.

1968
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,400
- Should I eat it now?
- Yes. Try it.

1969
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,280
- It must be hot.
- You will burn your mouth.

1970
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:12,980
- Should I eat it now?
- Yes.

1971
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,300
It's hot, so take small bites.

1972
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,380
- What's this?
- Vegetable hotteok.

1973
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:18,420
(My goodness.)

1974
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:20,880
- Vegetable hotteok.
- Thank you.

1975
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,340
(They receive a hotteok in turns.)

1976
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,710
- Vegetable hotteok.
- Thank you.

1977
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:25,320
- One more vegetable, please.
- Okay.

1978
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,530
- I will come again.
- Thank you.

1979
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,550
- Thank you.
- There is a paper cup.

1980
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:29,820
Thank you. Take care.

1981
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,130
- Okay. Thank you.
- Come here.

1982
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,550
- Thank you.
- Take care.

1983
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:34,460
- Thank you.
- You need to give me two more.

1984
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:39,170
- I... Thank you. Enjoy it.
- Hold on.

1985
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,400
- Be careful.
- They suddenly left.

1986
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:42,710
I need one more.

1987
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,280
- You got overlooked.
- Yes.

1988
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,300
- I hadn't received any hotteoks,
- We need to wait for Se Chan.

1989
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,610
but you told me to go.

1990
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,150
- I almost left empty-handed.
- Thank you.

1991
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,880
Be happy and healthy. I am sorry.

1992
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,880
Hotteok suits a rainy day.

1993
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,150
- Hotteok.
- Hotteok.

1994
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,980
It's really tasty.
Vegetable hotteok.

1995
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:00,280
Gosh, this is...

1996
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,480
- A tasty hotteok like this...
- It's rare.

1997
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,360
It's no wonder this place is famous.

1998
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:11,170
- I thought...
- What?

1999
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:14,090
it would be dry since it's thick.
But it's very crispy.

2000
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:17,030
- It's exactly what I wanted.
- It's tasty.

2001
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,610
It's hot.

2002
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:23,170
- What's wrong?
- I burned myself too.

2003
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,750
- Oh, no.
- It's hot.

2004
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,150
- Drink water.
- It's scorching hot.

2005
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:28,340
- I almost died.
- Hurry up and drink water.

2006
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,690
- It's okay.
- Your lips will get burned.

2007
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,150
It touched my lips.

2008
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:33,210
- It's so hot.
- You will lose your teeth.

2009
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,360
It touched here. Haha, it's so hot.

2010
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,360
You need to be careful.

2011
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,150
The next one has to be a drink.

2012
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:41,530
- But things won't go as we want.
- Bingsu.

2013
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:42,960
- Bingsu.
- That's a good one.

2014
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,190
Bingsu would be nice, right?

2015
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,030
Let's talk
in front of a bingsu place.

2016
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:47,900
- Do you have an address?
- It's a good idea.

2017
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,860
Set the destination
to Myeongdong Cathedral.

2018
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,340
- I know the way.
- Okay.

2019
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,130
- Do you know how to get there?
- I will drive.

2020
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,340
Suk Jin,
I know all the places in Seoul.

2021
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,380
(Yoo Navigation System)

2022
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,150
There are one-way streets.
Will you be okay?

2023
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,380
- Jae Suk knows how to get there.
- I know how to get there.

2024
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,840
Why are you making a fuss
when he said so himself?

2025
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,690
- I know all the places in Seoul.
- That's right.

2026
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:08,190
He said so himself.
He knows all the places in Seoul.

2027
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,030
Does he have something on you?

2028
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:12,460
- No.
- Does he know something important?

2029
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:15,530
No. He said he knows it,
so we should believe him.

2030
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:17,730
Jong Kook is quite gentle.

2031
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,460
- I am full.
- Same here.

2032
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,570
I can't eat more.

2033
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:23,530
I want to be a woman like hotteok.

2034
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,400
Why? A hot woman?

2035
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,170
- Yes.
- Doesn't it sound strange?

2036
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:28,800
Doesn't "A woman like hotteok"
sound strange?

2037
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,900
I mean...

2038
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:30,920
Would you be happy...

2039
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,840
if your boyfriend says
you are like hotteok?

2040
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,750
Suk Jin, stop it already.

2041
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,840
Hey.

2042
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,980
What kind of a man says
his girlfriend is like hotteok?

2043
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,480
- Come on.
- How will she recover?

2044
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,550
So Min didn't say that.

2045
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:44,300
- So Min didn't say that.
- Her beliefs are weird.

2046
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,090
- Why do you disparage it?
- It isn't her belief.

2047
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:48,400
- Why do you disparage it?
- What did I disparage?

2048
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,360
- Why do you disparage hotteok?
- It's his specialty.

2049
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,300
Don't disparage hotteok.

2050
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,570
I didn't disparage it.

2051
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:55,800
- You always say I disparage things.
- I love hotteok.

2052
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,360
My dog's name is Hotteok.

2053
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,230
- Really?
- Is your dog's name Longtteok?

2054
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,110
- Really?
- Why is it Longtteok?

2055
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:02,840
- She said Hotteok.
- Hotteok.

2056
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,070
What's up with you?

2057
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:07,550
- So it's Hotteok, not Longtteok.
- This is a trip down memory lane.

2058
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:09,880
- Back in the day...
- You went to Myeongdong a lot.

2059
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,190
- I went to Myeongdong a lot.
- He went to university there.

2060
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:14,860
- I went to university there.
- I see.

2061
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:18,460
Back in the day, I felt intimidated
when I went to Apgujeong.

2062
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,420
- I still feel that way.
- So...

2063
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,400
So Min,
why would you feel intimidated?

2064
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,820
Apgujeong is too much.

2065
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,190
Why? There is
nothing wrong with you.

2066
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,460
It's too fancy.

2067
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,230
- It's stylish.
- Yes.

2068
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:30,610
You are like hotteok.

2069
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,110
- What?
- What are you saying?

2070
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,500
- Excuse me?
- His tone is sarcastic.

2071
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,210
- What was up with that tone?
- Be confident.

2072
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:37,650
You are a woman like hotteok.

2073
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:39,550
Why do you keep disparaging hotteok?

2074
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:40,940
- Your words are lousy.
- I didn't disparage it.

2075
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,840
- Your words are lousy.
- Hey.

2076
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:45,550
You said you want to be
a woman like hotteok.

2077
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:47,590
Why do you keep calling her
a woman like hotteok?

2078
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,880
She said she wants to be
a woman like hotteok.

2079
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,690
Why are your comments so lousy?

2080
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,150
Your words are perfect.

2081
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:54,530
That rhymes.

2082
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:56,190
Okay. Let's wrap it up.

2083
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:57,570
So Min is a woman like hotteok.

2084
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:59,130
Suk Jin is lousy.

2085
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:00,460
- And Jong Kook is perfect.
- Okay.

2086
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,070
- Jong Kook is perfect.
- Perfect.

2087
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:03,400
- Okay.
- That was nice.

2088
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:04,840
It's like a song title.

2089
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:07,210
- Hotteok-like, lousy, and perfect.
- Perfect.

2090
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:08,710
Things were better
before he said that.

2091
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:10,550
- I agree. It wasn't that great.
- I know.

2092
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:12,440
(Suk Jin teaches them
that less is more.)

2093
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,920
I came here
during the Christmas season.

2094
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:16,150
- It's nice then, right?
- It's so pretty.

2095
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,210
- Back in the day,
- Wasn't it here?

2096
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,980
- they used to play carols.
- It wasn't here.

2097
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,280
(Jae Suk becomes quiet
as they near Myeongdong.)

2098
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:24,730
I know the way.

2099
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:27,250
(He didn't even search the way
on the navigation system.)

2100
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,300
That's the Myeongdong Cathedral.

2101
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:31,440
It's a one-way street.

2102
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,730
Shall we walk from here?

2103
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:34,070
- Myeongdong Cathedral.
- Myeongdong Cathedral.

2104
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:35,860
Hey, you should have used
the navigation system.

2105
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,940
It's a one-way street.

2106
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,610
- We can go around.
- I am sure we can do that.

2107
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:40,780
- For goodness' sake.
- Wait.

2108
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:41,940
Hyo Im is calling.

2109
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,150
- Hold on. Hyo Im is calling.
- I know this area really well.

2110
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:45,570
- Hyo Im is calling.
- Hyo Im.

2111
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:46,940
She called
because we passed the destination.

2112
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:49,380
We are going
to the Myeongdong Cathedral.

2113
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,280
- This way, we can enjoy the view.
- Hyung In.

2114
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,480
Okay.

2115
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,190
- It's Hyung In.
- This way, we can enjoy the view.

2116
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,230
- Hyung In.
- We can walk there.

2117
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,190
We can park the car here and walk.

2118
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:03,690
Jae Suk was adamant about
not using the navigation system,

2119
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,770
- so we got lost.
- Come on.

2120
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:07,960
- It's all because of Jae Suk.
- We are nearly there.

2121
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,130
Play "Myeongdong Calling."

2122
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:12,900
- Myeongdong Cathedral, right?
- I haven't been here in a while.

2123
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,980
- Play "Myeongdong Calling."
- Okay.

2124
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,170
It's nice.

2125
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:17,150
Are you leaving?

2126
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:18,480
- Seriously.
- Hey.

2127
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:21,020
Please play "Myeongdong Calling."
I will play it.

2128
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:23,090
- "Myeongdong Calling."
- I am sorry,

2129
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,980
but I want to listen to it
before I get out of the vehicle.

2130
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:25,980
(Driver Yoo suddenly stops driving.)

2131
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,980
This won't do.

2132
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:31,420
- His voice is insane.
- It's so nice.

2133
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:34,920
- Car the garden.
- It's so nice. Unbelievable.

2134
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,070
(These strange passengers
enjoy the song.)

2135
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:38,570
Let's turn off the light.
It doesn't suit the atmosphere.

2136
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:40,490
What was the singer called?

2137
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,610
It's nice.

2138
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:43,800
I like Seogyo Garden.

2139
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:46,300
We will... Oh, it's you.

2140
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,800
We will lead the way.

2141
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,110
Okay.

2142
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:53,040
(They just need to follow
the staff's vehicle.)

2143
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,880
The streets of Myeongdong

2144
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,240
This song brings back memories...

2145
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,860
- even though it isn't an old song.
- Myeongdong.

2146
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,450
I made many memories at Myeongdong.

2147
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,660
You suddenly started.

2148
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:03,990
I made many memories.

2149
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:05,330
(The production crew
is unaware of the situation.)

2150
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,230
(These middle-aged men are absorbed
in the autumn rain and music.)

2151
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:10,460
It's a bit like that in autumn.

2152
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,200
(These middle-aged men are absorbed
in the autumn rain and music.)

2153
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,490
Is it better?

2154
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,570
- We are sentimental today.
- Yes.

2155
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:17,610
- I feel lonely.
- I love the atmosphere.

2156
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,480
Music sets the mood.

2157
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:23,040
If we were going on a trip...

2158
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,300
It would have been really nice.

2159
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,650
- It would have been fun, right?
- It would have been really nice.

2160
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:28,520
(It's a 5-minute trip,
but they are taking 20 minutes.)

2161
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,950
When I think about it

2162
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:32,290
It was like a movie

2163
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,520
(Producer Hyung In calls again.)

2164
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,790
Hyung In.

2165
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:37,620
We are following
the staff's vehicle.

2166
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:38,990
We are following
the camera crew's vehicle.

2167
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:40,400
I think Jae Suk got lost again.

2168
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,530
No, we are here.

2169
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:43,200
- My goodness.
- He is childish.

2170
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,420
- He is sucking up to Hyung In.
- He is childish.

2171
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,400
- He is sucking up to Hyung In.
- Seriously.

2172
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,440
I told him to turn on
the navigation system,

2173
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,910
but he didn't listen.

2174
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,980
(He is telling the producer
that he isn't the one at fault.)

2175
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,780
- Okay.
- Okay.

2176
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:55,670
I knew it.

2177
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:58,870
(They hum as they enjoy
the romance of the autumn rain.)

2178
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:01,290
(They finally arrive
at the Myeongdong Cathedral.)

2179
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:03,950
It takes five minutes
to reach here from Namdaemun.

2180
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:07,320
- Jae Suk didn't...
- We got absorbed in a conversation.

2181
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,660
He didn't use the navigation system.
He said he knew the way.

2182
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,920
I got to look around the place
thanks to you.

2183
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,730
- Yes. It was romantic.
- What's up with you?

2184
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:16,490
- He is gentle.
- For goodness' sake.

2185
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:18,570
- He is gentle.
- I didn't know the place very well.

2186
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:20,160
- I think Jae Suk pays him.
- Thanks to the detour,

2187
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,200
- He is gentle.
- I learned a lot about Myeongdong.

2188
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,200
It was very nice.

2189
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,080
- I think Jae Suk pays him.
- I wanted to say that.

2190
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,740
- During the ride,
- I think...

2191
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,800
- So Min got a new nickname.
- he pays about 12,000 dollars.

2192
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,610
- Hotteok-like Woman.
- Hotteok-like Woman.

2193
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:32,870
We are now in Myeongdong.

2194
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:35,080
Let's check the pedometers first.

2195
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,490
- You took 17,004 steps.
- They were filming.

2196
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:42,120
So 3,000 steps remain.
You can ask the question now.

2197
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,830
Who hasn't gone yet? So Min, right?

2198
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:46,030
So Min should ask.

2199
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:48,230
- Go.
- No. She is a hotteok-like woman.

2200
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:49,700
Hotteok, go.

2201
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:50,700
(Hotteok-like Woman
will ask the question.)

2202
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,770
What's famous in Myeongdong?

2203
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,490
- "Most famous."
- What's most famous in Myeongdong?

2204
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:55,570
"Most famous."

2205
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,870
(She approaches a citizen nearby.)

2206
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

2207
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,280
May I ask you a question?

2208
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,450
What's most famous in Myeongdong?

2209
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:07,040
The next one has to be a drink.

2210
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,380
(The members are full,
so they want a refreshing drink.)

2211
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:10,580
Or Bingsu.

2212
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:14,660
(What will be the answer?)

2213
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:16,860
Myeongdong Cathedral.

2214
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,790
(They got Myeongdong Cathedral.)

2215
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:21,370
She said Myeongdong Cathedral.

2216
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,570
Myeongdong Cathedral?

2217
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,130
Thank you.

2218
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:27,630
- It's very beautiful.
- Yes.

2219
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,630
Jae Suk.

2220
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,870
- Jae Suk.
- About the things

2221
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:32,910
- What?
- I lost

2222
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,580
She said Myeongdong Cathedral.

2223
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:36,700
- That's good.
- Really?

2224
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,450
I have always wanted to visit
Myeongdong Cathedral.

2225
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:40,370
- She said Myeongdong Cathedral.
- Let's go there.

2226
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:41,490
We need to take a photo.

2227
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:45,620
My heart becomes calm when I think
of Myeongdong Cathedral.

2228
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,490
- It's beautiful.
- I have never visited it.

2229
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:49,250
- Now...
- I am sorry, but are you Catholic?

2230
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,330
No.

2231
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:53,450
Her first love became a nun
after he broke up with her.

2232
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:54,590
- Really?
- Yes.

2233
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:57,290
She thought,
"I would rather become a nun."

2234
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:59,490
"I can't believe
an ugly man dumped me."

2235
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,990
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2236
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:02,330
Let's go.

2237
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:04,670
Since we came this far,
we should check out the cathedral.

2238
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:05,700
That's right.

2239
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:06,700
Get your microphone.

2240
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,040
(Myeongdong Cathedral
is more beautiful in the rain.)

2241
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,080
- I got it.
- It's cool, right?

2242
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,040
- Myeongdong Cathedral is nice.
- My goodness.

2243
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,380
- It's pretty.
- My heart...

2244
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,840
- Emotions fill my heart.
- Emotions fill my heart.

2245
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:19,020
Seriously.

2246
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,860
- It's my first time here.
- It's prettier inside.

2247
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:23,250
- It's so cool.
- I only passed by the cathedral.

2248
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,090
It's really old.

2249
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,230
- It's cool.
- It's cool.

2250
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,070
People kiss here at 12 p.m.

2251
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,090
Why?

2252
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:35,160
It was trendy to kiss
in front of the cathedral.

2253
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,200
Was it a signature move?

2254
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,240
- Really?
- You can kiss at 12 p.m.

2255
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,630
The two of you can kiss.

2256
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,410
That's a signature move.

2257
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:45,240
Regardless of the shoot,
we should take a photo here.

2258
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:48,840
- Can't I call you guys "Sisters?"
- No.

2259
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,790
- Myeongdong Cathedral.
- Okay.

2260
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,320
(They finish taking a photo.)

2261
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:55,580
You know, this place...

2262
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,790
When I build a house later,
I should use this color scheme.

2263
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,400
- What?
- It's atmospheric.

2264
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,900
Will you build a house
in the Gothic style?

2265
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,490
- A brick house.
- That's the prison color theme.

2266
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,040
No. It's very atmospheric.

2267
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,040
- A detention center.
- It will look luxurious with age.

2268
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,630
It's atmospheric
and you can't read the room.

2269
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:12,500
- No. Myeongdong Cathedral...
- That came out of nowhere.

2270
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,630
You are like hotteok.

2271
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,240
- He is lousy.
- Lousy.

2272
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,320
- I'll say, "I modeled my house..."
- He is lousy.

2273
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,410
- "after Myeongdong Cathedral."
- Suk Jin.

2274
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:24,340
We passed by Myeongdong Cathedral
many times in our 20s.

2275
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:25,880
But we never actually visited.

2276
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,790
- It's my first time...
- Suk Jin, repent.

2277
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:28,950
I am sorry.

2278
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,690
- What?
- I am sorry.

2279
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:32,250
Why didn't you come up here?
It isn't a long walk.

2280
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,250
Did you?

2281
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34,900
- No. But you frequented the area.
- Didn't you ever visit it?

2282
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,230
- We frequented the area.
- But we had a different purpose...

2283
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,270
- back then.
- But it's worth visiting.

2284
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:41,940
- We never visited it.
- We just knew it existed.

2285
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:44,830
Then why are you so absorbed
in memories?

2286
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:45,940
- It's because...
- I don't get it.

2287
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:48,040
It's because his first love
became a nun.

2288
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:50,840
Is it true or not?

2289
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,170
- Seriously.
- It's funny.

2290
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:53,240
- Is it a lie?
- It isn't true.

2291
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,670
- Is it a lie?
- It wasn't his first love.

2292
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:55,990
- It sounds like a fact.
- It isn't true.

2293
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:56,990
She was his second girlfriend.

2294
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:58,320
- His second girlfriend?
- No!

2295
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,450
- Nazareth.
- Nazareth.

2296
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:00,580
What's up with Nazareth?

2297
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,490
- It isn't true.
- Sister Nazareth.

2298
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,730
- It must have been hard.
- It isn't true.

2299
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:06,900
It's so nice.

2300
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:08,660
Let's ask the question.

2301
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:09,730
- Okay.
- Let's ask the question.

2302
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:11,960
- Children...
- How about them?

2303
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,090
(How about them?)

2304
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:14,130
- Foreigners?
- Yes.

2305
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:15,130
(There are foreigners
on the other side.)

2306
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,200
Are there foreigners?

2307
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,370
- Yes.
- I saw them earlier.

2308
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:20,540
What's most famous in Myeongdong?

2309
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,740
Can't we ask it like that?

2310
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:23,300
I will get going.

2311
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,120
(Suk Jin sets off confidently.)

2312
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,340
Hi.

2313
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:29,080
Excuse me.

2314
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,690
(Laughing)

2315
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:33,750
Where are you from?

2316
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,420
Where are you from?

2317
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,250
Can we not answer please?

2318
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:40,290
- Yes?
- Let's keep it a secret, okay?

2319
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:41,660
- Is it a secret?
- Yes.

2320
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,900
Yes.

2321
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,830
You think... Guess.

2322
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:52,440
In Myeongdong... Best. Famous. What?

2323
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,440
(Among foreigners, Myeongdong
is known for street food.)

2324
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,610
You want to know
what's best here in Myeongdong.

2325
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:56,780
Yes.

2326
01:14:56,780 --> 01:15:00,480
(Will he get the answer he wants?)

2327
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:02,020
Yes.

2328
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:04,120
People.

2329
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,290
- People.
- Yes.

2330
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,750
Okay.

2331
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:08,750
- People.
- Yes.

2332
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,360
- People. That's what you think.
- Yes.

2333
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,490
Okay.

2334
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,730
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

2335
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:17,620
- What did she say?
- I told her...

2336
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:20,160
that I want to know
the most famous thing in Myeongdong.

2337
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,540
- What did she say?
- Yes.

2338
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,960
She said,

2339
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,160
"People."

2340
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,110
- People?
- People. So we failed.

2341
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:27,670
It's a cool answer.

2342
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:30,300
- Isn't it cool?
- It's a cool answer.

2343
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,650
- It's a cool answer.
- It's very cool.

2344
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,450
- People.
- In her eyes,

2345
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,020
people are the most famous
in Myeongdong.

2346
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,020
(People are the most famous
in Myeongdong.)

2347
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:40,860
- It's so cool.
- Because of COVID-19, Myeongdong...

2348
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:41,860
was empty for a while.

2349
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,420
- Now, there are more people.
- That's right.

2350
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,530
At year-end...

2351
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:47,620
- Your shoulders...
- You could barely walk.

2352
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:48,620
- got bruised.
- Seriously.

2353
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,400
Shall we take a photo with people?

2354
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,240
- Let's keep it light.
- They can be in the background.

2355
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,270
- If they are too close...
- It's cool. People.

2356
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:56,270
- It's a cool answer.
- Come here.

2357
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:57,960
- People.
- It's a cool answer.

2358
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:58,980
People.

2359
01:15:58,980 --> 01:15:59,980
- People.
- People.

2360
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,950
- It's "Apple."
- Apple.

2361
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:03,370
- No. Apple.
- Apple.

2362
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:05,150
No. Don't raise the first syllable.

2363
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:07,480
- Apple. There you go.
- Apple.

2364
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,620
- Apple.
- There you go.

2365
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:11,380
Your choice. Famous.
Myeongdong. Talking.

2366
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,410
- It's hard. Listen.
- How about "Choice?"

2367
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:15,080
- Listen.
- Myeongdong. Famous. Your choice.

2368
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,190
- Say, "So many people."
- So many people.

2369
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,420
- So many...
- Listen to me.

2370
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,090
Listen to Big Sister.
So many people.

2371
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:22,790
- Apple.
- So many people.

2372
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:23,920
No.

2373
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,240
So many people.

2374
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,740
- No.
- People.

2375
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,160
- So many people.
- There are staff members.

2376
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,780
Let's take a photo with them.
People.

2377
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:33,800
- The cathedral is in the shot.
- In this shot,

2378
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,740
- we need people.
- Yes.

2379
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:37,700
- One, two, three.
- This is Myeongdong.

2380
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,820
One, two, three.

2381
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:42,190
- All of them are in the shot.
- People.

2382
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:45,160
Both the staff members
and passersby got included.

2383
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,080
- Let's ask well this time.
- Let's ask the question.

2384
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,380
Who will do it?

2385
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,290
Jong Kook hasn't done it once.

2386
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,120
- He should go next.
- Jong Kook.

2387
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,550
(Jong Kook will ask the question.)

2388
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:56,120
It will be nice
if we get coffee at that cafe.

2389
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,160
- Where?
- Coffee.

2390
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,330
- It would be so nice.
- They might answer right away,

2391
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:00,400
"That place."

2392
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,490
Where?

2393
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:02,540
Coffee.

2394
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,670
I will keep my head down,
so ask me the question.

2395
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:06,700
Okay.

2396
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:08,450
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

2397
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:10,780
What's most famous in Myeongdong?

2398
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:11,870
Coffee.

2399
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:14,450
Thank you.

2400
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,820
- Thank you.
- Doesn't that count?

2401
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,820
(Rain washed away their conscience.)

2402
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,990
(This time,
they search for a citizen.)

2403
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:21,020
Hello.

2404
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:23,880
- There you go.
- Hello.

2405
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:27,620
What's most famous in Myeongdong?

2406
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:32,200
(He asks the question to the man
who meets his eyes.)

2407
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:34,540
Myeongdong Cathedral.

2408
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,630
Myeongdong Cathedral.

2409
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:39,330
(Myeongdong Cathedral again)

2410
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,330
Hey.

2411
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:41,370
Thank you.

2412
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,340
- Thank you.
- Did you ask the question?

2413
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,910
- He said Myeongdong Cathedral.
- Jong Kook was supposed to ask.

2414
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:47,540
- What's going on?
- I was supposed to ask.

2415
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,340
- He said Myeongdong Cathedral.
- Who said that?

2416
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,540
- We didn't ask the question.
- Did you do something?

2417
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,360
- Jong Kook was supposed to ask.
- Hold on.

2418
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,020
You should have consulted us first.

2419
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,730
- Whom did you ask?
- Why did you do it on your own?

2420
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:57,330
- When did it happen?
- Did I do that?

2421
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:58,860
Yes. Go up there
and take another photo.

2422
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,830
- Thank you.
- We didn't do anything.

2423
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,900
- Thank you.
- Jae Suk ruined it.

2424
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,830
- Jong Kook was supposed to ask.
- Jae Suk.

2425
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:06,330
Why do you keep pooping?

2426
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:08,940
- Why did you do it on your own?
- He keeps pooping.

2427
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:10,370
- What was that?
- You are such a tyrant.

2428
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:13,540
We should leave the area
before we ask the question.

2429
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,150
- That's right.
- Jae Suk.

2430
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:16,410
I am exhausted.

2431
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:18,520
I can't believe Jae Suk.
He is like hotteok.

2432
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:20,780
(They go up the stairs again.)

2433
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:21,950
For goodness' sake.

2434
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,240
Why did you ask the question?

2435
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,620
- I mean...
- Jae Suk.

2436
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:27,120
- It was Jong Kook's turn.
- Say, "Hey" first.

2437
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,360
- Take a photo.
- Three.

2438
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,080
(They revisited the cathedral
in 5 minutes.)

2439
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,400
Let's go someplace far.

2440
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,360
- The man who is going down.
- Let's go.

2441
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,870
Jae Suk, how about
the man on the left?

2442
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,290
Let's go down the stairs first.

2443
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:38,770
If we do that,
we will end up here again.

2444
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:40,330
We should leave the area.

2445
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:42,610
Let's leave the area.

2446
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:43,700
(They decide to leave
the vicinity of the cathedral.)

2447
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,800
(Will it work
to their advantage or not?)

2448
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,300
Jong Kook should ask
the question now.

2449
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,480
Jae Suk.

2450
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:51,670
If we go that way,
there will be food.

2451
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:53,150
Let's go over there.

2452
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,150
Let's go to the place
where there is food.

2453
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:55,690
- Food.
- We need to see various dishes.

2454
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:57,190
- Let's leave the area.
- Let's see various dishes.

2455
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:00,710
Otherwise, we will keep going back
to Myeongdong Cathedral.

2456
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,750
There is a cafe.

2457
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,790
- I want to go there.
- I will succeed in this mission.

2458
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:05,790
- That's right.
- Wait.

2459
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,200
- Go ahead.
- Jong Kook, good luck.

2460
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,290
Okay. I will succeed in
this mission.

2461
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,900
Let's say, "We have been
to Myeongdong Cathedral."

2462
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,770
We can't say that.

2463
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:14,440
We can't say that.

2464
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,110
"We have been
to Myeongdong Cathedral."

2465
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:17,460
- Let's have a simulation.
- Okay.

2466
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:18,980
- Let's say you meet someone.
- Hello.

2467
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,700
Hello. What's the most famous
in Myeongdong?

2468
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,800
(Glancing around)

2469
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,020
(So Min glances around as well.)

2470
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,380
- There you go.
- It's a good tactic, right?

2471
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:31,540
You didn't think
of Myeongdong Cathedral, right?

2472
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,320
- Right? Let's glance around.
- Let's glance around.

2473
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,520
Let's go.

2474
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,080
- Get ready to go up again.
- Let's go to the food.

2475
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,730
The streets are busy again.

2476
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:40,660
It's so nice
that the place is crowded again.

2477
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,730
I hope we get street food.

2478
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:45,270
This is the place. Turn to the left.

2479
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,630
It has been a while
since I visited this place.

2480
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:48,660
Turn to the left.

2481
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:50,070
Turn to the left.

2482
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:52,000
- It smells amazing.
- The smell of Myeongdong.

2483
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,440
It looks delicious.

2484
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:56,000
- Tornado potato.
- Tornado potato would be nice.

2485
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:58,170
Let's ask the man who sells
the tornado potato.

2486
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:00,450
We can do that.

2487
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:02,840
- Jae Suk.
- The guy who sells the potato.

2488
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,880
We can ask him what's famous here.

2489
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:06,550
- It's crowded here.
- The smell of Myeongdong.

2490
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,020
It smells so delicious.

2491
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,250
Hello.

2492
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

2493
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,120
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Hello.

2494
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,950
- Okay.
- Hello.

2495
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:15,960
What do you want me to do?

2496
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:18,400
- Hello.
- Go ahead and take a picture.

2497
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:20,070
- Hello.
- It's been a really long time.

2498
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:21,770
I haven't been here for a long time.

2499
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:24,500
Didn't we play games here
in the early years of Running Man?

2500
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:26,280
Yes. We did the high jumping here.

2501
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,630
- That's right. We did it here.
- Right?

2502
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:29,280
- You're right.
- I remember that.

2503
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,450
- We did it on the street.
- There were a lot of people.

2504
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,740
Was it this place?

2505
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,540
It was here, right?

2506
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,710
I did the guy
who goes back in time here.

2507
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,820
Gaeko and I were a team.

2508
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:38,820
(A trip down memory lane)

2509
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:43,920
Do you remember this place?
There was the clothing store, Safety Zone.

2510
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,530
Right. Safety Zone.

2511
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,730
We're walking too much.

2512
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,290
- First...
- It's here.

2513
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:50,900
The cap he's wearing
is my favorite style.

2514
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,400
- Now...
- We should ask the question now.

2515
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,770
- You have to ask only one question.
- Okay.

2516
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:56,830
Go ahead and ask.

2517
01:20:56,830 --> 01:20:57,830
What's most famous in Myeongdong?

2518
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:00,170
What's the most famous thing
in Myeongdong?

2519
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:01,170
What's famous?

2520
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:02,740
- Who wants to ask?
- Who should we ask?

2521
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,340
- What about the man over there?
- The man over there.

2522
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:06,040
- He's smiling now.
- The man over there.

2523
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,240
Is it all right?

2524
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,240
(This might be their last chance,
so they are being more careful.)

2525
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:10,150
I think they will say
the cathedral again.

2526
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:11,650
- Old people would say that.
- They might say the cathedral.

2527
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:13,550
- Just do it as you please.
- Find someone young.

2528
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:14,950
Okay. Let's do this.

2529
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:16,080
- All right. Let's go.
- Who should we ask?

2530
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,250
Who is it? It's your choice.

2531
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,530
- Go ahead and pick one.
- Your turn.

2532
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:20,900
What about
the two young people over there?

2533
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:21,990
- Where?
- Here.

2534
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:23,990
- The ones on the left.
- Here.

2535
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:26,370
(A young couple catches
Se Chan's eyes.)

2536
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:27,370
Should we ask them?

2537
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:29,040
- Yes. Good.
- Let's do that.

2538
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,770
May I ask you something?

2539
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:32,370
(Nodding)

2540
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:35,340
Please. We just need
to eat one more dish.

2541
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,780
- Let's do this.
- Please.

2542
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,520
But something that's not too heavy.

2543
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,080
(They have to go to a restaurant
within 1,000 steps!)

2544
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:58,020
What's most famous in Myeongdong?

2545
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,660
We just need to eat one more dish.

2546
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,120
What comes to your mind?

2547
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,660
Myeongdong is famous
for its street food.

2548
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,780
(Myeongdong is famous
for its street food.)

2549
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:09,990
Street food? Which one?

2550
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:11,030
(Street food?)

2551
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:12,400
- Like what?
- Which one?

2552
01:22:12,730 --> 01:22:14,490
- Chicken skewers?
- Chicken skewers!

2553
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:16,330
- Chicken skewers!
- Chicken skewers!

2554
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,600
(It's food!)

2555
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,030
Chicken skewers!

2556
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,270
- Chicken skewers!
- Street food!

2557
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,810
- Chicken skewers!
- You're the best.

2558
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:25,030
- Chicken skewers!
- We can go home now.

2559
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:27,040
- He said chicken skewers.
- Chicken skewers.

2560
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,280
- I'm cold.
- I like the combination.

2561
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,620
Thank you so much.

2562
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:33,150
Okay.

2563
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:34,150
Let's go.

2564
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:36,210
Let's go.
I think we can find it there.

2565
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:39,530
- Do you like chicken skewers?
- Oh, yes.

2566
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,160
- Really?
- No.

2567
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,250
- Do you like chicken skewers?
- Yes.

2568
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,320
- Let's go.
- How many chicken skewers?

2569
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,270
How many chicken skewers
do you enjoy?

2570
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:49,460
- Yes.
- I hate chicken skewers.

2571
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,830
- You ate chicken skewers?
- You're a chicken skewer?

2572
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:51,870
I hate.

2573
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,330
- I see. You hate it.
- Why?

2574
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:55,030
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Why do you hate chicken skewers?

2575
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:56,500
Are you Vegeta?

2576
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,500
(They use
all the English words they know.)

2577
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,030
- Vegetarian?
- No, vegetarian.

2578
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:00,410
Are you Sun Wukong's friend, Vegeta?

2579
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:01,410
No.

2580
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:05,170
Haha says he hates chicken skewers.
He's a vegetarian.

2581
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,660
Jong Kook said this. "If you don't
want to get beaten up..."

2582
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:10,660
(Jong Kook said this. "If you don't
want to get beaten up...")

2583
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:13,030
"If you don't want to get beaten up,
just stay quiet."

2584
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,920
Gosh, he's so annoying.

2585
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,920
- Gosh. He is.
- So annoying.

2586
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,530
Hey, do you want to go crazy today?

2587
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,160
- Let's go crazy.
- Shall we get soaked?

2588
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,740
- Let's do that.
- Let's just get soaked.

2589
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,240
Haha.

2590
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,600
- Haha.
- Yes?

2591
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,500
(Taking it off)

2592
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,700
- You look tough.
- Hey, do you want to go crazy?

2593
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,000
(Hey, do you want to go crazy?)

2594
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,950
- Don't be ridiculous.
- My gosh.

2595
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,540
He looks really old.

2596
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:38,450
- "He looks really old."
- He really does.

2597
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:39,850
Where are chicken skewers?

2598
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,880
If we turn left here,

2599
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,250
we will find some snack carts.

2600
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,360
- Really?
- Yes.

2601
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,820
Let's turn left.

2602
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,880
- It's been so long.
- Turn left?

2603
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,700
- This feels so nice.
- There's something.

2604
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:52,700
Let's find chicken skewers.

2605
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,030
- I bet it's here.
- I think so.

2606
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,790
- It's not here.
- There are chicken skewers.

2607
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:58,030
- Where?
- Over here.

2608
01:23:58,130 --> 01:24:00,270
- There are chicken skewers.
- Okay.

2609
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,830
It's really here.

2610
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,330
- That's true.
- It's here.

2611
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,630
- It has everything.
- I can't believe this.

2612
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,950
- Hello.
- Hello.

2613
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,540
Hang on. Are these chicken skewers?

2614
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:10,450
- Don't you have chicken skewers?
- Are these chicken skewers?

2615
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:11,520
They are chicken skewers.

2616
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,150
(They are chicken skewers.)

2617
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:15,040
- Okay.
- Chicken skewers.

2618
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,160
I'll have the teriyaki one.

2619
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,360
I will have the salted one.

2620
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,730
All right.
Let's eat chicken skewers.

2621
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:21,060
(Myeongdong's specialty,
chicken skewers)

2622
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,530
- Is this a TV show?
- Yes. Thank you.

2623
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:24,660
- Two.
- We will have one more.

2624
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,990
- How much is this?
- How much?

2625
01:24:26,990 --> 01:24:28,990
The chicken skewers
are so delicious.

2626
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:30,030
(A super close shot)

2627
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:31,530
(Yoom)

2628
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:34,610
Do you sell the shine muscat too?

2629
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,130
Of course, I do.

2630
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:37,500
(Of course, I do.)

2631
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,410
- Well...
- Isn't that obvious?

2632
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:41,980
What else would it be?

2633
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,450
- Do you think it's decoration?
- What a silly question.

2634
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:45,710
What a lame question.

2635
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:47,910
When I see you on TV,

2636
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:50,020
the members treat you like this
all the time, so before I knew it...

2637
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,080
That's good.

2638
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,660
- "That's good?"
- That's good.

2639
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:55,060
Do you take a card, sir?

2640
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,750
- No.
- We will pay in cash.

2641
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,270
Suk Jin can wire the money.

2642
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,530
Suk Jin?

2643
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:01,990
Suk Jin, wire the money to him.

2644
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,270
Why are you glaring at me like that?

2645
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:05,630
What's wrong?

2646
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:08,570
How much is it? I'll wire the money.

2647
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:10,740
Here. Will you pay?

2648
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:12,330
(He has some cash.)

2649
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:13,910
No. If you have cash, you can pay.

2650
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:15,000
No.

2651
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:16,650
I was going to wire the money.

2652
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:18,150
- I think that's better.
- No.

2653
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:19,240
It's more meaningful.

2654
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,910
- Meaningful?
- We don't have to do that.

2655
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:22,860
I feel a lot better now.

2656
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:24,620
I'd like to wire the money, but...

2657
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:28,060
You are done
trying three different dishes.

2658
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:31,490
Now I will check your pedometers.

2659
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:33,230
(The final result)

2660
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:34,990
Are we going up again?

2661
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:40,740
(Course 1: Going up Mount Nam)

2662
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:41,910
I can't see it.

2663
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:42,980
There's no one.

2664
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:46,450
(Course 2: An exciting tour
around Namdaemun)

2665
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:50,910
(Course 3: The mire of
Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral)

2666
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:52,540
(The final result)

2667
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:53,950
(The total number of steps)

2668
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:57,250
It's 19,873 steps in total.
You succeeded.

2669
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:58,280
- What?
- Yes!

2670
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,280
The shoot is over.

2671
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,750
- Okay.
- Can we go home now?

2672
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,360
(Go home right away.)

2673
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,360
- Thank you.
- It's over.

2674
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,900
Let's do this again
when it's not raining.

2675
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,900
- Let's do that. It's fun.
- It was really nice.

2676
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,960
We should do this more often.

2677
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,440
- I even liked the rain.
- This was really nice.

2678
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,030
- The tour around Seoul was fun.
- It was even better in the rain.

2679
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:13,200
A tour around Seoul on a rainy day.

2680
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:15,310
It was a trip
down memory lane for Jae Suk.

2681
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:16,870
Thank you for your hard work.

2682
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:18,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2683
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:21,000
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

2684
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,540
Thank you all for your hard work.

2685
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:24,150
(We'd like to thank the citizens and
restaurant owners for their help.)

2686
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,520
I go like this.

2687
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:26,850
(A nimble fighter
with a bald head, Haha)

2688
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:28,240
(Speedy mouth, Yang Ssaebssaeb)

2689
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:30,660
(Why are you doing this?)

2690
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,410
(An uppercut with words,
Yoo Jae Suk)

2691
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,280
(A honey punch, Ji Suk Jin)

2692
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,160
(Weaving geniuses,
Zoned-out Crazy Sisters)

2693
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,230
(And Gym Jong Kook)

2694
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:39,400
Are you intimidated by Pacquiao?

2695
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,700
(The legendary boxer is coming?)

2696
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,990
(The stakes are getting bigger
with the news about the big game.)

2697
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:47,130
(Fighting fiercely over seats)

2698
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:48,830
(They are well prepared.)

2699
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:50,630
(The ring for a decisive battle)

2700
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:56,410
(A legendary boxer, Pacquiao)

2701
01:26:57,450 --> 01:26:59,150
(The world's first boxer
who conquered 8 weight divisions)

2702
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:01,240
(Pacquiao with the punch
worth tens of millions of dollars)

2703
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:02,540
- The name tag...
- He ripped it off.

2704
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:05,160
(But the members struggle
because of him?)

2705
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,660
(The best boxer's attack...)

2706
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,080
(continues on the ring.)

2707
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,230
(Nice to meet you, Running Man.)

2708
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:13,490
(Among those who get beaten up...)

2709
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:14,870
(There's one person
who can turn the tide.)

2710
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:16,830
- Okay.
- Good.

2711
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:18,130
(He's trained for a long time...)

2712
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:19,610
(only for this day.)

2713
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,030
(All Mighty)

2714
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:23,030
(Versus Word's best boxer)

2715
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,030
(Jong Kook is not giving way.)

2716
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:26,240
(And Pacquiao is driving him
into a corner.)

2717
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,650
- He's upset.
- He's caught.

2718
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:29,950
(How will the big match turn out?)

2719
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,410
(Show Me the Fight Money)

2720
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:32,410
