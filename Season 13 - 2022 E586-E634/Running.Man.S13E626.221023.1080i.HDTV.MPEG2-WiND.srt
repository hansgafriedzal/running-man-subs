1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,750
It's warm under the sunlight,

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,710
but it's chilly like early winter
in the shade.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,830
The weather is so nice.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,030
Hello.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,790
Yes, hello.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,960
Hello. The weather is lovely today.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,770
Hello, everyone.
This is Running Man. Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,300
This is where I start today.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,070
What's today's mission?

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,410
What are we doing today?
Why am I here alone?

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,180
I'll betray them.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,180
(Incoherent)

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,980
Hi, how have you been?

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,770
Hello.

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,090
- Isn't Pacquiao coming today?
- Yes.

16
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,280
All right. Pacquiao.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
(Pacquiao meets Yoo Jae Suk
on Running Man after 4 years.)

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,520
Second time, okay? You remember me?

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,020
One, two. One, two.

20
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,200
(The unprecedented legend
who conquered 8 weight divisions)

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,990
(The greatest boxer
in boxing history)

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,370
(The legendary boxer,
Manny Pacquiao is coming soon.)

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,880
In today's race,
R money will be important.

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,980
- R money?
- Yes.

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,380
So you will go and get
the seed money for the race.

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,020
The seed money?

27
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,250
We have three different places
ready in Yeouido.

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,250
Okay.

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,080
Each place offers 500, 700,
and 1,000 dollars.

30
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,560
The members who come to the same place
will share the money.

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,860
- Oh, dear.
- Think carefully before you decide.

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,440
This will be very tiring. My gosh.

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,440
I'm sure the tiger moths
will go for the 1,000 dollars.

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,500
I'm so sick of this.
I can see it already.

35
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,840
I know who will say,
"I'll go for the 1,000 dollars."

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,020
You will choose 1,000 dollars
anyway. That's what you do, right?

37
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,250
When I'm to choose between go and stop,
I always choose to go.

38
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,520
- I know.
- That's who I am.

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,110
I think there will be three
including Suk Jin.

40
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,080
So Min and you.

41
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,830
- Right.
- You should go with 1,000 dollars.

42
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,590
I'll choose between 700 and 500.

43
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,750
You should arrange things for me.

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,170
Okay. I'll take care of it.

45
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,860
- All right.
- I'm on it.

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,270
- Okay.
- Bye.

47
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,970
He's so docile.

48
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,440
(He's so docile.)

49
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,080
(A docile friend)

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,730
- Hey, Haha.
- Suk Jin.

51
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,340
What are you going to choose?

52
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,880
If you tell me
where you are going now,

53
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,180
I won't show up there.

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,880
- Really?
- Yes.

55
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,010
Where are you going?

56
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,660
I'll go for 1,000 dollars.

57
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,910
A thousand?

58
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,530
So you'll be there
no matter what, right?

59
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,500
That's my decision for now,
but I can't be sure.

60
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Suk Jin, can't you make it clear?

61
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,790
I'll go with 700 dollars.

62
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,690
- You want 700?
- I changed my mind.

63
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,760
I hope we won't meet
at the place for 1,000 dollars...

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,370
and embarrass ourselves.

65
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,160
- I'll go with 1,000 dollars.
- Let's slap each other in the face.

66
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,310
- If we meet up there.
- That's...

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,710
No, I'll go with 1,000 dollars.

68
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,810
If we meet at the place
for 700 dollars, you can slap me.

69
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,720
- Okay.
- If we meet at the place...

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,070
- for 1,000 dollars, I'll slap you.
- Okay.

71
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,810
All right.
I'll go for 1,000 dollars.

72
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,880
- I'll put my face on this.
- All right, Suk Jin.

73
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,190
- Bye.
- Bye.

74
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,190
(That's how
they decided their destinations.)

75
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,880
My face will be fine
as long as it's not flayed.

76
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,960
(A sudden change of heart)

77
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,320
This is not my first time.

78
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,720
My gosh.

79
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,130
I can even risk my family.

80
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,660
I'm so sick of this already.

81
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,030
I'm so annoyed, seriously.

82
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,160
I've had enough.

83
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,470
They all would think
the same thing as me.

84
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,340
"Jeon So Min will choose
1,000 dollars for sure."

85
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,410
(So Min is trying to use her brain.)

86
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,500
Today, I'll go for 500 dollars.

87
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,470
Think about it. If 4 people
go to the place for 1,000 dollars,

88
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,690
they get 250 dollars each.

89
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,560
They wouldn't come
to get 500 dollars.

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,280
I'm...

91
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,960
a strategist.

92
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,320
(Determined)

93
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,850
I bet Suk Jin and Jae Suk
will go for 1,000 dollars.

94
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,090
And Jong Kook will probably
go for 700 dollars.

95
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,470
Se Chan will go for 1,000 dollars,
but I'm not sure about So Min.

96
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,030
I don't know what she will choose.

97
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,870
Jong Kook will have to use
his fists today.

98
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,880
Jong Kook will...

99
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,530
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

100
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,910
Today, you can finally use
your fists legitimately.

101
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,010
Pacquiao is coming today.

102
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,910
Let's have a fight today.

103
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,540
I'll assist you today.

104
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,850
- Hey.
- Yes.

105
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,530
Pacquiao is younger than me, but...

106
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,930
Is he younger than you?

107
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,030
But I'll treat him
like an older brother.

108
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,960
(He will be polite to the man
who's 2 years younger than him.)

109
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,500
No, Jong Kook.

110
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,060
You should show him
what you've practiced.

111
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,760
With your one-two-three punch...

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,190
- Today...
- Hey, you know what?

113
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,370
You'll see me
get punched in the chin.

114
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,310
Jong Kook, I'm so excited today.

115
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,810
I know. This is nice.

116
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,940
- I love boxing.
- I know.

117
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,290
(That's how Se Chan chose
his destination without hesitation.)

118
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,420
Okay.

119
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,690
I'll finish him
with my one-two punch today.

120
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,950
Hello.

121
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,080
Today...

122
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,430
(Trifling shadow-boxing)

123
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,100
I'm meeting Pacquiao today.

124
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,370
- He's a national boxer.
- Really?

125
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,200
- Are you a national boxer?
- A former national boxer.

126
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,240
Really?

127
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,330
I'm meeting Pacquiao today.

128
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,540
I saw him earlier.

129
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,000
My friend went to see him,
but I have some work to do.

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,140
Really?

131
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,750
I saw you on TV.

132
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,350
You did? Nice to meet you.

133
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,640
- Can I take a photo with you?
- Sure.

134
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,810
(It's photo time.)

135
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,420
One, two, three.

136
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,010
What should I do
when I meet Pacquiao?

137
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,150
Can you give me any good tips?

138
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,150
First...

139
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,250
When you meet with him,
he will get ready to fight.

140
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,690
The basic posture of boxing.
Before that...

141
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,230
(A surprise attack)

142
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,740
I do this right away?

143
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,370
While you pretend to say hi,
just go like this.

144
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,630
- While saying hi to him?
- Then you go like this right away.

145
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,830
While saying hi?

146
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,460
Is this the place for 1,000 dollars?

147
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,310
Hang on.

148
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,750
There's Se Chan.

149
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,380
Why is he interviewing people
on the street?

150
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,440
Thank you.

151
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,150
(Running)

152
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,520
What? You startled me.

153
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,060
Gosh, I was startled.

154
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,320
- Hello.
- Jae Suk.

155
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,630
I just met the head
of the Boxers Association.

156
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,040
- The Korean Boxers Association?
- When I was doing this,

157
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,060
he knew I was
going to meet Pacquiao.

158
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,370
He told me to jab at Pacquiao
when he said hi.

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,180
As soon as I meet Pacquiao,
I throw a jab.

160
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,630
While saying hi to him, I jab him.

161
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,680
You've never met
Pacquiao before, have you?

162
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,880
This is my first time.
I'm so nervous.

163
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,990
Real martial artists like me...

164
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,010
Your fist smells sweet already,
Jae Suk.

165
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,580
- Hey.
- You'll attract bees.

166
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,320
If Suk Jin raises his hand
in Yeouido like this,

167
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,360
- Bees...
- bees will fill this area.

168
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,100
If Suk Jin raises
his fist like this...

169
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,830
- Bees will show up.
- Bees will show up.

170
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,060
Because it smells sweet.

171
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,460
- Are you here for 1,000 dollars?
- Sure.

172
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,040
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

173
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,270
I'm here to get 500 dollars.

174
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,640
I'm the one
who will get 500 dollars.

175
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,420
I don't see anyone else here.

176
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,350
All right. Is it over?

177
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,350
Not yet. They are still moving.

178
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,580
Someone might come here.

179
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,950
I hope there won't be anyone else.

180
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,230
It should end here.

181
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,150
I like the Han River.

182
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,560
It's been a long time.

183
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,320
How did it end up like this?

184
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,800
I just came here,
and things happened this way.

185
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,960
Today...

186
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,040
(Will Jong Kook get
700 dollars just like this?)

187
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,330
Pacquiao is coming, so I guess...

188
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,170
luck is coming my way.

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

190
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,940
- It's us.
- Two.

191
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,380
- Please wait for a moment.
- Okay.

192
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,250
(If it ends like this,
they will get 500 dollars each.)

193
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,010
- Someone's here.
- Who is it?

194
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,790
Yang Se Chan.

195
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,850
(Honey Ji shows up.)

196
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,120
Is he really here?

197
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,860
Are you really here?

198
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
Here comes the honey fist.

199
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,630
- Look. It's him.
- My gosh.

200
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,690
- Do you know why he came here?
- Why?

201
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,170
He thinks this place will be fun.

202
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,870
- For fun?
- He's...

203
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,440
- He's unbelievable.
- That's who he is.

204
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,260
- He's here for the show.
- You can't be here.

205
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,500
- He's so weak.
- Hey.

206
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,200
If you fail to step on here,

207
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,200
- You can't.
- you can't get the money.

208
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,940
That's ridiculous.

209
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,810
- I'll block it.
- You have to come up here.

210
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,610
- That doesn't make sense.
- You have to come up here.

211
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,750
- If you fail, you get no money.
- I can get through this.

212
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,190
Darn it.

213
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,690
(The 2-on-1 match begins.)

214
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,560
The honey punch is here.

215
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,630
Bees, gather around.

216
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,860
Bees, the honey punch is here.

217
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,000
Honey punch...

218
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,820
You can't come in here.

219
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,940
- My gosh.
- So you really came.

220
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,870
- Of course.
- You changed your character.

221
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,330
- What character?
- What do you mean?

222
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,370
Hey, I knew you'd come here.

223
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,940
It's obvious who would come here.

224
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,610
- Once So Min comes...
- If this is it, it's fine.

225
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,380
- There's someone.
- No one should come.

226
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,810
Jae Suk, someone else is coming.

227
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,920
Who is it?

228
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,210
Is that Haha?

229
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,750
That's Haha.

230
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,440
Gosh, Suk Jin.

231
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,880
(Haha shows up.)

232
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,010
- Suk Jin.
- Hey.

233
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,490
- Go away.
- What is Haha doing here?

234
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,860
He's unbelievable.

235
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,730
I said I'd go for 1,000,
and you said you'd go for 700.

236
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,000
- My goodness.
- Why are you here?

237
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,230
So the places for 700 and 300...

238
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,070
- He put his cheek on this.
- Seriously...

239
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,630
- I told you not to come.
- You put your cheek on this.

240
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,400
- You came here despite the bet?
- You should get slapped.

241
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,240
- No, you should get slapped.
- It's you.

242
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,710
- Hey.
- You said you'd go for 700 dollars.

243
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,800
What are they doing?

244
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,610
- Why are they here?
- Why did you come?

245
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,950
You know what?

246
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,320
I did some thinking.

247
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,580
It's in my genes.

248
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,780
If I didn't come here, I'd go crazy.

249
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,850
I knew the three of you
would come here.

250
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,250
- That's my DNA.
- You shouldn't come here.

251
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,680
There was nothing to think about.

252
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,250
I chose this as soon
as I heard about the mission.

253
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,590
I gave up on him.

254
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,130
- But what about you?
- I said I'd come here.

255
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,460
We're meeting Pacquiao today.
I need money.

256
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,290
Is it this way?

257
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,520
(Ji Hyo arrives
near one of the spots.)

258
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,700
I don't know.

259
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,240
I don't know where it is.

260
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,030
My gosh.

261
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,760
(Is it the spot for 700 dollars
where Jong Kook is waiting?)

262
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,380
I hope Ji Hyo is not coming.

263
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,480
She said she'd come here.

264
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,850
She's here.

265
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,170
Gosh, it's her.

266
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,580
There's So Min.

267
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,320
- Ji Hyo.
- So Min.

268
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,510
You're here.

269
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,680
(Ji Hyo and So Min get
250 dollars each.)

270
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,750
You should go for 1,000 dollars.
What are you doing here?

271
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,150
There will be too many people.

272
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,130
- He got all the money.
- Four people have come...

273
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,660
- I can't believe this.
- to the spot for 1,000 dollars,

274
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,160
so you get 250 dollars each.

275
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,260
It's 250 dollars. That's not bad.
It's like 2 people for 500 dollars.

276
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,900
But Jong Kook got 700 dollars.

277
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,300
- So this is...
- No.

278
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,900
Ji Hyo and So Min
went for 500 dollars.

279
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,380
- Really?
- Ji Hyo and So Min.

280
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,450
- Why did you come here?
- It's just the way am.

281
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,010
The first choice has come to an end.

282
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,140
Is it over?

283
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,250
Really?

284
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,750
- You get 700 dollars.
- My gosh.

285
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,010
What are you talking about?

286
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,510
(Jong Kook gets 700 dollars
while others get only 250 dollars.)

287
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,650
Are you serious?

288
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,380
How did I get
700 dollars all to myself?

289
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,360
So the first choice
has come to an end.

290
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,920
We will give you another chance
to get more money.

291
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,160
(There's another chance
to get more money.)

292
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,630
You can choose
one of three spots again.

293
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,930
- Okay.
- This is enough.

294
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,970
- One more time?
- I won't move.

295
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,000
How much is it?

296
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,030
We will give you another chance
to get more seed money.

297
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,110
Extra money?

298
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,910
You can choose
one of three spots once again.

299
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,120
Extra money?

300
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,120
They wouldn't bother to move again.

301
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,280
- How many of them will move?
- We should move.

302
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,650
- I'm not going.
- How much is it?

303
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,280
- None of us will move.
- It's 1,000, 700, and 500 again.

304
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,630
I will stay put.

305
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,150
- This is where I live now.
- Haha, listen to me.

306
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,160
I'll make a deal with you.

307
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,370
If you give me 50 dollars,
I'll move.

308
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,500
- I can't do that.
- Then give me 30 dollars.

309
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,660
- Then...
- Otherwise, I'll stay.

310
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,470
- You should give him 50 dollars.
- Just give me 30 dollars.

311
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,400
- And I'll leave.
- If you give me 50, I'll leave.

312
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,530
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

313
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,770
- I want only 30 dollars.
- Give me just 50 dollars.

314
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,880
Wait. You two...

315
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,480
- should get only 50 dollars.
- Let's make it 30 each.

316
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,670
- Only 30 dollars each.
- Okay.

317
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,670
Give us 30 dollars each.

318
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,140
- Just make it 50 for you two.
- I won't leave.

319
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,180
- You should give them 10 dollars.
- Let's make it 30 each.

320
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,380
- Pay them.
- Why would I give them ten dollars?

321
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,820
- Just give us 30 dollars each.
- You spend only 20 dollars.

322
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,050
- Give me 30 dollars.
- Make it 30 dollars each.

323
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,550
If you come back here...

324
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,550
- No.
- What if you come back?

325
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,960
Say it to the camera here.

326
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,830
Say that you will pay 100 dollars
if you come back.

327
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,600
- Go ahead and say it.
- If you come back...

328
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,630
If I come back,
I'll pay 100 dollars.

329
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,740
If I come back,
I'll pay 100 dollars.

330
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,760
If I come back,
I'll pay 100 dollars.

331
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,470
- You did something, didn't you?
- You winked, right?

332
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,110
You crossed your fingers, right?

333
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,770
My fingers? I said it.

334
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,380
If you come back here,

335
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,080
you will let Pacquiao punch you
in the face twice.

336
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,270
Why would Pacquiao punch me?

337
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,010
You should do that
because you broke your promise.

338
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,510
- And you.
- Yes.

339
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,820
You will be separated
from your wife for two months.

340
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,180
Separated?

341
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,680
- For two months?
- If you come back.

342
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,780
- He's mean.
- Just don't come back.

343
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,150
- That's it.
- I'll take it.

344
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,020
I'll take it.

345
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,750
"I'll take it."

346
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,460
Su Jung, you know I'm joking, right?

347
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,870
It's a joke.

348
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,890
- Why is he being like this?
- Is it a joke?

349
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,070
Why is he being
like this these days?

350
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,660
- What do I do?
- I'll stay here.

351
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,030
Should I go to number 2 or 3?

352
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,430
The other members are quite lazy.

353
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,170
So they wouldn't move.

354
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,770
They don't like to move around.

355
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,450
I bet Jong Kook will stay
at the spot for 700 dollars.

356
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,880
I think Jong Kook will stay there.

357
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,410
If I go there,
we get 350 dollars each.

358
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,680
That's not bad.

359
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,780
(Will they be able to come up
with a successful strategy?)

360
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,880
Should I go to number two?

361
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,680
They wouldn't bother to move.

362
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,860
(What's Jong Kook's choice
with a lot of R money?)

363
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,600
I already have 700 dollars.
I don't need to move around.

364
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,730
Don't you think so?

365
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,230
Let's play rock-paper-scissors,
and the loser will leave.

366
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,630
- Go somewhere else.
- Okay.

367
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,430
- Okay? The loser will leave.
- Let's do that.

368
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,430
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

369
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,340
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

370
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,400
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

371
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,710
- You go.
- Go.

372
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,430
Haha, you have to go.

373
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,530
You have to leave.

374
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,400
- Just go.
- Go away.

375
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,270
- We have no other choice.
- Go away.

376
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,380
- Should I go?
- Should we give him 30 dollars?

377
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,590
- I'm leaving.
- Go.

378
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,910
Go ahead and leave.

379
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,990
- I'm leaving. Don't come.
- Okay.

380
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,620
(Between 700 and 500,
which one will Haha choose?)

381
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,360
- Will you leave?
- Because...

382
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,860
Say it to the camera.

383
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,360
- I promise...
- You'll pay 100 dollars.

384
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,390
to pay 100 dollars.

385
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,420
You'll receive 30 dollars...

386
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,730
- Right. Yes.
- You'll receive 30 dollars...

387
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,870
- If you come back here...
- I'll receive 30 dollars...

388
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,260
- If you come back here...
- and pay 100 dollars if I return.

389
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,470
Good. Say you promise.

390
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,500
Say it.

391
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,610
- I promise.
- Okay.

392
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,900
- Say you promise to your parents.
- I promise.

393
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,800
I'll leave
if you give me 50 dollars.

394
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,800
- Really?
- Give me 50 dollars, and I'll go.

395
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
- Fifty dollars?
- Yes.

396
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,140
- Can I believe you won't be back?
- I won't come back.

397
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
- You won't come back?
- I won't.

398
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,820
Okay. Then you give him 30 dollars.

399
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,450
- I'll give him 20.
- Me?

400
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,720
- No, you give him 30 dollars.
- Ok, fine.

401
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,460
- Promise you won't come back.
- I promise I won't come back.

402
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,510
Say it to the camera.

403
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,680
- I promise I won't come back.
- Good.

404
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,730
(Crossing his fingers)

405
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,460
- Say, "If I come back,"
- If I come back,

406
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,390
- "I'll be no longer human."
- I'll be no longer human.

407
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,570
Okay. But I think
he might give up on being human.

408
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,930
- Okay. Here.
- Okay.

409
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,530
- Here you go. Give him the money.
- Don't come back, okay?

410
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,710
- Give him 30 dollars as you said.
- Give me the money now.

411
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,500
- You go first.
- Let's do it on the count of three.

412
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,170
Let's put the money in each hand.

413
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,500
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

414
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,850
- I gave him.
- Give me the money.

415
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,170
- Go now.
- Okay. I'm leaving.

416
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,640
Go. Okay. He left.

417
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,910
(Jae Suk received 50 dollars
and left.)

418
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,250
Then shall I look around
and come back?

419
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,680
Leave already.
I'll give you 30 dollars if you go.

420
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,150
Sounds good. Okay. Thirty dollars.

421
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,590
Will you leave
if I give you 30 dollars?

422
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,730
I'll have an extra ten dollars.

423
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,650
- Okay. Sorry?
- It's ten dollars. I'll leave.

424
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,230
- You'll get 30 dollars and leave?
- Yes.

425
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,130
- Really?
- I'll go if I get 30 dollars.

426
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,630
- Say you promise to the camera.
- I promise.

427
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,070
- Say, "If I come back,"
- If I come back,

428
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,570
- "I'll give him 100 dollars."
- I'll give him 100 dollars.

429
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,600
Okay.

430
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,160
- Here.
- Let's do this!

431
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,300
Okay. Go.

432
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,980
(Crossing his fingers)

433
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,300
- I made them all leave.
- Jae Suk.

434
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,140
I still have 190 dollars left.

435
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,410
(He spent 60 dollars
on sending away the troublemakers.)

436
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,250
Since Pacquiao is coming here,
I need plentiful R money...

437
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,010
Let's begin with plentiful R money.

438
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,130
This is so cool and refreshing.

439
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,360
Jae Suk.

440
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,730
I made an extra ten dollars.

441
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Great.

442
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,070
- Will you go back there?
- Of course.

443
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,600
(He had no intention of leaving
from the get-go.)

444
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,070
- I made an extra ten dollars.
- Yes.

445
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,290
I'll go back there.

446
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,610
- You made an extra 50 dollars.
- Yes.

447
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,130
- I crossed my fingers.
- I mean...

448
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,350
If there are two members
at each of the other places...

449
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,670
- Half of 700 is 350, right?
- It's 350.

450
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,670
If one of us goes there...

451
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,380
Then it should be divided by three,
so each won't get much.

452
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,680
- It'll be two hundred and...
- Three...

453
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,990
Seven times three...

454
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,460
Why would you multiply the number?

455
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,780
I mean, divided by three.

456
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,360
- Anyway, it's better to stay here.
- Five times three equals fifteen.

457
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,550
We'll go back when Suk Jin
couldn't be more excited.

458
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,630
Sounds great.

459
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,390
- It means you lied.
- I said I was lying.

460
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,570
- Suk Jin wasted his money.
- Exactly.

461
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,160
Hey, why aren't you guys leaving?

462
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,390
- Why?
- Why haven't you left yet?

463
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,530
Hey!

464
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,610
- What?
- Why haven't you guys left yet?

465
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,930
- The weather is so nice.
- Yes, that's why we're here.

466
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,610
The weather, my foot.
Gosh, those punks.

467
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,510
I have a feeling
that they're up to something.

468
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,510
Are you having an indoor shoot
with Pacquiao?

469
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,010
You must be really excited
to meet Pacquiao.

470
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,460
I can't think of anything else.
All I can think about is...

471
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,220
that I want to make good memories
with Pacquiao.

472
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,460
I want to get his autograph,
but I don't have any boxing gloves.

473
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,100
I can't believe I'll meet Pacquiao.
I'm so excited.

474
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,470
- Oh, my.
- Guys, leave now, will you?

475
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,240
- We're chatting. Don't mind us.
- Suk Jin.

476
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,870
- What's wrong? We're having a chat.
- Why won't you leave?

477
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,210
Don't mind us.

478
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,880
We're enjoying the weather.
That's all.

479
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,900
Gosh. They'll probably run here.

480
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,880
Obviously, they're planning
to come back. Gosh, seriously.

481
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,220
Why must they be so sly?

482
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,250
Three minutes are left.

483
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,090
Hey, don't come here.

484
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,780
(The staff members rush
to the pavilion as expected.)

485
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,120
Hey, they're still here.

486
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,720
(But someone else came here?)

487
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,950
- So Min, I knew you'd come here.
- Gosh.

488
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,510
- I knew it.
- Why didn't you go?

489
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,380
- Go where?
- Why... Where is Haha?

490
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,510
- Haha left.
- He did?

491
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,750
- Hey.
- I'm relieved.

492
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,020
- Where did Haha go? Number three?
- What do you mean you're relieved?

493
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,800
- Oh, that's good.
- Hey, what are you two doing now?

494
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,300
Is this a joke or something?

495
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,200
- Hey. Stop.
- Why?

496
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,860
- What's wrong?
- Are you kidding me?

497
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,260
- Why?
- Are you kidding me?

498
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,200
- What's wrong?
- A promise is a promise, you punks.

499
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,810
- But we... She's going up there.
- What are you doing right now?

500
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,230
- Hello.
- She didn't make any promises.

501
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,540
- I crossed my fingers.
- Gosh. We all gathered here.

502
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,550
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I thought Se Chan would leave.

503
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,450
- Give me 100 dollars.
- I crossed my fingers.

504
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,740
Give me 100 dollars right now!

505
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,790
No. I crossed my fingers.

506
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,550
- I crossed my fingers.
- That's ridiculous.

507
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,660
- You owe me 100 dollars.
- I lied.

508
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,320
- I wanted to choose 700 dollars.
- I see.

509
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,160
- Then why did you come here?
- I thought Haha and Se Chan...

510
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,520
- would choose the place too.
- The second choice has ended.

511
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,900
- How did it go?
- The number of members...

512
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,670
who chose this place is five.

513
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,230
- What? How?
- Five.

514
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,400
(But we're four people.)

515
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,940
- Is Haha here?
- Why didn't you leave?

516
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,830
- What's his problem?
- You two left earlier.

517
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,570
- Why didn't you leave?
- Is Haha here?

518
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,070
- What's his problem?
- You two left earlier.

519
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,270
(Haha appears.)

520
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,920
- I left as I promised.
- Seriously, what's wrong with him?

521
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,680
I was hiding under the pavilion.

522
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,510
(Haha promised to leave,
but actually...)

523
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,580
I'm so upset.

524
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,220
How about I hide somewhere
and go back?

525
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,520
(He got upset
and refused to keep his promise.)

526
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,820
Think about it. Haha,

527
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,400
Se Chan, and Jae Suk left.

528
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,670
(So Haha had been hiding
under the pavilion all along.)

529
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,970
I was hiding under the pavilion.

530
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,670
Why didn't you two leave
after getting paid?

531
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,370
- Why didn't you leave?
- Is there one member at each place?

532
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,730
Am I the only one?

533
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,380
- Do I get all of it again?
- Yes, 700 dollars.

534
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,970
This is crazy.

535
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,150
What's wrong with them?

536
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,650
Gosh. So this is how shallow...

537
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,010
- the 13 years of our friendship is.
- I crossed my fingers too.

538
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,070
- It's not about our friendship.
- I'm so upset. Give me the money.

539
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,480
- Give me the money right now.
- I'll give you 200 dollars each.

540
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,190
- Okay.
- Haha, why did you do that?

541
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,510
Ji Hyo has 750 dollars.

542
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,890
And Jong Kook has 1,400 dollars.

543
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,550
They'd be rich if they get married.

544
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,660
(1. Jong Kook: 1,400 dollars,
2. Ji Hyo: 750 dollars)

545
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,050
Whenever we do this,
I end up feeling bitter.

546
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,060
- I can't believe he got all of it.
- I mean...

547
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,820
Knowing your personalities,

548
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,760
I knew you guys would fight
until you all lost.

549
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,910
- He always sticks to the same plan.
- I knew he would stay there.

550
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,270
But if you had been reasonable,
you would've come to where I was.

551
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,180
- I mean, considering everything...
- We went beyond that point.

552
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,970
We went beyond the point
where we fight until we all lose.

553
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,070
This is what we're like now.

554
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,510
"What is wrong with you?"

555
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,580
- "Why are you here?"
- I would say,

556
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,850
- "What is your problem?"
- You're unreasonable.

557
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,980
- Right?
- Yes, we're unreasonable.

558
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,580
- We don't think reasonably.
- We're unreasonable.

559
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,360
If you had thought reasonably,
you would've...

560
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,580
- made a different choice.
- I thought he had left.

561
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,320
We played rock-paper-scissors,
and he left.

562
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,990
And I gave them 30 dollars each
to leave.

563
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,670
- But...
- I came down and hid under here.

564
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,990
I was going to come out
when the two of them left.

565
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,060
- Then I could get 500 dollars.
- Right.

566
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,110
- I thought it was worth trying.
- Yes.

567
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,450
But the two of them didn't even
run away or hide anywhere.

568
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,570
They were just standing here.

569
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,210
They were just chatting.

570
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,850
- What was that? I was so upset.
- They're like thugs.

571
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,150
They refused to leave.

572
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,240
- Really?
- Yes.

573
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,420
- They had no intention of leaving.
- I could see them.

574
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,480
- They didn't even hide?
- You see,

575
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,050
Jong Kook didn't win the money...

576
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,250
- because he had a good strategy.
- Yes.

577
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,430
- That's not true.
- It was possible...

578
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,250
because we always make it easy
for him to win.

579
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,250
That's true.

580
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,960
- "Help yourself."
- True.

581
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,670
- That's embarrassing.
- We set it all up for him.

582
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,940
Then we start fighting
over food on a much smaller table.

583
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,170
- You know what I mean, right?
- That's true.

584
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,910
- That's precise.
- We pick up food on the ground.

585
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,410
- And we tell each other...
- Exactly.

586
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,610
- where we'll be.
- Food fell on the ground!

587
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,640
(The tiger moths barely survive
by eating food off the ground.)

588
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,910
- This is what it's like.
- Hold on.

589
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,350
- It's frustrating.
- What did you say?

590
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,420
Does R money play an important role?

591
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,240
- It's Show Me the Fight Money.
- Oh, boy.

592
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,220
Before each round,
you turn in fight money.

593
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,550
- I see.
- You get twice as much if you win.

594
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,550
And you lose the money you turned in
if you lose.

595
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,160
- Okay.
- I've already made my decision.

596
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,470
I'll go all-in in the first round.

597
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,790
I bet he'll lose all his money...

598
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,490
- and beg us for money.
- Jae Suk, please.

599
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,370
- Don't do that.
- You really should stop doing that.

600
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,370
I beg you.

601
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,000
Can you get me a costume?

602
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,800
- I'll dress like a beggar.
- I'm sure he'll do it again.

603
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,000
It'll be just like the game
where we chose between Go and Stop.

604
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,040
- Really?
- Yes.

605
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,650
- He'll push forward no matter what.
- My point exactly.

606
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,880
There will be a war of nerves
between him and the staff.

607
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,040
- I'll just go for it.
- Go for it no matter what.

608
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,780
With your fight money,

609
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,160
you can purchase
a penalty exemption card.

610
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
- There will be a penalty.
- Or you'll get a penalty.

611
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,020
- A penalty? Gosh.
- Oh, boy.

612
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,630
You can win the first game
if you get lucky.

613
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,990
- Before we begin,
- I'm not so lucky.

614
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,170
turn in as much money as you want
as the registration fee.

615
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,830
We have to be in the top three?

616
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,230
- It requires good eyesight?
- I...

617
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,530
- No. You need good luck.
- Oh, good luck?

618
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,570
- Luck?
- Oh, we need good luck?

619
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,070
- Then I'll go all-in.
- I'll bet 200 dollars.

620
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,500
- Two hundred dollars?
- For the first round.

621
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,240
- You're betting 200 dollars?
- Yes.

622
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,740
- Really?
- Two hundred dollars?

623
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,080
- It's all about fighting spirit.
- I should win this.

624
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,750
It's all about fighting spirit.

625
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,080
- I'll bet 300 dollars.
- Really?

626
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,980
- I'll bet 300 dollars.
- You'll bet 300 dollars?

627
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,360
Hey...
So Min, you shouldn't do that.

628
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,660
It's okay. I could get lucky.

629
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,760
- Even so...
- I need to get more money.

630
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,670
She bet too much money.

631
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,290
Let me think.

632
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,260
If you want to get more money...

633
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,170
I'll see how it goes this time.
I'll bet only 100 dollars.

634
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,500
- I'll bet 100 dollars.
- Here's 100 dollars. Yes.

635
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,640
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, and Suk Jin bet
100 dollars just as Jae Suk did.)

636
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,210
- To be honest...
- I'll bet 50 dollars.

637
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,270
- Fifty dollars?
- Yes.

638
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,470
- This game requires luck, right?
- Yes.

639
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,220
- Good. Let's do this.
- He bet 100 dollars.

640
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,780
We have a good chance of winning
because we'll have three winners.

641
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,450
He's right. We have a good chance.

642
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,740
Yes. The top three will get money.

643
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,120
What's scary is
that none of us is lucky.

644
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,320
- The game you'll play is...
- That's good.

645
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,280
Random Korean Style Bowling.

646
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,290
- What is it?
- Random Korean Style Bowling?

647
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,790
You have 30 seconds to spin
your head wearing a sangmo...

648
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,520
- and knock down...
- Got it.

649
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,230
- as many pins as you can.
- I see why we need luck.

650
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,900
- I'm worried.
- The object tied to your sangmo...

651
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,940
- will be chosen randomly.
- I see.

652
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,800
(They will do the sangmo dance?)

653
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,450
- The top three will receive...
- What should I do?

654
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,850
- twice as much money as you bet.
- Okay.

655
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,620
- Okay. It's not about luck.
- It's not about luck.

656
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,980
I don't think I can win this.

657
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,190
I'm in trouble.

658
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,690
- Why did you bet 300 dollars?
- You know what a sangmo is, right?

659
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,780
I know what it is, but...

660
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,960
- This is not about luck.
- The object tied to your sangmo...

661
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,190
Doesn't it require flexibility?

662
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,290
- No. The object is important.
- It requires luck.

663
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,360
It'd be hard to knock the pins down
with some tissues.

664
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,520
Starting with Ji Hyo,
you'll choose your sangmo.

665
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,530
(Ji Hyo is the first
to choose the sangmo.)

666
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,760
Pick one ball.

667
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,610
Darn it.

668
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,870
(She's upset about the result.)

669
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,710
Gosh. How am I going to win
with an anchovy?

670
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,450
Ji Hyo chose an anchovy
as her object.

671
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,150
(Ji Hyo chose an anchovy.)

672
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,890
- An anchovy?
- An anchovy?

673
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,580
- No. It's not so bad.
- How can she win with an anchovy?

674
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,780
- An anchovy won't work.
- That's not going to work.

675
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,980
I can't believe she has to do it
with an anchovy.

676
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,550
Exactly. It's not possible.

677
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,550
She just has to be in the top three,
so it's not that bad.

678
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,720
An anchovy?

679
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,790
Just one anchovy.

680
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,490
Ji Hyo, I think you can pull it off.

681
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,790
- I don't think so.
- Shut your mouth, you punk.

682
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,530
- Is it possible?
- You see, anchovies are strong.

683
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,140
- Anchovies are rich in calcium.
- Nice. She might pull it off.

684
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,760
- Ji Hyo, you look cute.
- Is it spinning around?

685
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,300
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, you're doing a great job.

686
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,470
- Hey, it's no joke.
- Do we have to stand there?

687
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,710
- Ji Hyo, you've got this!
- Let's go!

688
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,970
- I can do this!
- Let's go!

689
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,300
- Go, Ji Hyo!
- You've got this!

690
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,040
- Ready. Go.
- Stop it. We're competing.

691
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
- I wonder if it works.
- No way.

692
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,620
- Hey. Oh, gosh.
- That won't ever work.

693
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,420
- Where are the pins?
- How much money did she bet?

694
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,960
- You have only 30 seconds.
- You can start in front of them.

695
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,160
- Ji Hyo, go closer to the pins.
- You're running out of time.

696
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,810
- Start at the pins.
- Why did I start back there?

697
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,820
Hey, while spinning your head...

698
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,250
- Its head is stuck on your sweater.
- Oh, no.

699
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,050
Gosh. It's on her back.

700
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,790
- It's been separated from its body.
- The head fell off.

701
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,790
- It's too light to knock them down.
- Ji Hyo, it doesn't work.

702
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,990
- Ji Hyo, it's over.
- She only cut its head off.

703
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,990
(Ji Hyo, it's over.)

704
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,470
- Ji Hyo, it's over.
- She only cut its head off.

705
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,470
(Darn it!)

706
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,470
(Bad Ji Hyo showed up
after a long time.)

707
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,380
- It's over. The head fell off.
- Hey, an anchovy is ridiculous.

708
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,730
You try it and see if it works.

709
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,610
This darn anchovy. Get lost!

710
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,450
She looks like a drunkard
from behind.

711
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,770
You looked like Taoist Mutul.

712
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,690
- Hey!
- You're so cool, Ji Hyo.

713
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,360
- The second player, please come.
- Shall I choose mine?

714
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,780
- They keep it fair.
- Is the anchovy...

715
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,720
considered a good or bad tool?

716
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
- A bad one.
- Of course, it's a bad tool.

717
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,130
A bad one? Right.

718
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
It says "Fan."

719
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,370
- A fan?
- He chose a fan?

720
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,520
- A fan is good.
- What kind of fan is it?

721
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,430
- A fan is good.
- No, it's not.

722
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,440
It's not so good.

723
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,170
- Well, it's not so bad.
- It'll be hard to move it.

724
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,170
- That won't work. Jong Kook.
- It will be hard.

725
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,770
- Sorry, but I don't want to win.
- Oh, no.

726
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,380
- Okay. You have a lot of money.
- Yes.

727
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,380
I like your positive attitude.

728
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,680
- Right.
- I'm doing this for fun.

729
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,570
- How much did you bet?
- I bet 100 dollars.

730
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,770
- Jong Kook is so meek.
- Yes.

731
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,690
- I mean, he's...
- I'm not doing this for money.

732
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,250
- He's so meek that he's not greedy.
- He's not competitive.

733
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,890
- He looks even meeker in that hat.
- Of course.

734
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,250
He's really meek.

735
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,550
- Oh, he can't move it around.
- I can't move it as I want.

736
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,100
- It doesn't work.
- It's too light.

737
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,600
(Laughing)

738
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,170
(Cheerful)

739
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,170
- He's so meek.
- That won't work.

740
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,700
- This is fun.
- Right. It's hard.

741
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,060
- I said it wouldn't work.
- Ready.

742
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,230
- Oh, good. You might...
- Set.

743
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,060
- Go.
- I wonder if I can pull it off.

744
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,230
No, it won't work.

745
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,440
- I think he'll pull it off.
- There's no way.

746
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,380
- I don't think it'll work.
- Oh, it works.

747
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,300
- Oh, it works.
- You should spin your head...

748
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,680
like the sangmo dance instead of
moving it from side to side.

749
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,040
- There's no way.
- Oh, he knocked one down.

750
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,420
(He began to knock the pins down.)

751
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,620
- I'm impressed. He pulled it off.
- He pulled it off.

752
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,190
- He pulled this off too.
- I can't believe he pulled it off.

753
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,720
- Will he knock down more pins?
- I can't believe this.

754
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,320
- Hey, you should spin it around.
- This is unbelievable.

755
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,080
- He's amazing.
- Spin your head.

756
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,790
I'm sick of seeing him
pulling things off.

757
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,220
- I can't believe this.
- Gosh.

758
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,820
(Please stop!)

759
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,200
- Hey.
- Stop!

760
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,260
Jong Kook.

761
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,700
Time's up.

762
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,800
(The game is over.)

763
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,260
Time's up.

764
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,070
I can't believe he pulled it off.

765
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,300
- I took it easy.
- You knocked nine pins down.

766
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,450
- Did I?
- Yes, nine pins.

767
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,180
- My gosh. He pulled it off.
- You know...

768
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,570
He'll place 1st
if he knocked 9 pins down.

769
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,070
I took it easy.

770
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,510
- I'm not lying.
- I'll choose my tool.

771
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,780
(Next up is Haha.)

772
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,780
Here.

773
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,080
- Yes.
- Okay.

774
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,810
- Haha chose a sausage.
- Nice!

775
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,360
(Haha chose a sausage.)

776
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
It's not bad at all.

777
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,430
Mine is a sausage. I can win this.

778
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,790
A sausage is quite good.

779
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,990
- That's a great tool.
- It's awesome.

780
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,720
- I'm going to win.
- He could place first.

781
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,430
- He'll place first.
- He looks scary.

782
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,670
Is he Wong Fei Hung?

783
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,060
Hey, he looks...

784
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,560
(Ha Fei Hung with a sausage queue)

785
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,140
- Why don't you open up...
- He looks good with short hair.

786
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,570
a lamb skewer place instead of
running a barbecue restaurant?

787
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,070
- A lamb skewer place?
- You're doing it wrong.

788
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,970
I'll take this out for a second.
Or else, it won't...

789
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,040
Hey, just leave it.
So Min, why did you help him?

790
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,190
- Why?
- You're good to go.

791
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,890
We're competing with one another.

792
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,280
- I'll lend you some money.
- Okay.

793
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,860
What's wrong with you?

794
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,390
I must say, Suk Jin is so...

795
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,080
This isn't a group mission.

796
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,700
- I'm ready.
- Get it together.

797
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,490
He's the worst.

798
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,100
- He said this was competition.
- Stay alert.

799
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,990
- You're ready, right?
- Yes.

800
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,440
Ready. Set. Go.

801
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,300
(The game begins.)

802
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,670
It'll work, obviously.
I'm sure of it.

803
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,230
- One.
- That's great.

804
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,830
- He's invincible.
- It's awesome.

805
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,970
- He's invincible.
- Yes, he's invincible.

806
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,970
- Move a little further forward.
- They're all falling down.

807
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,450
- A little further.
- They're all falling down.

808
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,390
- Almost all the pins fell down.
- That's amazing.

809
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,660
He's in first place already.

810
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,550
- He's the winner.
- Of course.

811
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,720
He kicked the mat.

812
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,290
- He kicked it.
- Deduct one from his record.

813
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,700
- He'll place first.
- He's the winner.

814
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,630
- Deduct one from his record.
- He knocked them all down.

815
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,560
- Of course, he'll win.
- That was amazing.

816
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,790
- We'll accept 20 pins.
- The sausage was the best one.

817
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,870
I bet he'll place first.

818
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,970
- A chocolate biscuit.
- Oh, okay.

819
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,770
Se Chan chose a chocolate biscuit.

820
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,270
That's good.

821
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,470
He's knocked 4 pins down so far.
Oh, 5 pins.

822
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,770
(While scattering crumbs,
Se Chan knocked five pins down.)

823
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,380
All right. Dried pollack.

824
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,970
(Jae Suk chose a dried pollack.)

825
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,350
(He did well with his exceptional
sangmo dance skills.)

826
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,460
He's in second place.

827
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,480
- Dried seaweed? Is it good or bad?
- That's good.

828
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,460
- Suk Jin is lucky.
- It's good.

829
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,280
(1st: Haha, 20 pins, 2nd: Jae Suk,
18 pins, 3rd: Jong Kook, 9 pins)

830
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,460
Okay. Good.

831
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,900
(His sangmo fell off
as soon as he began.)

832
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,960
(4th: Se Chan, 5 pins,
5th: Ji Hyo, 0 pins)

833
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,170
Great. That'll work.

834
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,260
(1st: Haha, 20 pins, 2nd: Jae Suk,
18 pins, 3rd: Jong Kook, 9 pins)

835
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,170
(He gives off
a salty scent of seaweed.)

836
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,370
- He did well.
- Your record is 14 pins.

837
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,530
- Nice. Okay.
- Okay.

838
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,710
I'm in third place. I made it.

839
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,030
- Gosh, I'm dizzy.
- So Min, you bet 300 dollars.

840
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,140
- So Min, you bet 300 dollars.
- I'm done for.

841
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,270
I'm done for.

842
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,770
I hope she'll fail.
That will be funny.

843
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,350
- Gosh, I'm dizzy.
- How can I do it with this?

844
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,570
- What is it?
- A rose.

845
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,580
- That's good.
- It's not bad at all.

846
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,420
- It's great.
- Confess your love.

847
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,620
- It's a rose.
- Confess your love.

848
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,190
Wait. Okay. It's not so bad.

849
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,550
- It's not too light, right?
- It's not too light.

850
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,630
- Good.
- It's perfect.

851
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,160
The pins fall down easily.

852
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,050
- I want to win for a change.
- Ready.

853
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,550
Set. Go.

854
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,430
So Min.

855
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,290
- Oh, my.
- That's impressive.

856
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,170
(She knocks 2 pins down
with 1 hit twice in a row.)

857
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,060
(No way. She's actually knocking
them down)

858
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,300
- Good.
- Nice.

859
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,030
(The flower fell off the stem!)

860
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,410
- That's great.
- Oh, my.

861
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,180
- The flower fell off.
- It fell off.

862
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,770
(Separated)

863
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,350
- It fell off.
- The flower fell off.

864
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,780
The flower fell off. It's over.

865
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,810
- You should hurry up.
- The flower fell off.

866
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,250
- So Min will lose 300 dollars.
- The flower fell off.

867
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,690
- She bet 300 dollars.
- "My money!"

868
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,890
- She bet 300 dollars.
- She'll lose that money.

869
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,980
- So Min will lose 300 dollars.
- The flower fell off.

870
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,780
- She kicked two pins.
- There are many pins left.

871
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,490
- She'll lose the money.
- You can do it!

872
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,900
(Headbanging with no damage)

873
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,790
- The flower...
- You can do it!

874
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,400
- The flower fell off.
- She'll lose 300 dollars.

875
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,870
- She must be dizzy.
- You can't lose 300 dollars!

876
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,530
Oh, no. It's over.

877
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,610
(Goodbye, 300 dollars.)

878
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,180
- So Min lost 300 dollars.
- Oh, no.

879
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,300
- Yes!
- That was funny.

880
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,970
- Poor So Min.
- The flower fell off so early.

881
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,570
- The flower fell off.
- She lost 300 dollars.

882
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,180
- Oh, no.
- Gosh, my money. Hold on.

883
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,450
Darn. My money.

884
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,420
- You did a good job.
- You lost 300 dollars, So Min.

885
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,690
No, my money.

886
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,510
- The game is over.
- So Min, what's wrong with you?

887
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,550
Haha placed first.

888
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,190
- Since he bet 50 dollars,
- Gosh.

889
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,200
- That's so him. He bet 50 dollars.
- he'll receive one hundred dollars.

890
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,900
- I should've bet more money.
- You small fries.

891
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
- I should've bet more money.
- Did you bet 200 dollars?

892
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,490
- Jae Suk, you bet 100 dollars.
- Yes. I won 200 dollars.

893
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,030
- I should've bet more money.
- Suk Jin, you won 400 dollars.

894
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,640
- Yes.
- This is nice.

895
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,070
Now, we'll move to the next place.

896
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,140
- Okay!
- Let's go.

897
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,500
I should bet more money
in the next round.

898
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,880
I lost 300 dollars.

899
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,350
I'm going to make friends
with Pacquiao.

900
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,950
- Suk Jin, don't do that.
- Don't do that.

901
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,950
- Why?
- Don't make him uncomfortable.

902
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,580
- Don't make Pacquiao uncomfortable.
- He's right.

903
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,810
- Don't make him uncomfortable.
- I won't.

904
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,810
Tom Cruise won't come back to Korea
because of you.

905
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,190
- He hasn't come back since then.
- It's because of Suk Jin.

906
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,290
- He said he wanted to see me.
- Right.

907
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,160
- To whom did he say that?
- Sorry?

908
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,470
- But he won't come because of you.
- Right.

909
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,990
- Come on.
- Suk Jin, you shouldn't do that.

910
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,170
- He always does that.
- I mean, Pacquiao's child...

911
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,330
went to the same school as mine.

912
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,560
Don't make him uncomfortable.

913
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,300
- Come on.
- We have some things in common.

914
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,680
- Don't do that.
- Really?

915
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,450
His child and mine
went to the same school.

916
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,450
- I don't believe you.
- That's enough.

917
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,810
It's true
that they went to the same school.

918
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,510
- Pacquiao's child and mine.
- That doesn't mean...

919
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,240
- you're his friend.
- You didn't go to that school.

920
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,890
- He's not your friend from school.
- They went to the same school?

921
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,190
- My child...
- Hyun Woo.

922
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,550
- Oh, Hyun Woo?
- Yes, Hyun Woo.

923
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,080
- Exactly. That doesn't matter.
- Don't make him uncomfortable.

924
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,690
So I tried to find this photo
of my child with Pacquiao...

925
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,320
- that was taken back then.
- Stop it.

926
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,720
- But I couldn't seem to find it.
- Why would you look for it?

927
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,960
- Protect his privacy.
- Did you find the photo?

928
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,990
- No, I couldn't find it.
- I see.

929
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,100
What a relief.

930
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,990
- He couldn't find it. I'm relieved.
- He couldn't find it.

931
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,470
- What a relief.
- That's a shame.

932
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,670
Viewers in the Philippines,

933
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,530
- fortunately, he couldn't find it.
- Right. That's a relief.

934
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,880
- Please don't worry.
- I'm relieved.

935
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,500
- That's a relief.
- Indeed.

936
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,240
- I'm so relieved.
- It's because...

937
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,150
I like boxing, you know.

938
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,880
- You don't like boxing.
- Stop lying.

939
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,970
You never talked about boxing.

940
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,480
I really like boxing. I'm not lying.

941
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,690
- When did you ever talk about it?
- He's talking nonsense.

942
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,050
I even watched all his matches
including the most recent one.

943
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,050
- What match?
- What did you see?

944
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,550
The one between Pacquiao and...
Was his name Uruso?

945
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,520
- Urusa?
- No, I think his name is Uruso...

946
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,550
(Uruso?)

947
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,790
Suk Jin, did you say "Urusa?"

948
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,520
- Was it Uroson? What was his name?
- Who is Uruso?

949
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,870
Anyway, there's a boxer
with a name like that.

950
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,630
- His latest match...
- You mean, you cried?

951
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,970
- Right. That must be it.
- Did he cry to sleep?

952
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,970
In 2021...

953
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,560
- Did you cry? Were you very sad?
- Did you cry? When did you cry?

954
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,710
Hey, Seok Sam, when did you cry?

955
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,440
(They're teasing Suk Jin
by making a pun.)

956
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,710
Hey, Seok Sam, when did you cry?

957
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,350
- That was good.
- He's laughing out loud.

958
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,150
- I didn't cry.
- Didn't you cry?

959
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,690
- I didn't cry.
- When did you cry?

960
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,190
- I mean, Pacquiao...
- Did you cry because you were sad?

961
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,960
- I thought...
- Did you tear up and cry?

962
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,920
that Pacquiao's opponent's name
was Uroso.

963
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,790
I think
I'm quite excited to meet Pacquiao.

964
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,700
- Why?
- I'm feeling so hot right now.

965
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,170
- You're wearing thick clothes.
- Take off your cardigan.

966
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,600
- You're going through menopause.
- I'm feeling so hot.

967
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,790
You're going through menopause.

968
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,060
- It's so hot.
- You ran from the wasp earlier.

969
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,410
- I think that's why he's hot.
- Gosh. It's hot.

970
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,500
- He's going through menopause.
- No, that's not the case.

971
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,070
- Look at Suk Jin's arms.
- He ran around earlier.

972
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,680
- Oh, my.
- Look at his arms.

973
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,070
Stop it. I don't have muscular arms.

974
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,720
Did you cry because you didn't have
muscular arms?

975
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,880
- Did you cry?
- Did you cry?

976
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,580
- Were you surprised at my arms?
- Did you cry?

977
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,390
- Were you surprised or not?
- I was surprised.

978
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,580
I lost the muscles in my arms
because I stopped working out.

979
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,550
Jae Suk and Haha have met him.
Right?

980
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,550
- Yes.
- We've met him before.

981
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,550
He said Pacquiao was very nice.

982
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,720
- Yes, he was very nice.
- He looks like a nice person.

983
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,200
And he's been doing
a lot of charity work.

984
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,820
Mr. Pacquiao is very rich.
That's all you need to know.

985
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,440
- What?
- He's not older than you.

986
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,700
- He's not older than you.
- He's rich, so he has seniority.

987
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,030
I'll treat him like a big brother.

988
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,970
- He's a good fighter and rich.
- Exactly.

989
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,060
- Like a big brother.
- He meets all the qualifications.

990
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,180
- He's rich, so he has seniority.
- He's...

991
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,140
He's incredibly rich, you know.

992
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,650
He won champion belts
in eight different weight classes.

993
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,710
- In eight different weight classes.
- Oh, my.

994
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,240
- In different weight classes?
- He's such an amazing boxer.

995
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,620
I can't wait.

996
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,120
We're all warmed up now.

997
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,690
(They arrive excited
to meet Pacquiao.)

998
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,280
(One, two!)

999
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,390
Ji Hyo, be like this.

1000
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,250
Bend down like you're bowing
but throw a punch.

1001
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,750
He'll be a little scared
by my punch, right?

1002
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,400
- He'll at least flinch.
- Are you serious about it?

1003
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,790
Yes, I'm going to punch him today.

1004
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,130
Did you all hear that?

1005
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,820
He's going to punch Pacquiao today.

1006
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,440
Would he have
a lot of bodyguards around him?

1007
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,330
- He has many.
- Really?

1008
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,410
It's no good, then.

1009
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,640
He's here.

1010
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,410
He's here.

1011
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,710
(Did Pacquiao suddenly appear?)

1012
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,880
Hello.

1013
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,150
- I'm not him.
- Hello.

1014
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,720
- I'm Yang Se Chan.
- Do you remember me?

1015
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,950
(He greets Yang-quiao.)

1016
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,740
- Wait, are you Haha?
- Yes.

1017
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,720
- Hello, my name is So Min Jung.
- Yes, So Min.

1018
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,580
Jung So Min. Nice to meet you.

1019
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,480
I shouldn't be cheeky today.

1020
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,430
Can you...

1021
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,470
please edit out the shadowboxing
I did beneath the bridge?

1022
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,290
- What's shadowboxing?
- Why did I even do that?

1023
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,330
By the looks of it,
Pacquiao must be near.

1024
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,330
(Jae Suk and Seok Sam
also join them.)

1025
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,440
Right? You can hear
people murmuring.

1026
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,710
- He must be coming from there.
- That must be it.

1027
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,180
I get to greet him first.

1028
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,210
Is he already here?

1029
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,410
- My brother.
- I don't think so.

1030
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,420
- He'll be here soon.
- Already?

1031
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,770
I'm nervous.

1032
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,390
If you think about it,

1033
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,890
- he should be here by now.
- Yes?

1034
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,390
- Is it time?
- Of course.

1035
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,580
- I see.
- "Is it time?"

1036
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,980
Why do you keep addressing him
as someone older?

1037
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,020
It's been that way
since "Infinite Challenge."

1038
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,600
- That's how I always address him.
- Of course.

1039
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,430
He packs a punch,
is rich, and famous.

1040
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,600
- Yes, he's famous.
- He's an international celebrity.

1041
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,100
- That's right.
- And a legend.

1042
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,530
That makes him our boss.

1043
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,870
- Exactly.
- I get that,

1044
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,030
but I can't treat him
like he's older than me.

1045
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,440
That would be odd.

1046
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,410
- Not you.
- It would seem odd.

1047
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,880
Maybe I should call him
my younger brother.

1048
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,970
- That'd be odd as well.
- Pacquiao wouldn't like it.

1049
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,150
- He's here!
- What?

1050
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,720
My gosh.

1051
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,510
(The siren starts wailing.)

1052
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,220
- My gosh.
- What is it?

1053
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,890
He's here!

1054
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,280
He's here.

1055
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,010
(The elevator slowly
comes to a stop.)

1056
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,220
He's here.

1057
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,480
Goodness.

1058
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,290
(He's finally here!)

1059
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,520
It's Pacquiao.

1060
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,260
(The legendary boxer
appears before them.)

1061
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,670
(Pacquiao is here.)

1062
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,910
(World champion)

1063
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,970
(World champion, Manny Pacquiao)

1064
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,710
(The first boxer to win titles
in eight weight divisions)

1065
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,570
(With his fast and precise punches,
he overpowers his opponents.)

1066
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,640
(The living boxing legend is here.)

1067
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,060
He's here.

1068
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,250
Goodness.

1069
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,680
(The boxing legend enters
while the siren wails.)

1070
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,850
It's Pacquiao.

1071
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,000
(Manny Pacquiao)

1072
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,230
(They've been dying to meet him
since this morning.)

1073
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,060
It's been so long.

1074
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,140
What the...

1075
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,370
It's been so long.

1076
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,930
(He suddenly ripped off
Jae Suk's name tag.)

1077
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,330
What the...
He took off Jae Suk's name tag.

1078
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,250
What? Without a warning?

1079
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,500
What on earth?

1080
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,480
(Their instincts kick in,
and they run.)

1081
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,290
Jae Suk, you're out.

1082
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,640
Hold on a second.

1083
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,810
(That's when something catches
the members' attention.)

1084
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:56,890
I already saw that.

1085
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,560
Don't let him rip your name tag off.

1086
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,930
What the...
He took off Jae Suk's name tag.

1087
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,020
What on earth?

1088
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,100
(Name Tag Elimination)

1089
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,970
(Chuckling)

1090
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,060
Hold on a second.

1091
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,500
Pacquiao, wait.

1092
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,790
Pacquiao, come on.

1093
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,200
No, don't. Please.

1094
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,500
Hold on a second.

1095
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,270
- What's going on?
- What is this?

1096
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,430
Pacquiao, wait.

1097
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,770
Pacquiao.

1098
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,200
- Is this an actual game?
- He's super strong.

1099
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,370
He's really strong.

1100
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,370
- I didn't know.
- Get So Min over there.

1101
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,480
Her.

1102
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,580
(Someone grabs his attention.)

1103
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,720
She's right over there.

1104
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,020
Here he comes.

1105
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,660
She'll be eliminated for sure.

1106
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,810
So Min, keep it casual.

1107
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,560
She's done for.

1108
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,890
(So Min couldn't fight him off.)

1109
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,230
I can't believe it.

1110
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,700
- He's super strong.
- Pacquiao, come on.

1111
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,970
He's really strong.

1112
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,430
Of course he's strong.

1113
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,290
Long time no see.

1114
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,660
- Long time no see. That's right.
- Long time no see.

1115
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,830
Is there a particular order?

1116
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,040
- Is there a hidden rule?
- Is there an order?

1117
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,180
Are we on the list?

1118
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,770
- Got it.
- All right.

1119
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,810
- Name Tag Elimination is now over.
- What?

1120
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,520
He only got three of us though.

1121
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,480
- They must be a team.
- Is that it?

1122
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,520
It was better to have had
your name tag taken off.

1123
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
- Are they on the same team?
- Being eliminated is better.

1124
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,220
What's the meaning of this?

1125
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,060
Long time no see.

1126
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,520
(They officially greet
each other first.)

1127
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,890
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

1128
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,330
Do you remember him?

1129
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,450
Yes, of course.

1130
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,930
- Of course he does.
- Okay.

1131
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,040
We filmed
some crazy episodes together.

1132
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,100
Of course.

1133
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,370
- He's ugly, right?
- Anyway, Pacquiao...

1134
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,200
(He starts to act friendly.)

1135
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,830
Anyway, Pacquiao is the best.

1136
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,540
- He's adorable too.
- I'm a big fan.

1137
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,700
- He's a big fan of yours.
- Right.

1138
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,910
Hi.

1139
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,270
(Ji Hyo finds her opening.)

1140
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,390
- Thank you.
- Oh, my gosh!

1141
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,790
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, my gosh!

1142
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,080
- We shook hands!
- I should run interference.

1143
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,250
- Oh, my gosh!
- I can't believe it.

1144
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,890
We shook hands!

1145
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,000
What's wrong?

1146
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,200
Let me help.

1147
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,250
No!

1148
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,930
Block them.

1149
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,640
My gosh, Pacquiao.

1150
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,430
Raise our guards.

1151
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,430
I'm sorry about this but...

1152
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,870
I'm sorry about this,
but tell him to knock them out.

1153
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,830
Pacquiao, I'm your fan.

1154
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,250
Here we are with Manny Pacquiao.

1155
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,600
The international legend.

1156
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,580
- One, two!
- One, two!

1157
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,850
One, two!

1158
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,790
Can you please greet...

1159
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,390
the many viewers of Running Man?

1160
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,250
Hello, everyone. I'm Manny Pacquiao.

1161
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,100
- "I'm Manny Pacquiao."
- Hello.

1162
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,390
Thank you.

1163
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,790
You're here today on Running Man.

1164
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,060
How does it feel to be here?

1165
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,270
I'm excited.

1166
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,230
"I'm excited."

1167
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,680
Nice to see you again.

1168
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,540
Nice to see you again.

1169
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,480
(The former member of
"Infinite Challenge" keeps quiet.)

1170
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,870
- I don't think he remembers you.
- He doesn't.

1171
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,040
Pacquiao, it's the second time...

1172
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,180
Right.

1173
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,950
Second time?

1174
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,980
He doesn't remember you.
Why did you act like he did?

1175
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,620
- Don't cry, Haha.
- It was like this.

1176
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,750
(The greeting implies
that he's a stranger.)

1177
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,450
- Don't cry, Haha.
- It was like this.

1178
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,270
It was like a politician
greeting potential voters.

1179
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,970
- He doesn't remember you.
- It's upsetting.

1180
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,790
- He said it's upsetting.
- He doesn't remember Haha.

1181
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,560
- It's been a while.
- That's right.

1182
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,810
But you see...

1183
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,310
I don't know how he'll take this,

1184
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,700
but you look more adorable.

1185
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,770
It seems that way.
He seems even friendlier.

1186
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,910
- He looks even better.
- Really?

1187
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,720
(Laughing)

1188
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,850
(High-five)

1189
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,790
I see he likes being called cute.

1190
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,250
- It's a compliment in any culture.
- Exactly.

1191
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,830
(Even the boxing legend
likes being called cute.)

1192
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,560
(Quietly)

1193
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,120
He doesn't know you though.

1194
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,930
- But he must remember me.
- He doesn't know you.

1195
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,160
He doesn't remember you,
so stay put.

1196
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,970
- He doesn't remember you.
- He doesn't.

1197
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,230
- He doesn't.
- Anyway, today...

1198
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,600
Can you tell him that my son...

1199
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,230
- No, don't.
- Don't say that.

1200
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,580
You'll make him uncomfortable.

1201
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,310
His son and mine
went to the same school.

1202
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,870
(Suk Jin wanted to point out
what they had in common.)

1203
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,640
(Excited for his reaction)

1204
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,080
- Yes, really.
- The kids went to the same school.

1205
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,410
He doesn't seem that impressed.

1206
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,620
- He's not fond of it.
- He doesn't seem impressed.

1207
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,450
- Don't mention it again.
- Brent International School.

1208
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,430
- Brent, yes.
- Brent, exactly.

1209
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,450
- My kid too.
- The same?

1210
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,620
Yes, the same.

1211
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,430
- He doesn't seem impressed.
- Exactly.

1212
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,500
He just took it
like another fun fact.

1213
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,790
It's not like
you two went to school together.

1214
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,660
No, that's not the case.

1215
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,040
- Anyway...
- Your son and mine...

1216
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,770
- Stop it.
- Stop. He got it the first time.

1217
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,140
- He understood you.
- Right.

1218
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,330
- When they were young.
- He heard you.

1219
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,700
Also,

1220
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,250
it's been a while
since you visited Korea.

1221
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,350
We're curious as to...

1222
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,480
- what brought you by.
- Exactly.

1223
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,480
(He's here for the special match
that takes place on December 11.)

1224
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,580
He's here to promote
the boxing match.

1225
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,220
- I see.
- Really?

1226
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,520
With DK Yoo, right?

1227
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,730
With a Korean, right?

1228
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,730
I don't know if I should
still call him a boxer...

1229
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,120
or something else...

1230
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,870
because he's now a senator.

1231
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,660
- What should we call him?
- You're a senator.

1232
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,230
My term has ended,

1233
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,000
so I'm back to being
a normal citizen.

1234
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,160
- He's now a normal citizen.
- Is that so?

1235
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,200
- Is he no longer a senator?
- No.

1236
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Then we should address him as that.

1237
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,410
- Mr. Pacquiao?
- Just Mr. Pacquiao.

1238
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,500
No, it's just my buddy Pacquiao.

1239
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,850
- Right, my buddy.
- Exactly.

1240
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,580
- My buddy.
- My buddy Pacquiao.

1241
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,720
- My buddy.
- Manny.

1242
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,770
- Just Manny?
- Manny.

1243
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,310
- Should we call him Manny?
- Yes, that's right.

1244
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,390
- Could you please tell him this?
- Manny!

1245
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,290
I'm older than him,

1246
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,390
but I'd like to address him
as someone older than me.

1247
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,950
Same here.

1248
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,450
I'd like to address him
that way as well.

1249
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,430
My buddy Manny.

1250
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,700
- He's actually older than you.
- He's actually older than you.

1251
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,330
You're younger than him.

1252
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,140
(Chuckling)

1253
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,730
(Chuckling)

1254
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,730
He must be flustered.

1255
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,500
- He's flustered.
- It seems that way.

1256
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,910
- Manny's flustered.
- Yes, we caught him off guard.

1257
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,580
By the way,

1258
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,310
is it true that Manny...

1259
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,750
contacted Running Man first?

1260
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,310
I just couldn't believe
what the staff told us.

1261
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:33,350
- I'd like to confirm it.
- Is he just being polite?

1262
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,290
- The staff's suddenly on edge.
- Exactly.

1263
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,790
The truth will come out.

1264
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,830
- No way.
- Right.

1265
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,230
"Yes, I asked
if I could be on the show."

1266
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,970
Why though?

1267
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,730
I wonder why.

1268
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,600
Because Running Man is a show...

1269
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,040
that my family and children
enjoy watching.

1270
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,640
"Because Running Man is a show..."

1271
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,810
"that my family and children
enjoy watching."

1272
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,220
- Do they know us?
- Thank you.

1273
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,450
- Could they know me?
- Gosh.

1274
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,450
- Manny.
- His family?

1275
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,950
- Do you know who he is?
- "Do you know who he is?"

1276
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,560
(Right...)

1277
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,390
(Right...)

1278
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,770
(It looks like he nodded
because he had no other choice.)

1279
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,200
He was just being polite.

1280
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,560
That was him being polite.

1281
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,060
You know what?
I don't need the translation.

1282
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,140
I understood what he meant.

1283
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,870
"I know who you are,
but not your name."

1284
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,330
- Then...
- The name could be too much.

1285
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,480
- Do you perhaps know me too?
- Come on.

1286
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:29,040
Well...

1287
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,810
- You get it, right?
- I see.

1288
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,350
He knows the show which is enough.

1289
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,620
We don't need him to know our names.

1290
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,950
- He just watches the show.
- Exactly.

1291
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,330
- And Manny's...
- His family must like the show.

1292
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,060
Probably his children.

1293
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,100
- His children love the show.
- Of course.

1294
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,790
- Them laughing is more than enough.
- I agree.

1295
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,020
That's more than enough.

1296
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,160
Now, you will begin
your race with Manny Pacquiao.

1297
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,500
You will be split into two teams
for this race.

1298
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,040
The three that were eliminated
by Mr. Pacquiao earlier...

1299
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,810
- will be on one team.
- My gosh.

1300
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,310
The opposing team
will consist of the other four.

1301
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,810
- Well, this is...
- Right.

1302
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:06,220
Pacquiao doesn't belong
to any of the teams,

1303
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,390
and he'll help carry out the game
as an NPC.

1304
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,890
He won't be joining us?
It's not a 4-on-4 game?

1305
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,290
He'll play for both teams.

1306
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,930
Oh, okay.

1307
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:19,430
We'll keep the fight money
system we had earlier.

1308
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,060
The total amount of money
that the teammates have...

1309
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,230
will be the registration fee
for your team.

1310
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,200
If you win, you'll win an amount
double the registration fee.

1311
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,870
The money will be divided equally
regardless of how much you paid.

1312
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,140
Is that so?

1313
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,980
The losing team will lose
all of the registration fee.

1314
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,580
Then it's better to be
on the same team as Jong Kook.

1315
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,540
So Min has only about 100 dollars.

1316
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,020
- She doesn't have much money.
- I'm low on money.

1317
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,020
She has nothing.

1318
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,580
Please gather again in the studio
after getting changed.

1319
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,250
- All right.
- Let's go!

1320
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,730
Pacquiao!

1321
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,560
What is this?

1322
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,020
They prepared a ring, as expected.

1323
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,730
What kind of game
are we going to play?

1324
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,020
- One.
- One, two.

1325
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,600
One, two, three. You're quite fast.

1326
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,470
- It's tiring.
- You can't just use your hands.

1327
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,810
- You need to shift your weight too.
- How so?

1328
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,160
- What?
- Come. One.

1329
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,330
- You need to shift the weight.
- That hurt.

1330
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,230
- One, two. There you go.
- Two.

1331
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,930
One, two.

1332
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,080
(Not shifting his weight at all)

1333
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,450
Your punches are quite strong.

1334
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,450
I think my punches are quite strong.
I didn't know.

1335
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,080
I keep doing this
because Pacquiao is here.

1336
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,580
Give it a try. Two, three.

1337
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,580
Ready, go.

1338
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,290
You need to hit it fast.
Your strength is speed.

1339
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,450
Isn't she really good?

1340
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,020
- You're good.
- She's pretty fast.

1341
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,160
You're gifted.

1342
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Warm up. Ready, go.

1343
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
All right. That's great.

1344
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,730
- Good job.
- That's great.

1345
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,270
(Punching)

1346
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,390
- Good job.
- She's so fast.

1347
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,600
(The frog boxer
got attacked on her head.)

1348
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,330
How did you hit her
when she's this fast?

1349
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,770
- You're so fast.
- Why does So Min keep doing that...

1350
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,350
when she gets teased all the time?

1351
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,350
She's fast.

1352
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,850
So Min, I can't even see your hands
because they're so fast.

1353
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,410
I'll call you a warrior from now.

1354
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,350
Gosh, I brought my gloves
to get his autograph.

1355
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,410
But I can't seem to find
the right timing.

1356
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,160
(Shy)

1357
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,620
I'll ask for it later.

1358
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,680
So Min, we should take a photo
with Pacquiao later alone.

1359
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,290
- Why?
- To commemorate it.

1360
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,770
Pacquiao is milder than I thought,

1361
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,160
so I was really surprised.

1362
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,770
But when he's on the ring...

1363
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,370
He changes as soon as
he puts on his gloves.

1364
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:09,180
You need to bet your money
as a team.

1365
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,850
- Text me the amount.
- But there are only three of us.

1366
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,910
Do we collect our money
and submit it?

1367
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,450
Let's just pay up.

1368
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,040
- What about...
- Should we pay 50 dollars each?

1369
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,040
That sounded very reasonable.

1370
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,390
That meant you were willing to pay.

1371
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,750
- You can pay 50 dollars, right?
- I'm good with 50 dollars too.

1372
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:22,850
- Me too.
- I'm good with 50 dollars.

1373
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:23,850
(The team with 4 members
agreed to pay 50 dollars each.)

1374
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:24,850
Let's pay 50 dollars each.

1375
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,620
- Are you confident that we'll win?
- That's right.

1376
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,430
That, I'm not sure of.

1377
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,350
We don't know what we'll be playing.

1378
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,620
(They don't know what kind of game
they'll be playing.)

1379
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,830
Let's have her pay just 50 dollars.

1380
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,120
No, we should pay 100 dollars each.

1381
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,200
Okay, I'm in.

1382
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,870
(The team with 3 members
agreed to pay 100 dollars each.)

1383
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,730
Do we pay it now or do we text?

1384
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:41,830
Text us, please.

1385
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,540
(Studying their faces)

1386
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,600
Wait a minute.

1387
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,520
(They figured out
that something was off.)

1388
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,520
Please don't do that.

1389
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,580
Can't we just pay it to you?

1390
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,950
We need to see for it ourselves
that everyone paid.

1391
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,560
We might lose our trust in each other
if we send texts instead.

1392
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,410
- The text...
- First off,

1393
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:58,750
are you sure this is 100 dollars?

1394
00:44:58,930 --> 00:44:59,950
- It is.
- We need to text.

1395
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,100
I'll text instead.
I'll pay 100 dollars.

1396
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,450
Just pay 50 dollars.

1397
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,520
You should pay 50 dollars, at least.

1398
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,370
- Press it, everyone.
- You press it first.

1399
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,500
They can't... Look at them.
They can't trust each other.

1400
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,540
Just press it for now.

1401
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,470
Se Chan.

1402
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,810
(They're all so very serious.)

1403
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,000
What takes so long to pay
100 dollars through text?

1404
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,350
I'm talking with my mom right now.

1405
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,980
Why...

1406
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,450
His sweatsuit looks amazing.

1407
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,350
It's amazing.

1408
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,080
He has a big build.

1409
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,180
(Pacquiao, who got changed,
enters the ring.)

1410
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,220
(He jumps onto the ring.)

1411
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,120
(Pacquiao is getting all the attention
from Trainer Kook.)

1412
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,560
Gosh, Manny Pacquiao is...

1413
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,890
This time, we'll be playing
Relay Speed English Quiz.

1414
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,490
Come on.

1415
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,390
- This is great.
- They're done for.

1416
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,470
This is perfect for Jong Kook.

1417
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,700
- They're done for.
- This is great.

1418
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,660
We paid too much.

1419
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,910
It's a speed quiz,

1420
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,280
but we can't beat them
even if they give us two hours.

1421
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,740
Just like the speed quiz
we've played,

1422
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,180
you'll take turns
to describe the word.

1423
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,640
The last player will guess
what the word is.

1424
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,580
But Pacquiao will be
the first player for both teams.

1425
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,220
You need to explain everything
in English.

1426
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,580
The team that guesses more words
in the given time wins.

1427
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,180
Also, you're not allowed
to use your body.

1428
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,290
You should put your hands
behind you.

1429
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:24,850
- We can't use our bodies?
- This is driving me crazy.

1430
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,890
We can't use our bodies
when we're doing an English quiz?

1431
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,990
But I'm a body language expert.

1432
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,390
- What should we do?
- Then you should've told us.

1433
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,410
We paid way too much.

1434
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:36,970
There are only 3 members
in the 3-person team.

1435
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:39,450
You can choose
one of our staff members...

1436
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,450
and play the game with them.

1437
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,470
We can pick one of you?

1438
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,740
I mean...

1439
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,010
Don't you think Chan Hee
will be good at it?

1440
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,760
- At least he's experienced.
- He has experience.

1441
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,890
Why do you keep staring
at the viewfinder?

1442
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,490
- Why does he keep looking at that?
- I think he's avoiding our eyes.

1443
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:59,830
Don't you think he'll be good at it?

1444
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,790
- No, I don't think so.
- I think he'll be amazing at it.

1445
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,760
- Wait.
- You don't speak English?

1446
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,640
No... Do you speak English?

1447
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,830
"You don't speak English?"

1448
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,240
What did she say?
"You don't speak English?"

1449
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,200
- I don't speak...
- You don't know me?

1450
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,010
- You don't know me?
- Do you...

1451
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,140
She just said
"You don't speak English?"

1452
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,580
And he went...

1453
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,950
(The cameraman refused strongly.)

1454
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,640
That means he can do it.

1455
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,350
It means he can do it.

1456
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,560
Can you speak English?

1457
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,560
Choose one quickly.
Can't we have him to choose for us?

1458
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,350
- Let Manny decide.
- Manny's choice.

1459
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,160
- Manny, make your choice, please.
- Manny's choice.

1460
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,930
Someone who looks like
they'll be good in English.

1461
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,760
(Which staff member will be chosen by him
and join the 3-person team?)

1462
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,100
He's having fun.

1463
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,290
Manny, it's your choice.

1464
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,700
Manny, it's your choice.

1465
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,280
Oh, he picked Seung Hyun.

1466
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,780
(He's done choosing.)

1467
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,240
(Manny picked...)

1468
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,740
- All right.
- Come on!

1469
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,740
- Come on!
- All right.

1470
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,310
- Come on!
- Okay!

1471
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,450
Come on!

1472
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,740
- Yes, come on!
- It's done for.

1473
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,810
- Good choice.
- Good one.

1474
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,660
- Good choice! Yes!
- Sung Ho, come on over.

1475
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,910
Sung Ho went to film abroad
many times.

1476
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,160
He really did.

1477
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,030
When he went abroad for a shoot,

1478
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,350
I saw him being scolded
by an officer at the immigration.

1479
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:06,830
"Sorry!"

1480
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,060
Sung Ho is a changed man.

1481
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,490
Sung Ho is a changed man.

1482
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,600
- Well, then...
- Can you start?

1483
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,700
- Okay, we'll start first.
- Okay.

1484
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,010
All right. We can go first.

1485
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,100
All right.

1486
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,310
- You're the first to go.
- Okay.

1487
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,240
- Thank you.
- Manny.

1488
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:20,870
Sorry.

1489
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,640
Do we put these on?

1490
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,890
- Wait.
- We're in trouble.

1491
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,490
(Singing)

1492
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:29,560
Guess what this song is.

1493
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,530
It's "Attention."

1494
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,620
(Surprisingly,
it's one of the latest songs.)

1495
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,390
I thought it was a traditional song
from the way Suk Jin sang.

1496
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,430
It sounds like a traditional song.

1497
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:43,640
Guess what this song is.

1498
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,240
It's "Attention" by NewJeans.

1499
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,260
(He demands them to guess the song
when he doesn't even listen to it.)

1500
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,740
(Attention)

1501
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,780
(Seok Sam is excited.)

1502
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,600
Suk Jin doesn't even
know that song that well.

1503
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:57,450
But he's just trying to sound young.

1504
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,640
Did you get it?

1505
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,720
Get ready.

1506
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,950
(The mission begins.)

1507
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,160
(They'll describe the given word
in English, starting with Manny.)

1508
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,490
That's too difficult.

1509
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,200
(Refrigerator)

1510
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,200
- That's too difficult.
- What is that?

1511
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,600
I didn't know it was called that.

1512
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,490
What does it say?
Regetor? What is it?

1513
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,930
- Refri...
- Retri...

1514
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,260
(He begins describing it
in English.)

1515
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,760
- It's...
- It's...

1516
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,140
- equipment in the house.
- House?

1517
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,080
- House.
- House?

1518
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,580
Like... You can put something...

1519
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,870
You can put something...

1520
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:34,510
- like food or drinks.
- Food. Drinks.

1521
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,290
Okay, I got it.

1522
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:38,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

1523
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,350
Don't use your hands.

1524
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,490
House.

1525
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,600
Drinks.

1526
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,030
Food.

1527
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,870
House, drinks, food?

1528
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:49,390
House, drinks, food?

1529
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,160
House. It means a house.

1530
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,870
- Yes.
- Water and food?

1531
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,010
- Yes, and you should...
- House, drinks, food? I have...

1532
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,330
- no idea what it means.
- You can't speak in Korean.

1533
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,910
Only English.

1534
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,310
House, drinks, food?
What does it mean?

1535
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,350
Buttons.

1536
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:02,450
- Buttons?
- Buttons.

1537
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,850
(Oh!)

1538
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,410
- Oh, yes. I know.
- Buttons.

1539
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,310
- House, drinks... All right.
- Hurry. Speed up.

1540
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,310
(Will he explain it well to Haha?)

1541
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:14,260
- If you know water... In house...
- In house?

1542
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,720
You put button...

1543
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,600
- "Put button?"
- Water...

1544
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,030
Yes, put it in.

1545
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,430
- Put it in?
- Yes. Water...

1546
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:23,790
(Put button, water, put it in?)

1547
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,830
- Clean water...
- Put water...

1548
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,410
- House, clean, water, machine.
- House, clean, water, machine?

1549
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:30,780
Yes, house, clean, water, machine.

1550
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,140
- But we need to put water in?
- No.

1551
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,970
- He got it wrong.
- Clean, water.

1552
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,140
He must've thought it was
a water dispenser.

1553
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,040
- Isn't that a water dispenser?
- It is.

1554
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,350
Clean, water, house, machine.

1555
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,160
- Clean, water, house, machine.
- Yes.

1556
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:45,510
- I see.
- You don't know?

1557
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,660
Is that Woongjin's?

1558
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,760
Is that Woongjin's?

1559
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,760
- No.
- Good.

1560
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,890
- Is it Woongjin?
- Yes.

1561
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:54,160
Yes!

1562
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,870
He needs to understand it
for him to enjoy this.

1563
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:57,390
- Go.
- Okay.

1564
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,310
Hey, say exactly what I said.

1565
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:00,600
(Suk Jin asked for the delivery of
water dispenser.)

1566
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,700
- A house.
- A house?

1567
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,240
- A house.
- A house.

1568
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,510
- Clean...
- Say it exactly as you heard.

1569
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,280
- water, machine.
- Machine.

1570
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,580
- You mean a water purifier?
- That's right!

1571
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,680
No?

1572
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,220
- It's correct.
- That's not the answer.?

1573
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,220
("Water purifier"
is not the answer.)

1574
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,620
- It's not correct?
- It's a refrigerator.

1575
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,220
I'm so sorry, though.

1576
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,310
Why would you bring water up?

1577
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,490
I also said food!

1578
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,850
- Water...
- Put on your headphones.

1579
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:22,080
We're on standby.

1580
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,620
My gosh. You need to hurry a bit.

1581
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,290
Let's finish this quickly.
You need to listen to the word.

1582
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,470
Gosh, it's supposed to be easy.

1583
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,240
How can you not get that?

1584
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,040
That's not to be put in a fridge.

1585
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,100
Yes?

1586
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,100
It's...

1587
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,680
useful in the house to clean.

1588
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,810
- Yes.
- To clean in the house.

1589
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:42,950
- Like...
- A machine?

1590
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,010
A machine to clean the house.

1591
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:47,450
- Okay.
- Like...

1592
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,160
A machine that cleans the house?

1593
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,890
- Yes.
- Okay.

1594
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,220
Okay. No problem.

1595
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,930
Because you're a legend. No problem.

1596
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,720
- Hurry.
- Yes!

1597
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,530
He's trying to befriend Manny.

1598
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,330
Don't use the scene with them.

1599
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,390
He's trying to follow Manny.

1600
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,490
(Trying to befriend Manny
during a mission)

1601
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:09,910
- A machine that cleans the house?
- Yes.

1602
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,600
Yes, that's it.

1603
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,600
(Vacuum cleaner)

1604
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

1605
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,140
Yes. A house.

1606
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,680
- A house machine.
- A house machine.

1607
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,720
- Clean. For cleaning.
- For cleaning.

1608
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,490
Yes. I'm finished.

1609
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,350
You don't know?

1610
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:27,720
- What?
- Hey.

1611
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,620
- He's the villain of the day.
- He's the villain.

1612
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,620
He's the villain.

1613
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,030
- In the house...
- In the house?

1614
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,390
- A machine.
- A machine.

1615
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,390
To clean?

1616
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,830
Pacquiao, you can't use your hands.

1617
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,560
- To clean.
- To clean.

1618
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,640
Gosh, it's really easy, though.

1619
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,950
(Suk Jin only kept repeating
"a machine for cleaning house.")

1620
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:50,010
(Vacuum cleaner)

1621
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,220
- In house.
- In house.

1622
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,850
- In house.
- Water clean machine?

1623
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,410
- No?
- In house,

1624
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,790
cleaning machine.

1625
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,180
Cleaning machine?

1626
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,530
(In house cleaning machine)

1627
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,330
(Taking a glance)

1628
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:04,330
House cleaning machine?

1629
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:06,100
Stop looking at Manny.

1630
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,200
(Stop looking at Manny.)

1631
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,700
Okay, I'll get this.

1632
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,470
- House.
- House.

1633
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,140
- Cleaning machine.
- Cleaning machine.

1634
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,160
That's it.

1635
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,200
- Wait a minute.
- The end. Finished.

1636
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,330
Haha should try to get it.

1637
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,970
(That's it. The end. Finished.)

1638
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,100
House.

1639
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,140
Cleaning machine.

1640
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,600
- Why would you look at him?
- House.

1641
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,720
(He keeps looking at Manny
as though he wants confirmation.)

1642
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,740
House cleaning machine.

1643
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,620
Hey, it's easy, isn't it?

1644
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,120
House cleaning machine?
House cleaning machine.

1645
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:32,510
Okay!

1646
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,950
(Okay!)

1647
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,160
A washing machine!

1648
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,530
- It's a vacuum cleaner.
- Hey!

1649
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:37,530
(It's wrong.)

1650
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,930
(A house cleaning machine
is a washing machine?)

1651
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:40,030
Come on!

1652
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,970
Hey! I told you
it's a house cleaning machine!

1653
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,290
- Of course it's a vacuum cleaner.
- What's wrong with him?

1654
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,060
- We just need to get one right.
- We just need to get one right.

1655
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,600
- If we get it...
- Sung Ho!

1656
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,040
- Sung Ho, we can do this.
- We just need to get one right.

1657
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,240
- We just need to get one right.
- We just need one.

1658
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,870
- The last one.
- The last one.

1659
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,680
- What's the point?
- You do it.

1660
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,220
- Even if I hear his explanation...
- Just do it.

1661
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,950
- Will you guess the answer?
- I'll do it. We need to get it.

1662
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,510
(Chopsticks)

1663
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,220
(It's the last given word.)

1664
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,120
It's a matter of which team
gets the answer first.

1665
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,060
(Chopsticks)

1666
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,490
You use this to eat.

1667
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:13,620
It's something you use to eat.

1668
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,040
- A plate?
- Korean, Japanese, or Chinese...

1669
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,560
- Chopsticks?
- To...

1670
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,060
(Chuckling)

1671
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,700
Okay.

1672
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,310
- All right.
- Jong Kook can actually talk.

1673
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,470
He really can.

1674
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,200
When you eat ramyeon...

1675
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,310
When you eat ramyeon?

1676
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,350
- Ramyeon.
- Ramyeon. Okay.

1677
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:35,080
- What do you use...
- What do you use...

1678
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,310
- for eating...
- for eating...

1679
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,930
- ramyeon?
- ramyeon?

1680
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,160
- You got it?
- Yes, I got it.

1681
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,200
What is that?

1682
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,100
- Chopsticks?
- Turn around.

1683
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,830
- Okay.
- Go!

1684
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:49,890
(Haha took the hint
and got the answer.)

1685
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:50,930
Say it exactly like how I did.

1686
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,410
Eating ramyeon.

1687
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,410
(Eating ramyeon)

1688
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,410
Eating ramyeon.

1689
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:57,600
- Eating ramyeon?
- Ramyeon?

1690
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,450
Shin Ramyeon, Jin Ramyeon,
Yeol Ramyeon. You know?

1691
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,870
- Yes.
- Ramyeon.

1692
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:03,580
- Yes. Ramyeon? I know ramyeon.
- Yes.

1693
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,870
- Ramyeon.
- Yes. How do you eat it?

1694
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,240
- How do you eat it?
- "How do you eat it?"

1695
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,510
- No forks.
- "How do you eat it?"

1696
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:11,720
(No forks.)

1697
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,990
- No forks.
- That's a good one.

1698
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,720
- No spoons.
- No spoons.

1699
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,060
- That's it!
- Okay.

1700
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,620
That was a good one.

1701
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,620
(If Suk Jin guesses the answer correctly,
they'll win a point.)

1702
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,030
- Eating.
- Eating.

1703
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:22,370
Eating ramyeon.

1704
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:24,040
- Eating ramyeon? Yes.
- Eating ramyeon.

1705
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,240
How ramyeon?

1706
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,200
(How ramyeon?)

1707
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,310
- "How ramyeon?"
- "How ramyeon?"

1708
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:35,950
(An extreme summarization)

1709
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,310
(She omitted so many words
in between.)

1710
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,680
- How do you eat that?
- No.

1711
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,910
(She omitted so many words
in between.)

1712
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,410
- In 1, 2.
- No!

1713
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:44,410
- Eating ramyeon?
- No!

1714
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:45,580
How you eat ramyeon?

1715
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,580
- Four.
- How...

1716
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,060
- No spoons, no forks.
- How you eat ramyeon?

1717
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,530
- Two, one.
- No forks.

1718
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:52,390
Yes! I got it.

1719
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,030
It's...

1720
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,790
- Say it!
- Chipsticks?

1721
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:56,790
(Incorrect)

1722
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,100
You can say it in Korean.

1723
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,100
Chipsticks.

1724
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,200
- It's chopsticks.
- There was a time limit.

1725
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,140
- They're done.
- How...

1726
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,410
- "How ramyeon?"
- "How ramyeon?"

1727
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,200
- "How ramyeon?"
- We were almost there.

1728
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,100
How could you say it's wrong?

1729
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,950
Sung Ho, we can do this much.
It's just one question.

1730
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,970
- It's just one question.
- It's just one question.

1731
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:12,080
- We just need to get one right.
- Let's just answer one.

1732
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,010
- We just need to get one.
- We just need to get one right.

1733
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,080
"How ramyeon?" That was just...

1734
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,080
"Eating ramyeon, how ramyeon?"

1735
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,530
It's even hard to make a joke
like that.

1736
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:21,790
"Eating ramyeon, how ramyeon?"

1737
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,990
"How ramyeon?"

1738
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,430
- Sung Ho, we can do this.
- I'm in trouble.

1739
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,100
- We can do it.
- It's like an old joke.

1740
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,970
We can do this, Sung Ho.
I'll describe it well.

1741
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:29,700
Sung Ho, don't take this too hard.

1742
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,140
It's a matter of wit.
We can do this, So Min!

1743
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,100
Let's go! We can do it!

1744
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,040
- Come on!
- Come on!

1745
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,680
We just need to get one right.

1746
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,140
(Will they be able
to answer one correctly?)

1747
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:43,120
(Mirror)

1748
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,510
(The first hurdle is Se Chan.)

1749
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:46,350
- Okay. Let's go.
- It's easy.

1750
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,180
- When you change dress...
- When you...

1751
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,720
- A dress?
- You...

1752
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,260
- You? "Me?"
- watch in the...

1753
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,790
- "Watch in there?"
- Yourself.

1754
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:56,430
- Yourself.
- Yourself? I do it myself?

1755
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:58,100
(I do it myself?)

1756
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,220
When you change your clothes,

1757
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,870
- you look in the...
- It's all about guts.

1758
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,740
You need to give them a time limit.

1759
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,290
"Yourself?"

1760
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:08,330
- Dressing?
- You watch yourself...

1761
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:10,140
when you
change your clothes like that.

1762
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,970
- You watch yourself.
- He's speaking too fast.

1763
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,910
"Change?" Could you slow down?

1764
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,680
- You're too fast.
- When you get changed...

1765
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,040
(He ended up asking Pacquiao
to slow down.)

1766
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,410
(You're too fast.)

1767
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,010
"Change?" I change?

1768
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,260
And then you watch yourself.

1769
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,810
- Yourself.
- Oh, it's closed?

1770
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,580
Oh, it must be a department store.

1771
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,620
Oh, is it Chanel?

1772
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,720
What do you mean?

1773
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,290
(A pitiful sight)

1774
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,470
Your hair. When you comb your hair.

1775
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,200
- You watch yourself.
- That's enough already.

1776
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,660
- You don't get it?
- Handsome. You...

1777
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,310
You look at yourself,
and you think you're handsome.

1778
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,100
- Dress? Okay.
- I think he got it.

1779
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,330
- Okay?
- Okay.

1780
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,140
- Okay.
- You can't use gestures.

1781
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,200
- Okay.
- We'll be watching.

1782
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,850
- Dress.
- Yes?

1783
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:51,850
- Okay?
- Yes?

1784
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:53,220
- Change.
- A dress change?

1785
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,790
- Then look.
- "Look?"

1786
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:56,850
- "Look."
- Close.

1787
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,080
Dress, change, look, close?

1788
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,330
Go back to the house.

1789
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,260
Go back to the house.

1790
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:05,850
What?

1791
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,560
It's "refund."

1792
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,060
- You get changed.
- You change your dress.

1793
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,700
- You look.
- Look.

1794
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,700
- Change, house?
- Okay.

1795
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,830
Okay, buy.

1796
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,060
- Okay!
- Okay, buy.

1797
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,470
- Yes.
- Close.

1798
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,080
Is this "mirror?"

1799
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,010
Is this "mirror?"

1800
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,620
- Yes!
- Mirror?

1801
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,850
- Mirror?
- Yes! Mirror?

1802
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:27,910
- Mirror?
- Yes!

1803
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:28,990
Mirror?

1804
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:30,720
- No. Mirror?
- Yes.

1805
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:33,010
- Look. Buy.
- It's not "mirror?"

1806
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,580
You look.

1807
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,330
(He misses the answer
when it's right there.)

1808
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,530
Come on.

1809
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,390
- Come on.
- Okay.

1810
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,600
This. Buy.

1811
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,930
- This is fun.
- Okay.

1812
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,100
- Buy. Look.
- Okay.

1813
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,200
- That's enough.
- Manny.

1814
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,700
- Stop it!
- Change.

1815
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,200
That's enough.
It's going on for so long.

1816
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,240
Look.

1817
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,510
(It's time for So Min
to describe it.)

1818
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:54,370
- Dress change.
- Dress change.

1819
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,720
- Look.
- Your hand!

1820
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,040
- Look.
- Watch your hand.

1821
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,720
Look at me.

1822
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,910
"Look at me."

1823
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,910
Dress change. Look.

1824
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:06,080
Oh, you're so beautiful.

1825
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,120
Bye. Then you go home.

1826
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,830
(A mysterious monologue)

1827
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,290
Bye. Then you go home.

1828
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:14,390
(The audience is shocked.)

1829
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:15,560
What was that?

1830
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,640
What is she talking about?

1831
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,600
I got it! Touting on the street?

1832
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,470
No.

1833
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,510
Home. Outside. Go outside.

1834
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,470
- "Go outside?"
- Manny just sighed.

1835
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,450
Why won't my turn come?

1836
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:29,910
Manny must be frustrated.

1837
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,720
Manny must want to punch
a punching bag.

1838
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,120
He's frustrated.

1839
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,740
Okay, go. Sung Ho, go.

1840
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,080
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

1841
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,510
- Sung Ho. Go ahead.
- Dress.

1842
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:40,890
- Dress change.
- You're using your hands.

1843
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:42,580
- Dress change?
- Dress change.

1844
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,220
- Wow.
- What?

1845
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,120
- Wow.
- Your hands.

1846
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,560
Dress change, wow?

1847
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,890
Wow... Bye-bye.

1848
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,970
(It suddenly ends.)

1849
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,700
Dress change,

1850
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,470
wow, bye-bye?

1851
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,310
Dress change, wow, bye-bye.

1852
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,080
We'll give you five seconds.

1853
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,140
- Hold on.
- Five, four,

1854
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,240
- A dresser.
- three,

1855
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,720
No.

1856
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,890
- It's not that? What is it?
- What is it?

1857
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:08,510
- The answer is "mirror."
- It's "mirror."

1858
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,410
- It was "mirror."
- It's not "department store?"

1859
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:13,060
(The answer is "mirror.")

1860
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,930
So Min said the answer.

1861
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:16,930
Se Chan, just follow your guts.

1862
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,220
- Okay. We almost got it.
- Manny!

59:58,699 --> 01:00:00,440
- Please do a good job!
- I got the correct answer.

1863
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:21,100
It was mirror, right?

1864
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,290
(The next question)

1865
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:24,330
A frying pan.

1866
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:27,700
It could be a term
familiar to Koreans.

1867
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,200
You use this in the house.

1868
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,780
You cook.

1869
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:33,370
- Cork?
- You cook.

1870
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:34,600
- Go?
- Cooking.

1871
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,700
- Oh, cooking?
- Cooking. Yes.

1872
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,720
- Oh, "cook?" Got it.
- Yes, cook.

1873
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,810
- You cook eggs.
- Eggs?

1874
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:42,290
- Egg.
- Egg?

1875
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,410
A frying pan?

1876
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,510
(A frying pan?)

1877
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,680
A frying pan?

1878
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,160
(Suddenly glowing)

1879
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,490
(It's as if he found an oasis.)

1880
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:51,850
Look at his face. No, that's not it.

1881
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:54,290
Manny's expression is so cute.

1882
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,100
The expression he has on
when they get the correct answer...

1883
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,240
- is so cute.
- Cook.

1884
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,890
- In the house.
- In the house.

1885
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:00,910
You... It is...

1886
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:02,160
Cooking eggs.

1887
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,510
- Cooking eggs?
- Yes.

1888
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,510
What are they saying?

1889
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,370
What are they saying?

1890
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,510
Cooking eggs?

1891
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,370
Round. It is...

1892
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:14,240
Look at Manny.

1893
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:17,060
I'm sorry, So Min. But don't try to
make a sentence. Just say words.

1894
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,350
Instead of saying in the house,

1895
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:20,060
- just say, house, in, eggs,
- Hey.

1896
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,950
- fries.
- So Min. Look at Manny's face.

1897
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,430
- Chemistry.
- Chemistry?

1898
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,260
- Making.
- Making?

1899
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,330
- Egg.
- Egg.

1900
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:29,560
- Scramble.
- Scramble.

1901
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,970
- Yes. In the house.
- Yes.

1902
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,830
- Scramble in the house.
- Yes.

1903
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,200
- Taesaja in the house.
- In the house.

1904
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,760
In the house.

1905
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,430
Okay.

1906
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,970
- Thank you.
- Switch.

1907
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,350
- Very hot.
- Thank you.

1908
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:42,370
Very hot.

1909
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,510
- In the house.
- In the house.

1910
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:45,850
In the house.

1911
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:47,450
- We just need to get one.
- Egg, cook.

1912
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:48,810
(Egg, cook.)

1913
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,160
(Thinking)

1914
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,850
Egg...

1915
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,490
Start over
from Taesaja in the house.

1916
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:54,830
Taesaja in the house.

1917
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,330
Taesaja in the house.

1918
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,850
Taesaja in the house.

1919
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:00,870
(Surprisingly enough,
he's describing a frying pan.)

1920
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:03,100
- Egg. Scramble.
- Egg.

1921
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,330
- Scramble.
- Cook.

1922
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:05,640
- Cook.
- Cooking.

1923
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,470
(Cameraman Sung Ho focuses
despite his internal conflict.)

1924
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,510
- Jae Suk might get it.
- Go.

1925
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:10,600
I don't know this one.

1926
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,600
- Good.
- I think he'll get it.

1927
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,640
Come on, Sung Ho.

1928
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,740
You have to speak in English.

1929
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,310
Taesaja in the house. Cook.

1930
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:18,910
What?

1931
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:22,450
(Repeating Taesaja)

1932
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:23,660
What?

1933
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,410
- Taesaja?
- Taesaja in the house.

1934
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,260
(Cameraman Sung Ho delivers
what he heard.)

1935
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,720
"Taesaja in the house."

1936
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,990
Taesaja in the house?

1937
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,600
- "Taesaja in the house."
- Taesaja in the house?

1938
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,600
- In the house. Cook.
- Don't look at people in the back.

1939
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,830
Taesaja in the house cook?

1940
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,370
Egg, cook.

1941
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,240
Egg, cook?

1942
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,040
- Taesaja.
- You know what it is.

1943
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,200
- Taesaja in the house?
- You know what it is.

1944
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:49,680
Frying pan.

1945
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:51,450
That's correct.

1946
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,950
- How did you know?
- I told you.

1947
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,680
Egg.

1948
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,010
- Egg.
- Correct.

1949
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,410
Where did Taesaja come from?

1950
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,660
After she said in the house,

1951
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,180
I said Taesaja in the house...

1952
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,620
as a joke.

1953
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,450
Okay. We got it.

1954
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:07,700
Now, I will tell you...

1955
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,830
- each team's registration fee.
- Good job.

1956
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,390
(Announcing the registration fee
each team submitted)

1957
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:13,700
Four-person team.

1958
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,640
- It was 110 dollars.
- What?

1959
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,040
Only 110 dollars for 4 people?

1960
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,200
- My goodness.
- Who paid only 10 dollars?

1961
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,970
Who paid 10 dollars
and who paid nothing?

1962
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,100
- One person didn't pay.
- Right.

1963
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,240
Be honest, who paid 10 dollars
and who paid nothing?

1964
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,680
- I paid 50 dollars.
- Ji Hyo and I paid 50 dollars.

1965
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,390
- I'm innocent.
- I know you didn't pay.

1966
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:29,580
I'm innocent.

1967
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,410
- I'm not paying anymore.
- Me neither.

1968
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:32,890
I'm not paying anymore.
I have lots of money anyway.

1969
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:33,990
Keep that in mind.

1970
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,790
- I'm not paying anymore.
- You lost my trust.

1971
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,060
I'm not paying anymore. Forget it.

1972
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,760
For three-person team...

1973
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,430
- We paid 100 dollars each.
- We paid 100 dollars each.

1974
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:42,560
You paid a total of 210 dollars.

1975
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,240
You only paid 10 dollars? Seriously.

1976
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:47,700
- What's wrong with you?
- You get 140 dollars each.

1977
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,040
I had no money.

1978
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,970
- I thought we were going to lose.
- Hey.

1979
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:52,870
- Go home.
- What is wrong with you?

1980
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,040
You go home.

1981
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,180
I'm not paying anymore.

1982
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,080
I'm locking up my wallet.
I'm not paying anymore.

1983
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,410
- It's closed.
- I'll pay this time.

1984
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,180
Before the game,

1985
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:04,580
text me the amount
within your budget.

1986
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:05,680
- Okay.
- Yes.

1987
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,890
- How much?
- Is this the last mission?

1988
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:07,950
Yes, it's your last mission.

1989
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:09,330
Do you want to pay
for real this time?

1990
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,600
- I'm not paying.
- I'm really paying this time.

1991
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,160
- I'm not paying.
- I'm serious this time.

1992
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:13,430
- Let's pay.
- I'm not paying.

1993
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:14,620
I'll show you.

1994
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,100
- I'm not paying.
- Let's pay 100 dollars each.

1995
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,330
- I'm not paying at all.
- One hundred dollars each.

1996
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,140
- One hundred dollars.
- No, I'm only paying 10 dollars.

1997
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,040
I'm not paying.

1998
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,330
I'll pay 50 dollars.

1999
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:23,430
- Okay. Let's pay 50 dollars each.
- Okay.

2000
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,930
Pay 50 dollars each.

2001
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:26,640
- Okay.
- I'll pay 50 dollars.

2002
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:32,850
Let's pay 50 dollars.
The penalty has nothing to do with money.

2003
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,290
I'll show you
that I paid 50 dollars.

2004
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,120
- Whatever. I don't want to.
- Forget it.

2005
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,390
I don't want to see it.

2006
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:42,850
The penalty...

2007
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:45,350
The penalty won't cost 500 dollars.

2008
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:47,160
- To avoid the penalty.
- Right.

2009
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,160
It'll be over 700 dollars at least.

2010
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,160
So my money is pointless.

2011
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,640
- Let's go all in.
- But...

2012
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,200
- You have to go all in.
- You have to go all in.

2013
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,510
- I'll go all in.
- Even if you keep it, you'll lose.

2014
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,200
But even in the individual round...
Right, I lose.

2015
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,870
- You lose. You must go all in.
- You lose. You must go all in.

2016
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:01,950
I'll go all in.

2017
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:03,810
(Sent)

2018
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:04,970
Done.

2019
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,910
- Did you send it?
- Yes. I really sent it.

2020
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:09,740
- This is the last mission anyway.
- Did you all send the amount?

2021
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,510
- Yes.
- Yes.

2022
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:13,580
- You may warm up.
- Warm up?

2023
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,680
We got up early today.
We're all warmed up.

2024
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,220
Come on.

2025
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,950
(The cheeky boxer makes a fuss
while warming up.)

2026
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,700
- One, two.
- Good.

2027
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:22,200
- One, two.
- Good.

2028
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,600
(They show off what they saw.)

2029
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,740
So Min. You're good.

2030
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,660
(The town boxer gets ready
for the match with Pacquiao.)

2031
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,310
- You little...
- Oh, I know.

2032
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,600
(The legend boxer gets ready
to greet the town boxer.)

2033
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,370
One, two. Let's go.

2034
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,620
One, two. Good.

2035
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:40,490
(Suk Jin approaches Pacquiao
while everyone is warming up.)

2036
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:43,310
Manny. Do you know Alabang?

2037
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:44,850
- Alabang.
- Yes.

2038
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,080
- Do you know Alabang?
- Yes.

2039
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,260
A city in the Philippines.

2040
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,390
My wife and my son...

2041
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:52,290
- In Alabang?
- Two years...

2042
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:53,990
- Lived there.
- In Alabang?

2043
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,200
In Alabang.

2044
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:58,390
Suk Jin keeps bothering Manny
in the back.

2045
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,830
He keeps talking about
his personal stuff.

2046
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:03,970
He'll later ask him
to follow each other.

2047
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:05,580
Don't do that.

2048
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:08,810
- Don't bother him.
- This mission...

2049
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,740
is a chance to spar
with the best boxer in the world.

2050
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:15,310
It's One Punch Three Points.

2051
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:16,910
- One Punch?
- One Punch Three Points.

2052
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,290
Everyone will wear a t-shirt
with scores on it...

2053
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:23,290
- and color gloves.
- Okay.

2054
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:25,390
If you punch the number on
Pacquiao's t-shirt,

2055
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,470
it becomes your point.

2056
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,700
If Pacquiao hits your number,

2057
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,740
- you lose points.
- This is going to be hard.

2058
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,310
We'll combine the points
you earned within the limited time.

2059
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:39,970
The team that earned more points
wins.

2060
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,370
Okay.

2061
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:44,470
At least three people will be down.

2062
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,470
Now my right arm can
finally breathe.

2063
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:49,290
Please go put on the target t-shirt.

2064
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:51,010
- Let's play at once.
- I'll get to...

2065
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,060
Okay.

2066
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,720
That's taekwondo gear.

2067
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,830
- I'll show you.
- Show me what? Pull it down.

2068
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:56,930
Speed.

2069
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:58,930
What speed?

2070
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,870
I never tried boxing before.
This is my first time.

2071
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:04,140
Manny's warming up.

2072
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,430
I'll copy him.

2073
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:09,060
Do we put on the head gear?

2074
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,740
If you want.

2075
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:12,970
It's up to you.

2076
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,180
Give me the head gear please.

2077
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,140
I'll put on the head gear.

2078
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,970
- We...
- Just in case.

2079
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:20,720
- Point.
- Good.

2080
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,490
Point.

2081
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,680
- Jong Kook.
- Point.

2082
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,890
- Jong Kook.
- Point.

2083
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,330
Finally, they're sparring.

2084
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:29,620
Point.

2085
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,390
Point.

2086
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:32,700
He's having fun.

2087
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,060
Jong Kook is happy.

2088
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,370
- Point.
- Jong Kook...

2089
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:37,870
I've never seen Jong Kook
doing that before.

2090
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:39,100
Are you honored?

2091
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,310
He's honored.

2092
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:43,160
It's an honor even if Manny
punches you in the face.

2093
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:44,740
- I'll still be honored.
- So Min.

2094
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,510
You need to make a fuss here
when you're boxing.

2095
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:51,040
Right. People do that.

2096
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,120
(Too much warm up for what they got)

2097
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,640
We invited Director Bae Sung Oh...

2098
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,560
of Boxing Association of Korea
for fair judgment.

2099
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

2100
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,390
Thank you for coming.

2101
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:07,790
What are you doing?

2102
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,700
Because he's here.

2103
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,540
I'm Bae Sung Oh
from Boxing Association of Korea.

2104
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,660
- Nice to meet you.
- Judge Bae.

2105
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,200
Director Bae looks like...

2106
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,330
- one of us.
- I know.

2107
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:21,010
That's Jae Suk's old hairstyle.

2108
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,740
He reminds me of Jae Suk
in the past.

2109
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:25,080
He looks like a mix
of Jong Shin and Jae Suk.

2110
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,910
The game is going to start.

2111
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:29,010
You seem very nervous.

2112
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,240
Yes. I'm very nervous.

2113
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,410
(Confessing)

2114
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:32,620
Shall we start?

2115
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,490
- Now...
- So Min.

2116
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:36,530
So Min and Se Chan will start first.

2117
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,720
- I feel dizzy already.
- So Min.

2118
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,050
- You go first.
- You two go first.

2119
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:42,560
Hey. You should go first.

2120
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,740
- You think I can do it?
- Go for it.

2121
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:48,060
(Pacquiao versus Se Chan and So Min)

2122
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,380
I'm finally released
after a long time.

2123
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,340
- I'm already running out of breath.
- A sparring with Manny...

2124
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,600
- is an honor.
- Okay.

2125
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,010
- It's an honor.
- Okay.

2126
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,210
- We should be...
- Fair play.

2127
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,420
- Fair play.
- honored.

2128
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,880
I'm so nervous.
Please go easy on me.

2129
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:07,630
So smooth.

2130
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,890
- Okay.
- Box.

2131
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,550
Hey.

2132
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,390
It's hard for Manny to deal
with two people at the same time.

2133
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,870
- Right. It's not easy.
- Hey.

2134
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,260
- Running away won't help.
- Manny.

2135
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,870
Running away won't help.

2136
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,600
Manny is very fast.

2137
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,130
- His feet are very fast.
- He can move very fast.

2138
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:27,170
When one person goes in,
the other must go in too.

2139
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,550
When one person goes in,
the other must go in too.

2140
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:32,880
He's fast just as I heard.

2141
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,050
(A sudden right jab)

2142
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:41,420
He's so fast.

2143
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,330
- He's fast.
- You must go in.

2144
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:46,330
- So Min. You need to go in.
- Go in.

2145
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:48,300
- Go in.
- So Min. Go in.

2146
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:50,870
So Min.

2147
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,800
So Min.

2148
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:56,210
- What's she doing?
- Are you bowing?

2149
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,240
Manny's flustered.

2150
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,580
Go in.

2151
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:01,840
- It's not easy for Manny either.
- Manny.

2152
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,580
- Keep jabbing.
- Manny's struggling.

2153
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,920
Manny's struggling too.

2154
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,470
It's hard for Manny
to hit the number.

2155
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:08,490
Oh, I got it.

2156
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,550
Oh, I got it.

2157
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:12,960
(The protruding mouth boxer's
counterpunch)

2158
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:15,750
That's three points.

2159
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,790
(Boxer Yang earned 3 points.)

2160
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,700
- Where?
- On top.

2161
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,830
- That's ten points.
- Ten points.

2162
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,000
Hey.

2163
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:26,000
He got hit in the stomach.

2164
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,600
- Hey.
- So Min. Go in.

2165
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,670
Stretch.

2166
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:31,970
So Min. You must go in.

2167
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,410
- Go in.
- Go in.

2168
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:35,280
So Min. Go.

2169
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,410
- You must go in together.
- Go in.

2170
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,880
(Lethargic)

2171
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,450
Watch out for low-blow!

2172
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,810
- So Min. You must go in.
- Ten points.

2173
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:43,450
That's over ten points.

2174
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,310
Go for ten points.

2175
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:46,810
Go in.

2176
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:48,630
Go for ten points.

2177
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:50,380
(He pretends to look at Se Chan
then hits 10 on So Min's shirt.)

2178
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,050
He got your ten.

2179
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:54,220
- So Min.
- So Min.

2180
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,260
What are you doing?

2181
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,240
Go in. Stretch your arm.

2182
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:59,590
Go in. Stretch your arm.

2183
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,800
That was great, So Min.

2184
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,300
(She goes in slowly
and stretches her arm.)

2185
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,780
(Manny quickly touches 3 points.)

2186
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,340
(Touching 3 points again)

2187
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:09,340
- He's fast.
- Manny is accurate.

2188
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,640
- That's right.
- Manny's having fun.

2189
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,710
Come here.

2190
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:12,810
- Manny is laughing.
- Come here.

2191
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,840
Manny is having fun.

2192
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,310
(Manny decides to play along.)

2193
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:17,550
Manny's flustered.

2194
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:19,350
- Manny got a lot of paint on him.
- So Min.

2195
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,380
- He's playing along.
- He's got a lot of paint.

2196
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,830
- He's in a mess.
- He got a lot of paint.

2197
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:24,890
- Let's go in at the count of three.
- Okay.

2198
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:26,590
One, two, three, go.

2199
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:27,630
(Laughing)

2200
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:28,630
So Min. Get up.

2201
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:29,700
(Laughing)

2202
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,800
I'm exhausted.

2203
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,760
It's not easy for Manny to deal
with two people at the same time.

2204
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,100
My arm couldn't reach him.

2205
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,630
Are you tired?

2206
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,500
- Manny.
- Manny's tired.

2207
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:44,510
(Children are begging him
to play with them for more.)

2208
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:45,750
- Corner him.
- Hurry up.

2209
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,120
(Laughing)

2210
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,140
(Play with us, Uncle Manny.)

2211
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,420
- Hey.
- Come here.

2212
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,460
Do you know how expensive Manny is?

2213
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:53,790
(The game ends.)

2214
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:55,250
- Okay.
- Stand up.

2215
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,590
- I can't play anymore.
- Manny got hit a lot too.

2216
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,700
He got hit a lot.

2217
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,890
- He needs to get changed.
- Manny is...

2218
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:04,200
- I got hit a lot.
- We're calculating the score.

2219
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,390
- I'm out of breath.
- I'm so tired.

2220
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:07,670
You should've been
more enthusiastic.

2221
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:10,460
Mark yourself
and punch from down here.

2222
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,740
Why would you sit down?

2223
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:16,450
- You need to go in there and fight.
- I'll watch your play.

2224
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:17,970
- Punch right here.
- Okay.

2225
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,970
- Who's playing this time?
- You.

2226
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,310
- Your team.
- Us?

2227
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,590
- Who's playing?
- Ji Hyo and who?

2228
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:24,710
- Ji Hyo and...
- Ji Hyo and...

2229
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:26,050
Me?

2230
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,250
- Suk Jin?
- Okay.

2231
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,590
It's going to be fun.

2232
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,160
Ji Hyo will be a tough contender.

2233
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,200
Can you translate?

2234
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,700
Ask him if I can go rough.

2235
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:37,260
- If you can go rough on him?
- Yes.

2236
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:40,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

2237
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,710
- Yes.
- Yes.

2238
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:44,800
- His eyes changed.
- Tell him he's Honey Punch.

2239
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,710
(Honey Punch is embarrassed
for acting up.)

2240
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:48,080
- "Honey Punch."
- "Honey Punch."

2241
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,500
"Honey Punch."

2242
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:51,970
Honey Punch. This is only a game.

2243
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:53,580
- Honey Punch.
- Yes, Honey Punch.

2244
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:54,990
Let's begin.

2245
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:57,310
Box.

2246
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:59,380
Good. That was so fast.
I couldn't see you.

2247
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,130
(Honey Punch dashes from the start.)

2248
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,160
- Suk Jin is over.
- Suk Jin is over.

2249
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,460
- He's tired.
- He's over soon.

2250
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,700
(Wasting his energy for nothing)

2251
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:13,800
(Right in 10 points)

2252
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,130
(He got punched
while making a fuss.)

2253
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,910
Manny.

2254
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:22,450
(At that moment, the old boxer
proves his still strong.)

2255
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:23,710
- Manny.
- He hit Manny for real.

2256
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:25,250
Get over here.

2257
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:27,290
Manny is getting upset.

2258
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:28,310
(Suk Jin goes at him obstinately.)

2259
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:29,790
He's happy.

2260
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,620
(However, Manny avoids
all his punches.)

2261
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,010
But he's so...

2262
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:35,830
- Suk Jin. You'll pass out.
- It's over.

2263
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:38,090
Punching obstinately consumes
so much energy.

2264
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,920
- He's out of energy.
- That consumes lots of energy.

2265
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,800
- Punch him now.
- Now is the time.

2266
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:44,090
- Punch him now.
- Now is the time.

2267
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:45,430
- Go.
- Punch him now.

2268
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:46,430
Manny, now.

2269
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:48,430
Punch him hard.

2270
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:49,910
(Punching Suk Jin
in groggy condition)

2271
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:51,240
(However, Player Ji makes effort.)

2272
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,170
- Suk Jin still hit him.
- He dropped it.

2273
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,670
(Manny's glove is off.)

2274
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:58,420
- His glove is off.
- Sorry.

2275
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,340
(Apologizing quickly)

2276
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:02,550
- Sorry.
- He apologizes right away.

2277
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,920
He's afraid of losing a friend.

2278
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,160
Before he loses a follower.

2279
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,710
He's worried
about losing a follower.

2280
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,130
- Sorry.
- Box.

2281
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:10,220
- Manny's angry.
- Ji Hyo. Get closer.

2282
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,330
(He pretends to look at Suk Jin
then hits 10 points on Ji Hyo.)

2283
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:15,420
He's so fast.

2284
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,670
- That scared me.
- Ji Hyo. You need to go in.

2285
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:19,700
He hit her.

2286
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,800
(Two players attack Manny together.)

2287
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,560
He blocked them.

2288
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,040
Sorry.

2289
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,140
- Sorry.
- Why does he keep saying sorry?

2290
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,550
In case he gets punched.

2291
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,510
- He's getting punched more.
- He might get punched later.

2292
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:33,950
Here.

2293
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:35,620
It's over.

2294
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:38,180
- Okay.
- Suk Jin gave his all.

2295
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:42,330
I'm your legend.

2296
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,250
I mean, you're my legend.

2297
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:47,220
"I'm your legend?"

2298
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,700
- He said, "I'm your legend."
- "I'm your legend."

2299
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,960
You're my legend.

2300
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:52,630
It's not even "You're my hero,"
but "You're my legend."

2301
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:53,960
It's my turn now.

2302
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,130
You need to take your glasses off.
Give it to me.

2303
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:57,130
I have to.

2304
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:58,210
Go.

2305
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,430
Jae Suk.

2306
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:00,630
(Off the grasshopper goes.)

2307
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,550
You got it.

2308
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,120
Here goes Baby Punch.

2309
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,710
Baby Punch.

2310
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,010
Honey Punch.

2311
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,620
- Baby Punch.
- Baby Punch.

2312
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,310
I have the baby's punch.

2313
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:12,680
The punch that never harmed
anyone before.

2314
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,350
- Box.
- He got punched.

2315
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:18,720
- He got punched in the face.
- Baby Punch.

2316
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:20,550
He's acting up.

2317
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:22,060
I wish he gets punched.

2318
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,500
- That's right.
- He's acting up.

2319
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,130
- He's acting up.
- Manny doesn't like that.

2320
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,340
- He's acting up.
- Manny doesn't like that.

2321
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,430
(Hitting 3 points unexpectedly
while acting up)

2322
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:31,970
He can't see without his glasses.

2323
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,540
- Nothing can stop him.
- Nothing can stop him.

2324
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,550
- Punch.
- Hey.

2325
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,550
- Nothing can stop him.
- Nothing can stop him.

2326
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,640
(A long distance attack)

2327
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,670
- Hey.
- Sorry.

2328
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,590
Hey. Apologize now.

2329
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,840
Sorry, Manny.

2330
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,050
Manny is angry.

2331
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,290
Okay.

2332
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:49,180
(Manny's body blow)

2333
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,220
Punch him.

2334
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,350
Punch him hard.

2335
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,750
Punch.

2336
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,530
Manny. Strong punch please.

2337
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:57,060
Random punches are harder
to deal with.

2338
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,260
- Strong.
- His punches are so random.

2339
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,930
- Look at Manny's face.
- Jae Suk is so scared.

2340
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,130
- Jae Suk. Give up.
- You can see in his face.

2341
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,000
Come on, Manny.

2342
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,380
- One, two.
- Go, Manny.

2343
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,380
- The look on his face changed.
- Manny.

2344
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,380
- The look on Manny's face changed.
- He seems upset.

2345
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:16,090
- He's angry.
- He's angry.

2346
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:18,750
Manny's angry.
He's keeping his guard up.

2347
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,250
Your stomach...

2348
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,220
(Hitting 10 points)

2349
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,660
His punches are getting stronger.

2350
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,870
(Hitting 3 points next)

2351
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:29,260
Punch him hard please.

2352
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:30,390
(Beating)

2353
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:34,370
I hate seeing Jae Suk trying hard.

2354
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:37,500
One, two.

2355
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:39,930
- You learned it.
- One, two.

2356
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,210
(Manny corners Jae Suk again.)

2357
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:45,780
(Hitting 10 points again)

2358
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:46,970
That was fast.

2359
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:48,340
(Player Yoo only acts up, no fruit.)

2360
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,090
Punch him hard.

2361
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:53,090
If this was a real game,
you're dead already.

2362
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:56,050
- One, two.
- Go, Jae Suk

2363
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:59,250
- Look at that.
- The windmill.

2364
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,170
That's right. Use the windmill.

2365
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:02,330
The windmill.

2366
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:03,890
(Swoosh)

2367
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:06,060
(Laughing)

2368
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,930
(Jae Suk couldn't
hit Manny at all.)

2369
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,170
Jae Suk is exhausted.

2370
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:12,780
Okay.

2371
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,250
Okay.

2372
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,410
(The game ended
after Jae Suk acting up.)

2373
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:16,780
- Nice.
- Yes.

2374
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,050
Jae Suk. Your shirt is a mess.

2375
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:23,250
- I got punched so much.
- You got punched so much.

2376
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:24,490
- You got beat up.
- It's so hard.

2377
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:28,250
The players from four-person team
will play a minute each.

2378
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,720
If we're tired, we'll switch.

2379
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:31,830
I'll play only for 30 seconds.

2380
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,420
I'll switch when I'm tired.

2381
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:38,130
- This is the last game.
- Go, Manny.

2382
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:39,300
He got punched.

2383
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,060
- Manny.
- He's so strong now.

2384
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:43,240
Manny, please. Big punches.

2385
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,500
(The cheeky boxer upsets Manny.)

2386
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,410
(He starts venting his anger
on Haha.)

2387
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:51,420
(Body blow right in the spot)

2388
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,970
That was strong.

2389
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,090
- Switch.
- Switch.

2390
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:57,550
That's strong.

2391
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:59,310
(He asks to switch
after getting beat up.)

2392
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:00,420
Switch.

2393
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,490
That's strong.

2394
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:02,550
Okay.

2395
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:03,790
(He's coming.)

2396
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:05,420
Okay.

2397
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,030
- Okay.
- They switched.

2398
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,300
I can't wait.

2399
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,800
- Okay.
- Manny.

2400
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,240
(Finally, the big match begins.)

2401
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:18,380
(He's been training his fists sharp
for today.)

2402
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:21,950
(He built his body
with realistic training.)

2403
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:25,640
(Finally, it's time to show.)

2404
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,090
- Manny.
- Okay.

2405
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:29,750
- Manny.
- Okay.

2406
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,050
- Okay.
- Manny.

2407
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,350
Okay.

2408
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,490
- Okay.
- Don't forget to take steps.

2409
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:35,990
- Don't forget to take steps.
- Okay.

2410
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:37,290
(Unexpected right jab)

2411
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,330
Manny, please.

2412
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:42,700
- I want you to win.
- He's a villain.

2413
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:45,430
He's a villain.

2414
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:47,560
(Hitting 3 points)

2415
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,560
He's fast.

2416
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:50,560
(Tense)

2417
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,630
He's fast.

2418
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:54,170
I want him to hit Jong Kook's jaw
and knock him out.

2419
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:55,880
For two seconds, right?

2420
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,810
- Knock him out for a second.
- Manny.

2421
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:02,310
Manny's taking steps.

2422
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:04,510
- Manny's taking steps.
- Manny.

2423
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:05,620
He's fast.

2424
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,250
There he is.

2425
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:10,550
(It feels like
something big's coming.)

2426
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,960
(Manny corners Jong Kook.)

2427
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,060
- Harder.
- Manny.

2428
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:17,960
Give them ten more minutes.

2429
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:22,100
- Manny.
- Manny.

2430
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,630
(The two carefully aim for the gap.)

2431
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,050
(Even a light touch is fatal.)

2432
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:29,100
Go.

2433
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,380
(Finally, Manny hits Jong Kook.)

2434
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,990
(Jong Kook turns into Rudolph.)

2435
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:41,090
(Pink princess)

2436
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:42,660
His face.

2437
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,550
He got punched here.

2438
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:46,030
He got punched right here.

2439
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,500
- Okay.
- He got punched here.

2440
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,500
(Everyone is happy
except for Jong Kook.)

2441
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,630
That's hilarious.

2442
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,000
- He hit me in the face.
- Okay, Manny.

2443
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,460
- He hit me in the face.
- Give up.

2444
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:56,130
- Jong Kook.
- He hit my face.

2445
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,880
- He's not allowed to hit the face.
- That was hilarious.

2446
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,130
I'm jealous.

2447
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:01,100
(It started as a big boxing match
and ended as comedy.)

2448
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,170
Jong Kook was so annoying.

2449
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,250
He punched Jong Kook
right in the face.

2450
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:06,250
- He couldn't help it.
- It was his instinct.

2451
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,250
Manny.

2452
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,550
I can't believe...

2453
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:10,140
I got to see Jong Kook
getting punched.

2454
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,160
- Me too.
- Manny hit me right in the face.

2455
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:13,680
My goodness.

2456
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:14,960
Good job.

2457
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:17,180
- It was his instinct.
- Thank you so much.

2458
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,830
Thank you.

2459
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:23,090
Three-person team paid...

2460
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,000
four hundred and fifty dollars
for the registration fee.

2461
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:27,430
Really?

2462
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:30,000
And four-person team...

2463
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,080
paid 30 dollars.

2464
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,210
(Only 30 dollars)

2465
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,170
- Hey.
- They locked up their wallets.

2466
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:37,410
Hey. I'm the only one who paid?

2467
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,280
- This is terrible.
- You paid 30 dollars?

2468
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:40,950
- Really?
- I paid 30.

2469
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:41,990
I paid 20 dollars.

2470
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:43,990
Don't be ridiculous.
I paid 30 dollars.

2471
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:46,550
- Haha.
- I can't believe it.

2472
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,790
- I'll now reveal the score.
- Yes.

2473
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:53,090
Four-person team got
minus 78 points.

2474
01:20:58,430 --> 01:20:59,600
Three-person team...

2475
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,630
(The score of the 3-person team)

2476
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,860
is minus 105 points.

2477
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:05,640
What are you talking about?

2478
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:07,560
Who lost all the points?

2479
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,510
- Who lost more than 100 points?
- Did we lose that many points?

2480
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:10,900
Did you...

2481
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,030
I didn't lose 100 points.

2482
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:13,270
But he's still alive.

2483
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:17,810
(Player Yoo just acted frivolously
without winning any points.)

2484
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:22,020
(But Manny kept scoring
with his punches.)

2485
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,050
(Jae Suk kept getting punched.)

2486
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:26,810
I will announce the final results.

2487
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:27,810
(Announcing the final results)

2488
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:29,230
Kim Jong Kook has...

2489
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:30,930
Total of 1,265 dollars.

2490
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:31,930
Jong Kook has a lot.

2491
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,930
Me? Right. I received
a lot of money at the beginning.

2492
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:37,670
And Ji Hyo has 615 dollars.

2493
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:40,770
Suk Jin has 585 dollars.

2494
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:43,340
Haha has 515 dollars.

2495
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:44,340
Haha.

2496
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,480
Jae Suk has 520 dollars.

2497
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,640
- Is it 520 dollars?
- Yes.

2498
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,680
Se Chan has 300 dollars.

2499
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:52,980
And So Min has 30 dollars.

2500
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:55,180
- We should've won.
- We should've won this game.

2501
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,350
Okay.

2502
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,180
How much is the exemption card?

2503
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,650
- Only 30 dollars?
- Make it 30 dollars.

2504
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:02,430
What's with her?

2505
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,480
- Why did you do that at first?
- What's the reason?

2506
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,430
Why do you always end up like that?

2507
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:08,820
Just tell me how to win.

2508
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:12,390
- I will reveal today's prize first.
- Yes.

2509
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:13,640
Honey.

2510
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:14,970
(The gourmet honey set
that will strengthen your immunity)

2511
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:16,640
- That's honey.
- If I win the prize,

2512
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,060
I'll give it to Pacquiao.

2513
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:19,680
- What?
- Honey.

2514
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:22,440
About the penalty exemption card.

2515
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,270
Both the exemption card
and the prize are...

2516
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,640
- Six hundred dollars each.
- Seriously...

2517
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,420
(It's more expensive
than what they expected.)

2518
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,640
- How much?
- It's 600 dollars.

2519
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,640
- We can't buy it.
- Then...

2520
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,110
No, Jong Kook can buy it.

2521
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,560
Right.

2522
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,180
- How much do you have?
- How much do I have?

2523
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,390
How much do I have?

2524
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:40,460
I want to get one
and give it to Manny.

2525
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,270
Okay. So you buy one prize
and one exemption card.

2526
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:44,390
- All right.
- Okay.

2527
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:45,770
- You buy one.
- But the exemption card.

2528
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:46,890
Can you give me ten dollars?

2529
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:48,030
- I'll give you ten dollars.
- All right then.

2530
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:50,560
Except for those two,
the rest will get the penalty.

2531
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,840
- Jong Kook, you're amazing.
- But you know what?

2532
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:54,810
Those who get the penalty today...

2533
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:57,070
are the ones who came
to the spot for 1,000 dollars.

2534
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,980
(They ruined it from the beginning.)

2535
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:01,240
- That's true.
- You're right.

2536
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:04,280
Can I borrow 90 dollars from Manny?

2537
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:05,610
My gosh.

2538
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:06,680
(It must be an unfamiliar request
for the world star.)

2539
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:07,780
He hesitates.

2540
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,980
Please give Manny Pacquiao
a big hand.

2541
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,820
Thank you so much.

2542
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:15,190
- Right.
- We really mean it.

2543
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:17,470
- Thank you so much.
- We all were honored...

2544
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:19,560
to meet him here today.

2545
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:23,530
Please tell him that I'm grateful
for the counter punch.

2546
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:26,810
I was really honored.

2547
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:28,380
Please say goodbye to our viewers.

2548
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,900
Thank you very much
for this opportunity.

2549
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,770
It's fun.

2550
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:35,890
The games and everything.

2551
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:38,280
Thank you for the opportunity...

2552
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,350
where we played together
in this show...

2553
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:42,280
and for inviting me to the show.

2554
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,060
I hope that this is not the last.

2555
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,520
Please tell him...

2556
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,190
we will see him again
when we go to the Philippines.

2557
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,130
- Okay.
- All right.

2558
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:52,130
(They promised to meet again
in the Philippines.)

2559
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,140
And...

2560
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,060
You can tell him anytime.

2561
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,510
- Can we really go?
- All right then.

2562
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:58,470
- We can really go.
- We will have a concert.

2563
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,270
Oh, okay. You can come.

2564
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:01,980
- He regrets saying that.
- Don't put pressure on him.

2565
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,070
He says he will
take care of everything.

2566
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:07,050
No, I don't want
to put pressure on him.

2567
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,440
What do you mean?

2568
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,550
It's okay.

2569
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,280
- He says it's okay. You can come.
- Really?

2570
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,680
- Thank you.
- He will be honored.

2571
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,090
I brought a glove.
Can I get your autograph?

2572
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,180
Why are you saying that?

2573
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:17,560
I should get his autograph.

2574
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:18,780
(That's how they say goodbye
to Manny Pacquiao with love.)

2575
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:19,930
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2576
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,350
Thank you.

2577
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:25,130
The five of you will stay
and receive the penalty now.

2578
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:26,890
- The rest may leave now.
- Okay.

2579
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:28,970
Today's penalty is...

2580
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:31,810
known to be the training method
for the best boxers.

2581
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,430
It's woodchopping.

2582
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:36,270
You will chop firewood
before going home.

2583
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:38,270
- Chop firewood? I can do that.
- That's simple.

2584
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:39,350
Can I start now?

2585
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,310
This is difficult.

2586
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:43,980
Gosh, it's not split.

2587
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,720
- This is hard.
- So Min can't do this.

2588
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,980
It's not split.

2589
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:50,090
I'm going home now.

2590
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:52,020
- I'm going home!
- My gosh.

2591
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,990
All right.

2592
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:57,270
Okay.

2593
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:58,320
Me too.

2594
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:00,470
(Seok Sam enjoys his green old age.)

2595
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,490
Go home.

2596
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:02,970
All right.

2597
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:04,360
- You should use your weight.
- So Bal.

2598
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,470
Here, So Min.

2599
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:07,230
- Gosh.
- It's ready.

2600
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:08,570
It will be amazing
if she manages to do this.

2601
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,180
Be careful.

2602
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:11,900
This is not working.

2603
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,920
Be careful.

2604
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,920
(She tries her best.)

2605
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,140
You shouldn't be afraid.

2606
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,420
- But I'm scared.
- Just hit it.

2607
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:19,180
- Hit it.
- I'm scared.

2608
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:22,590
I'll split it this time.
Wait a little more. I'll do it.

2609
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:24,090
- All right.
- Are you knocking?

2610
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:26,130
- I'm almost there.
- Are you knocking?

2611
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,650
- All right.
- You shouldn't make cuts like that.

2612
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:29,670
Jae Suk.

2613
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:31,100
This will take a while.

2614
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,890
So Min, I should go on ahead.

2615
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:34,970
- Hang on a second, Haha.
- So Min, can we leave first?

2616
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:35,970
(They are trying to run away.)

2617
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:38,860
- This is not working.
- So Min, we should go on ahead.

2618
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,810
- If you put it in there, it's over.
- Right.

2619
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:42,570
(Once she hits it right,
it will be over.)

2620
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,640
- Watch your hands.
- Watch your feet.

2621
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,980
- Gosh.
- We should go.

2622
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,850
- I should go home.
- I can't wait.

2623
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:50,810
This will take a long time.

2624
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:52,810
- I have to go.
- Help me leave.

2625
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:54,720
I have to go now.

2626
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,480
- See you.
- Don't drop it...

2627
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,460
- Don't drop it like this.
- Bye.

2628
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:00,300
- You're almost there.
- Jae Suk is...

2629
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,760
- It's done.
- Yes.

2630
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:05,360
(She finally did it.)

2631
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,860
- Is it done?
- Goodbye.

2632
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:08,560
So Min, we're here.

2633
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,430
- I waited until the end.
- Me too.

2634
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:12,400
- All right.
- We're family.

2635
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,980
- Thank you for today.
- We were here for you.

2636
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:15,980
(Seok Sam waits for her to finish.)

2637
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:19,480
At eight every morning,

2638
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,610
(Kim Suk Jin of BTS)

2639
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,390
(A running middle-aged man,
Ji Suk Jin)

2640
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:30,390
I drink black herbal tea.

2641
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:32,460
Gosh, it's hot.

2642
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,130
(The same name, the opposite lives)

2643
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:37,360
(Dad jokes)

2644
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,600
I like dad jokes.

2645
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,730
I'm a dad.

2646
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:42,670
(The similar but different
two universes meet.)

2647
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:43,810
Hey, Jimin.

2648
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:44,810
Hey, Tae Hyung.

2649
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:47,140
(I'm the oldest member of BTS.)

2650
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,430
How dare you talk to me like that?

2651
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:50,050
I'm the oldest member
of Running Man.

2652
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,440
- I'm...
- I'm...

2653
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,550
Suk Jin.

2654
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:01,060
I bet this is Jin.

2655
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,090
Darn it.

2656
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,260
(Peekaboo)

2657
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,730
This Suk Jin is too different.

2658
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:05,780
Can I change my team?

2659
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,300
(I will use the transfer card.)

2660
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:09,670
(The infernal transfer race
where they betray each other)

2661
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:11,430
(Different looks)

2662
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:13,270
(But the physiques are
no different?)

2663
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:15,170
(The Suk Jin
who turns out to be weird...)

2664
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:16,230
(and the Suk Jin
who's always been weird)

2665
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:17,600
(Whose universe will win?)

2666
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,270
(Suk Jin Versus Suk Jin)

2667
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:20,710
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
