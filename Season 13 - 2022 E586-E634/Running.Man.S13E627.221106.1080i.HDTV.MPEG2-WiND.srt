1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,560
In May, 2020, NASA scientists...

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,520
reported they've found
a parallel universe.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,660
("Parallel Universe,
Another Earth And Me")

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,930
("Parallel Universe,
Where Another Me Lives?")

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,600
(Two different universes...)

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,740
(Under the same name)

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,940
(The beginning of the beginning...)

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,640
(is ungraspable.)

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,280
(Two similar,
but unlike universes were born.)

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,610
(Somewhere in Korea
on another earth)

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:52,140
(A man reads the world news
in the quiet morning.)

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,500
(Kim Suk Jin of BTS)

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,140
At 8 a.m., every morning,

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,280
I drink Americano.

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,660
At 8 a.m., every morning,

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,830
I drink black herbal tea.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,210
So hot.

18
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,530
Darn it.

19
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,440
(Ji Suk Jin as an independent)

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,410
(While Ji Suk Jin sucks
his fingers greedily...)

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
(Dad Joke Collection)

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,610
How did one think
of a joke like this?

23
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,220
If one handwrites...

24
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,580
a letter of apology,

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
it's a "handy apology."

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,720
I like dad jokes.

27
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,860
I'm a dad.

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,330
(Massaging his wrinkles)

29
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,440
Coldplay is cool.

30
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,580
I know Coldplay.

31
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,350
They're good.

32
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,320
Coldplay knows me.

33
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,560
Hello?

34
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,930
Hey, Jimin.

35
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,760
I'm the oldest member of BTS.

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,190
Want to meet up there? Okay.

37
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,600
I was home all day.

38
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,500
I'm the oldest member
of Running Man.

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,130
I wouldn't be weaker than you.

40
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,910
I'll go. You punk.

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,750
I'm...

42
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,410
I'm...

43
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,190
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

44
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,820
(The border between two universes
is torn down.)

45
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,840
(Two universes that aren't
supposed to collide.)

46
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,030
(Only one universe will survive.)

47
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,410
(Suk Jin Universe began just
because they have the same name.)

48
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,650
They'll be shocked to see this.

49
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,620
To see that.

50
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
(Acting cute)

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,190
I'm excited to be on TV.

52
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,660
This is my first time
on a variety show.

53
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,690
- Really?
- I'm so thrilled.

54
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,030
Just have fun.

55
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,790
I'm charming. Don't worry.

56
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,630
You and Jin are the captains
of each team.

57
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,910
Every member is waiting
in a different place.

58
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

59
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,130
Hello.

60
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,250
You'll be riding the car
that looks the same...

61
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,850
and stop right in front
of each member.

62
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,650
Each member will choose the car
based on the remaining seats.

63
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,450
People in the same car
will form a team.

64
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,060
This is going to be fun.

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,790
They better choose carefully.

66
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,370
Is it going to be Jin of BTS
or Suk Jin the Big Nose?

67
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,130
Now, we will start.

68
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,660
Let's go.

69
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,000
Do both cars stop at the same time?

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,910
- Two cars will arrive soon.
- Really?

71
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,850
There are captains in each car.

72
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,050
I see.

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,140
- We don't get to know who they are?
- No.

74
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,820
Which one should I choose?
The remaining seats?

75
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,950
Yes.

76
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,860
By remaining seats,
do you mean the available seats?

77
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,190
(What will they be riding?)

78
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,730
(Who do you want to team up with?)

79
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,760
Me?

80
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,940
If I think only about the game,

81
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,870
Jong Kook would be the best choice.

82
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,980
Jae Suk has good hunches.

83
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,640
He'd get in this car.

84
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,270
I'm curious.

85
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,990
I can't wait.
They'll wander around...

86
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,010
and think about which car to choose.

87
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,710
I see Jae Suk.

88
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,650
He's confused.

89
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,560
It's Jae Suk.

90
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,630
I'm excited to see celebrities.

91
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,200
I heard that Jin of BTS would be
on our show today.

92
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,670
I have a feeling...

93
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,500
that I'll have to choose
between Jin and Suk Jin.

94
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,200
Gosh. This is ridiculous.

95
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,980
Do you think this makes sense?

96
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,140
Jae Suk, we're here.
The two vehicles arrived.

97
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,920
Jae Suk.

98
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,250
I'll be very sad
if Jae Suk doesn't choose me.

99
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,360
It will be very disappointing.

100
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,150
Oh, man. I have no idea.

101
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,150
I can't see the inside at all.

102
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,130
Jin or Suk Jin.

103
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,650
Of course, I would choose Jin.

104
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,630
There's no need to ask.

105
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,690
I mean, I see Seok Sam so often.

106
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,960
We talk on the phone often too.
Of course, I'd choose Jin.

107
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,810
All right. I choose Jin!

108
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,900
He's coming.

109
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,980
Which one of us will he choose?

110
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,310
(Could Jae Suk choose
Jin's vehicle?)

111
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,340
My gut is telling me
that Jin is in here.

112
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,140
(Which of the team captains
did Jae Suk choose?)

113
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,320
I have a feeling that Jin's in here.

114
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,790
Darn it.

115
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,390
(He chose Suk Jin, not Jin.)

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,070
(It ruined Jae Suk's day
first thing in the morning.)

117
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,260
Why...

118
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,000
Why is this van here?

119
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,070
Why is it here?

120
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,330
- Hey, get in.
- But... Hyo Im.

121
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,810
- Then the van... Gosh.
- Get in already.

122
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,700
- Gosh. Jin!
- Just get in.

123
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,480
Jae Suk!

124
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,820
- I'm disappointed.
- He's in the other van.

125
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,750
I'm so disappointed.

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,820
I want to cry.

127
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,710
- Seriously. I'm so upset.
- Hey, it was 1 of the 2 vans.

128
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,290
- I know, but...
- Right?

129
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,860
Gosh. I joined Suk Jin's team.
This is the worst.

130
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,930
(Welcome. I love you.)

131
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,430
Gosh. This is frustrating.

132
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,260
Darn. I can't believe this.

133
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,730
- Can I move to another team later?
- No, you can't.

134
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,500
I heard about the rules. This is it.

135
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,540
This is it.
You'll be on my team all day.

136
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,260
Oh, man.
I wanted to join Jin's team.

137
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,270
(He feels hopeless
about today's race.)

138
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,340
(Without knowing how upset
Jae Suk is, Jin finds it funny.)

139
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,770
Now, I see that Running Man
really is an unscripted show.

140
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,920
(Jin confirmed
that it's an unscripted show.)

141
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,320
- Gosh. This is the worst.
- Oh, my.

142
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,320
Hey, why are you so downcast?

143
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,650
Who's next?

144
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,360
I can recognize him by his legs.
He must be Jong Kook.

145
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,430
I hope Jong Kook will come to me.

146
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,000
(Trainer Kook is doing
shadow boxing as always.)

147
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,500
Jong Kook, I'm bored.
Please choose my team.

148
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,090
If you go there as well,
I'll be so sad.

149
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,440
There are 3 and 2 seats left
in the vans?

150
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,460
Here I go.

151
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,810
(He walks straight to one
of the vans without hesitating.)

152
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,400
- I think he's coming to us.
- Is Jong Kook...

153
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,900
- going to join us?
- I think he is.

154
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,750
- If he comes, our team...
- Great.

155
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,070
Jong Kook, please come to me.

156
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,550
(Will he join the members
or the person he rarely gets to see?)

157
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,820
(Jong Kook is slowly approaching.)

158
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,700
(Which team did Jong Kook choose?)

159
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,400
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Oh, my. Hey.

160
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,200
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Oh, my. Hey.

161
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,530
- Hi. I'm so happy to see you.
- I'm surprised. Hey.

162
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,160
Hi. I thought...

163
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,600
I would've been so sad...

164
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,080
- if you chose the other team too.
- Hey.

165
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,040
Why did everyone go there?
I don't understand.

166
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,510
- Only Jae Suk is there.
- Really?

167
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,080
Oh, no.
Jin must be uncomfortable with him.

168
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,280
- I wish I were there.
- Jin must be uncomfortable.

169
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,890
- I wish you were there too.
- Gosh.

170
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,590
It's because
you're good at buttering people up.

171
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,560
- How dare you?
- You're good at it.

172
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,390
- Don't say that.
- You're good at it.

173
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,420
I'm caring
and considerate of others.

174
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,220
Jong Kook can never
butter others up.

175
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,460
- Gosh, seriously.
- Gosh.

176
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,140
Hey, I haven't seen you
in a long time.

177
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,570
- I saw you...
- Have you been well?

178
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,010
We ran into each other...

179
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,410
- at a restaurant in the US.
- Right.

180
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,280
- That's right.
- Yes.

181
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,050
- That was 3 or 4 years ago.
- Yes. You remember that.

182
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,710
- After my group's concert.
- Right.

183
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,870
- We heard you were there too.
- Yes, that's right.

184
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,590
- So we went to say hi to you.
- Yes.

185
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,190
You and your group members came.

186
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,420
I was enjoying the food.
It was so unexpected.

187
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,690
(I was enjoying the food.
It was so unexpected.)

188
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,190
Most of my close friends
live in Los Angeles.

189
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,750
- Really?
- Yes, it's true.

190
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,700
You see, I'm from Anyang.

191
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,030
- But rather than Anyang...
- Oh, I'm...

192
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,330
- Anyang in Gyeonggi Province?
- Yes.

193
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,530
Anyang is my hometown too.

194
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,700
- Where in Anyang?
- I...

195
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,760
- I don't know. I was born there.
- Really?

196
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,810
- You were born in Anyang?
- After that, I lived in Gwacheon.

197
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,840
Oh, that's... I had no idea.

198
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,210
I didn't know you were from Anyang.

199
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,280
I've never seen any celebrities
from Anyang.

200
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,320
Hey, I was born and raised
in Anyang.

201
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,090
- No wonder why you chose this van.
- Hey. I...

202
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,110
Hey.

203
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,210
Despite our age difference,

204
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,480
- Come on.
- we seem to have things in common.

205
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,980
I'm not so young. I'm 31.

206
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,750
- Really? Then...
- Yes.

207
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,330
Aren't you in your late 30s?

208
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,700
Did I go too far?

209
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,620
- Oh, no.
- That's nice. I'm flattered.

210
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,090
That's not too much.
Foreigners think I'm in my 30s.

211
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,070
- Of course.
- Yes. They say I look young.

212
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,710
Some people think I'm a teenager.

213
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,440
You look like a teenager.

214
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,410
- Did I go too far?
- Not at all.

215
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,870
Foreigners would think
you're in high school.

216
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,450
People would definitely think
you're a high school student...

217
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,710
- if you go to the US.
- Jong Kook.

218
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,110
Are you flattering me
because I'm a superstar?

219
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,610
No, I'm not.

220
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,320
I haven't heard anyone who called
himself a superstar in a while.

221
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,460
- People like it when I do that.
- Of course.

222
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,030
- They don't want me to be modest.
- Right.

223
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,800
That's true. Times have changed.

224
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,940
- I hope So Min comes to us.
- Me too.

225
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,170
- I want to see her disappointed.
- Exactly.

226
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,600
(They're on the same page.)

227
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,580
- I really want...
- I want to see her disappointed.

228
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,640
to see her disappointed face.

229
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,950
If she sees Jin,

230
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,210
she'd say hello coyly. "Hello."

231
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,870
- I hate it when she does that.
- I don't want to see that.

232
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,450
- I hate the sight of that.
- She'd tug her hair like this.

233
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,240
- "Hello."
- "Hello." I hate that.

234
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,420
"I'm a fan of yours."

235
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,210
- Gosh. I hate the sight of that.
- I hate the sight of that.

236
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,090
Why are you swaying my heart?

237
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,490
Why are you...

238
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,220
- I think you sang the wrong lyrics.
- Did I?

239
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,760
(Is she already singing BTS' song?)

240
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,330
We'll be having a guest today, right?

241
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,490
There must be our guests
in the two vehicles. Right?

242
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,810
(It seems that her secret informant
told her about the guest again.)

243
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,870
I'm excited... Stop laughing.

244
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,210
(She's elated while waiting.)

245
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,240
Could there be no remaining seats?
That won't happen, right?

246
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,310
This must be it. I think we're here.

247
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,010
She might be able to see my face.

248
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,290
You look so different from Jin.
Covering your face is pointless.

249
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,510
But she might be able to
get a glimpse of my face.

250
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,880
No. She can never see your face.

251
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,690
- She might.
- She can't see through the window.

252
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,960
Who is that?

253
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,750
He has his back toward us.
That's Haha.

254
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,660
- Haha...
- I hope he won't turn around.

255
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,590
Haha should absolutely join us.

256
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,530
Okay. Got it.

257
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,360
(The two vehicles stop
in front of Haha.)

258
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,710
There are two remaining seats
in this one...

259
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,730
(Both of the vehicles have
two remaining seats.)

260
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,670
Gosh. What do I do?

261
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,630
- Who is that?
- Haha.

262
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,340
- Oh, Haha?
- Hold on.

263
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,970
I absolutely have no idea.

264
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,790
Gosh.

265
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,480
This one caught my eye
as soon as it arrived.

266
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,420
He should be with us.

267
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,480
He'll make Jin uncomfortable.

268
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,880
He'll make Jin so uncomfortable.
I'm sure he will.

269
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,060
(The kid goes crazy
when he sees a hip celebrity.)

270
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,890
I've made my decision.

271
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,120
(He goes with his first instinct!)

272
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,260
Here...

273
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,830
(Chuckling)

274
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,490
- Gosh.
- Is this van for old fossils?

275
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,300
(They're not happy
to have him on the team either.)

276
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,760
- Gosh.
- Is this van for old fossils?

277
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,310
Jae Suk, are you the captain?

278
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,310
- Hey, Haha.
- Hey.

279
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,710
- I'm really...
- I'm the captain of the team.

280
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,500
- Oh, you're the captain? Okay.
- Hey.

281
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,870
You should've chosen Jin of BTS.

282
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,610
You didn't know?

283
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,920
Why did you...

284
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,340
- I didn't know.
- Did you really not know?

285
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,690
Is Jin of BTS in that van?

286
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,790
Yes, he is.

287
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,560
- Is Jin in this van?
- I guess he really didn't know.

288
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,620
- He doesn't seem to have known.
- I think he didn't know.

289
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,560
- Gosh.
- He didn't know?

290
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,800
He has no global vibe.

291
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,930
- Having a global vibe is important.
- Yes.

292
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,760
- We've both been to LA, you know.
- Exactly.

293
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,260
- LA and Anyang.
- That's right.

294
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,730
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

295
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,340
Oh, man.

296
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,440
(He lost the world star
in front of his eyes.)

297
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,180
My gosh. I could've chosen him.

298
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,780
- Is it Suk Jin versus Suk Jin?
- Yes.

299
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,550
- I was going to...
- You didn't know, did you?

300
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,080
- give you a chance...
- I didn't know.

301
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,640
- My gosh.
- Gosh, seriously.

302
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,690
Suk Jin versus Suk Jin?
That's unexpected.

303
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,090
- What a shame.
- How come you didn't know?

304
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,030
- This is amazing though.
- Right.

305
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,700
I'm surprised you made it this far,
Suk Jin.

306
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,300
- What do you mean by that?
- I was just saying...

307
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,560
- that this is great.
- What do you mean?

308
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,330
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

309
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,930
Don't get me wrong.

310
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,540
You're surprised I made it this far?

311
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,170
I mean, you're incredibly lucky.

312
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,280
Suk Jin is never on par with
Jin of BTS. Not even close.

313
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,870
Hey, we have a lot in common.

314
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,240
This is so amazing.

315
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,370
- Wait. Who's that? Is she So Min?
- You're so lucky, Suk Jin.

316
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,970
- I think she is. She's with a dog.
- She's So Min.

317
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,210
- Isn't she So Min?
- Is she?

318
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,420
- Is she So Min?
- No, she's Ji Hyo.

319
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,510
Oh, she's Ji Hyo?

320
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,710
It has 1 remaining seat
while the other has 2.

321
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,660
I choose the van
with one remaining seat.

322
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,960
- Oh, she's coming. Hey.
- Hey.

323
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,090
(This is the van
with one remaining seat.)

324
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,590
I hope she won't come here.

325
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,170
(Silent)

326
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,280
- Get in.
- Why are you guys here?

327
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,140
Our team is full now.
The rest will join the other team.

328
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,280
- It's a shame.
- Yes, it's a shame.

329
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,870
Do you know who's in the other van?

330
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,920
- No, I don't know.
- You don't know?

331
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,140
- They didn't tell you, right?
- They didn't tell you?

332
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,740
- They didn't tell me.
- Jin of BTS is in there.

333
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,660
- Jin of BTS is in that van.
- Jin of BTS.

334
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,690
Hey, stop.

335
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Wait.

336
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,060
Hold on a second. What did you say?

337
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,590
- Jin of BTS is there.
- Jin of BTS is in the other van.

338
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,750
Jin of BTS is in that van?

339
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,930
- Yes.
- Really?

340
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,570
Don't come here.

341
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,300
(Knocking)

342
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,040
I won't get in.
Just open the door...

343
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,500
so that I can see Jin.

344
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,570
- No.
- I want to see Jin.

345
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,500
I'll roll down the window instead.

346
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,910
There. What is it?

347
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,080
- Jong Kook.
- Yes? Why?

348
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,950
- I heard Jin of BTS was here.
- Yes, he's here.

349
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,780
Open the door for me.
I'll leave after seeing him.

350
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,870
- I already chose my team.
- No. Since you've made...

351
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,450
- Since you've made your decision...
- I know.

352
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,190
- I just want to see him.
- He's right here.

353
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,660
- Hi, Jin. It's good to see you.
- Hi, Ji Hyo.

354
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,590
Hey. I should've chosen this van.

355
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,980
I'm sorry, but don't be like this.

356
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,350
- I won't get in. I chose my team.
- Good.

357
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,930
- Let me at least shake his hand.
- No. Wait.

358
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,960
- It's good to see you, Ji Hyo.
- I wish I had chosen this van.

359
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
I missed you.

360
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,670
- You guys are...
- Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

361
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,130
So unlucky. Both you and Haha.

362
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,340
Then...

363
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,460
So Min will join you guys.

364
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,470
So Min and Se Chan will be
on our team...

365
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,730
- automatically.
- Yes, they'll be on our team.

366
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,640
- See you later, Ji Hyo.
- See you in a bit.

367
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,470
You must be disappointed.

368
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,870
Gosh, why did I choose this van
and team up with you guys?

369
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,480
(Looking at their faces
makes her feel even angrier.)

370
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,710
We feel the same way.

371
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,560
Our van smells like an old man.

372
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,190
Can you put something else on the screen?
That drives me crazy.

373
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,790
- Gosh.
- Your team is complete now.

374
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,120
- Got it.
- We'll get going now.

375
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,220
Our team is complete?

376
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,570
Gosh. This is ridiculous.

377
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,700
(The team combination ruined
their mood from the start.)

378
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
(The vans arrived
in front of Se Chan this time.)

379
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Can you step away from the van
a little bit?

380
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,210
There's no remaining seat?

381
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,210
No remaining seat?

382
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,310
(Team Suk Jin was sold out
very quickly.)

383
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,370
Does it mean
I can't choose that van?

384
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,280
I can't join that team? Is it full?

385
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,470
Should I get in that van?

386
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,710
So it's not that I have a choice,
right?

387
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,880
Is something wrong?

388
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,660
- Hello.
- Hey.

389
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,330
- You startled me. Oh, my.
- You're lucky.

390
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,060
(Jin appears.)

391
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,350
You startled me. Oh, my.

392
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,530
- You're lucky.
- Hello.

393
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,360
- Hold on. Goodbye.
- Where are you going?

394
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,430
- Hello.
- Hold on.

395
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,170
(Hello. Goodbye.)

396
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,840
- Where are you going?
- My gosh. What's going on?

397
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,410
Jong Kook. Hello, Jin.

398
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,370
- Hello, Se Chan.
- You're so lucky.

399
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,410
This is...

400
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,000
- Oh, no. It's closing again.
- It's refusing to let you in.

401
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,640
It won't let me in.

402
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,050
(This van won't let me in.)

403
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,370
Oh, my. Jin is here.

404
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,840
- Hello.
- Hello. It's nice to meet you.

405
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
- It's nice to meet you too.
- Right.

406
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,640
- Are we on the same team?
- Please get in.

407
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,320
- Yes, we are.
- Yes!

408
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
- Hey, get in.
- My goodness.

409
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,750
Why are you dressed
like Inspector Gadget?

410
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,030
The weather is quite...

411
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,990
- I mean... Hello.
- Hello.

412
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,460
I've watched many videos on YouTube.

413
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,620
- Really? Do you know who I am?
- Yes.

414
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,360
- Of course, I know who you are.
- "Do you know who I am?"

415
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,040
- You're a popular celebrity.
- Yes, he is.

416
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,260
I'm so excited to see him.
This is hard to believe.

417
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,680
My goodness. Jin of BTS is here.

418
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,910
It's my first time
seeing him in person.

419
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,210
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

420
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,340
Don't you know Jimin of BTS?

421
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,740
Jimin? No, not at all.

422
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,210
- Oh, I see.
- He knows Comedienne Kim Ji Min.

423
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,510
I do know Kim Ji Min.

424
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,590
He knows Comedienne Kim Ji Min
for sure.

425
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,820
I don't know
Jimin of BTS personally.

426
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,250
Do you prefer being called
Jin or Suk Jin?

427
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,010
I don't mind.
You can call me whatever you want.

428
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,160
- I'll call you Big Brother Jin.
- "Big Brother Jin?"

429
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,620
- He must be younger than you.
- Are you...

430
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,590
- It doesn't matter.
- Okay.

431
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,570
I address any rich men
as my big brothers.

432
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,860
- I have the same mindset.
- All rich men are my seniors.

433
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,200
- I call rich men big brothers too.
- Oh, I see.

434
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,540
I'll address Jin as my big brother.

435
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,570
All right, Se Chan.

436
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,680
Thank you.
I'll address Jin as my big brother.

437
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,840
All right, Se Chan.

438
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,230
(The superstar has
a great sense of humor.)

439
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,870
Just so you know,
Jin doesn't try to be modest.

440
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,920
- Really?
- He's rather straightforward.

441
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,520
- That's true.
- Great. Do whatever you want.

442
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,490
That's one of the social trends
these days, you know.

443
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,820
- One of the social trends.
- He calls himself a superstar.

444
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,650
- That's so cool.
- Indeed.

445
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,990
- I don't deny it.
- He doesn't deny it.

446
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,060
- It's true that I'm a superstar.
- Yes, it's true.

447
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,150
(While Se Chan is learning
how a superstar should behave...)

448
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,660
Thinking how excited So Min will get
annoys me a little bit.

449
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,240
- Jong Kook, is So Min joining us?
- Yes.

450
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,660
- We have the last seat.
- That's right.

451
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,770
I'll fall in love with So Min today.

452
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
- Good.
- All of a sudden.

453
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,240
- That's a good idea.
- So Min seems...

454
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,100
- to fall for every male guest.
- Yes, she does.

455
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,780
- You're right about that.
- I watch this show very often.

456
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,610
She liked every one of them.

457
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,640
And she has never said a word
about you.

458
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,610
- I'm disappointed. I really am.
- You should be.

459
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,410
Could I be alone in the car again?

460
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,790
(So Min has no idea
what's going on.)

461
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,850
Will I be abandoned like this?
I think I've been abandoned.

462
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,330
They must've chosen everyone else...

463
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,950
and had no choice but to pick me up.

464
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,270
Are they here?

465
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,630
(The vehicle that has no choice
but to pick her up arrives.)

466
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,770
- I remember...
- See? So Min is all dressed up.

467
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,900
- Look at her.
- Gosh. So Min is so...

468
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,980
I hate the sight of her.

469
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,750
- I'm so upset.
- She said she'd trim her bang.

470
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,550
- I guess it was because of this.
- How did she get the information?

471
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,020
- Exactly. How did she find out?
- We should catch her informant.

472
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,750
She always knows
what we'll get up to.

473
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,020
- How should we catch her informant?
- I really had no idea.

474
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,350
- How should we catch her informant?
- How does she get the information?

475
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,450
One of the vehicles has...

476
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,390
no remaining seat.

477
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,120
There's no remaining seat.

478
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,000
How many seats are there
in each vehicle?

479
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,660
Anyway...

480
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,860
(She gets upset to find out
she has no option.)

481
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,430
I knew it.
No wonder it was taking so long.

482
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,340
My gosh. Why...
I mean, there's no remaining seat...

483
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,340
- Hello, So Min.
- Oh, my. Hello.

484
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,340
- Gosh. She'll be so excited.
- I can't wait to see her reaction.

485
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,090
- There's no remaining seat...
- Hello, So Min.

486
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,340
Oh, my. Hello.

487
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,180
Hey, look at you.

488
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,760
You look as though you knew
he would be here.

489
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,230
I'm sorry, but I told him.

490
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,450
How come there's a seat left
in this van?

491
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,090
That's your luck.

492
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,470
Look how she's smiling.
She looks so excited.

493
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,800
Has she met Jin?

494
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,770
- Gosh, seriously.
- She looks so excited.

495
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,090
I don't even want to see her.

496
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,360
I hate the sight of her. Gosh.

497
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,130
- Gosh. I can hear her laugh.
- Gosh.

498
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,480
- I'm so upset.
- Jin must be...

499
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,310
Gosh. I wish I had chosen that team.

500
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,340
No.

501
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,370
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

502
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,720
Usually, men put their jackets
on a girl, right?

503
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,090
But Se Chan puts it on him too.
Isn't it strange?

504
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,990
- Why would you share it with me?
- It means that I own this coat.

505
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,990
- Maybe he wants to hold hands...
- This is how a romance is created.

506
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,830
- He wants to hold your hand...
- Exactly. Jin, just as I told you.

507
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,760
So Min, hold my hand under the coat.

508
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,350
- Come on. Hold my hand.
- No.

509
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,420
- Hey, look.
- You can't create a romance today.

510
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,090
- There are stars on the ceiling.
- Oh, my. What is that?

511
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,890
- What is this?
- It's for the superstar.

512
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,800
- Right. Look at the lights.
- Wow. It's nice.

513
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,930
What's with the mood lights?

514
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,930
Only luxury cars have stars
on the ceiling, right?

515
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,080
It says,
"This is Team Kim Suk Jin."

516
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
- "This is Team Kim Suk Jin."
- And Team Ji Suk Jin.

517
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,440
(They're moving to the place for
the Suk Jin Versus Suk Jin race.)

518
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,870
- Should we get out now?
- Let's get out.

519
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

520
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,350
- Ji Hyo, it'll be crazy today.
- Ji Hyo.

521
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,150
- Hey, Jin!
- It'll be crazy today, Suk Jin.

522
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,330
Jin, were you uncomfortable...
Where is he?

523
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,680
- I'm here.
- Were you uncomfortable?

524
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,090
- No, not at all.
- Weren't you?

525
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,730
- Was it okay without me?
- It was totally fine.

526
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,160
- Hey, Jin!
- My gosh. Jin.

527
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,300
- I mean, I'm so surprised.
- Hey, I...

528
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,690
- It's good to see you.
- Come here.

529
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,570
- I tried so hard to find your van.
- This is so unexpected.

530
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,630
- I was so sad you didn't come.
- I happened to join his team.

531
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,780
- Right. He must've been really sad.
- I really wanted to join his team.

532
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,340
- They're wearing the same sweater.
- Of course, I was sad.

533
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,580
It's so nice to be on Running Man.
I feel so welcomed.

534
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,140
Of course, you're welcome.

535
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,940
My gosh. I'm so upset.

536
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,140
- Yes.
- Hello.

537
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,820
Hello.

538
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,150
I was so lucky.

539
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,350
- I was lucky. I got in his van.
- Darn.

540
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,120
It's such a shame.

541
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,830
- I'm so upset.
- Okay.

542
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,190
Darn it.

543
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,770
Go away. He's on our team!

544
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,890
- Why did you come here?
- He's right.

545
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,360
- Seriously. Jin, listen to me.
- Gosh. I got so unlucky.

546
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,340
I think Haha is most disappointed
among you guys.

547
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,580
- Haha is greedy for such a thing.
- He always wants to look hip.

548
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,310
I'm here
because I let go of my greed.

549
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,170
Haha, there was only one seat left,
and I'm here now.

550
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,050
All three of them chose
the other van.

551
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,340
- Exactly.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.

552
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,880
- Jin of BTS is here!
- He's here.

553
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,090
This is incredible.

554
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,290
- Jin of BTS is on our show.
- This is hard to believe.

555
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,230
(Jae Suk dances to "Fire"
frivolously.)

556
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,650
- Jin came on Running Man.
- Yes.

557
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,190
Whenever I met Jin at events
like a film premiere,

558
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,470
he said,
"I want to be on Running Man."

559
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,590
- He told me that many times.
- Yes, I did.

560
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,770
- He told me that five times.
- I said it many times.

561
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,570
- Exactly.
- But I didn't get a chance.

562
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,630
BTS appeared on our show...

563
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,100
- when they just released "Fire."
- That's right.

564
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,050
- Yes. For about ten minutes.
- They appeared for a while.

565
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,790
(All members of BTS appeared
in the 300th episode 6 years ago.)

566
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,090
(All they did was
move 300 boxes in 10 minutes.)

567
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,650
- That was a shame.
- It must've been hard for them.

568
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,090
- You only made us move boxes.
- We pulled one another.

569
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,560
- They pulled a handcart too.
- That's right.

570
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,660
- Right.
- Yes, I remember that.

571
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,770
- They left after moving the boxes.
- Yes.

572
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,430
I revealed Jungkook's abs
by pulling his shirt up.

573
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,660
- Many of his fans thanked me.
- Really?

574
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,240
Yes. For showing his abs.

575
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,340
- V hugged me from behind...
- By the way...

576
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,400
- wearing my glasses. It went viral.
- He put on Haha's glasses.

577
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,780
- It's famous among BTS' fans.
- Oh, I didn't know that.

578
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,610
- Actually...
- You're talking like an old man.

579
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,440
- We're like old people chatting.
- The top star hugged me.

580
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Really?

581
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,560
That was so funny.

582
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,330
- You see, in 2018, Suk Jin...
- Yes.

583
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,850
called Jin, and he was asleep.

584
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,470
- Yes. I felt so bad about it.
- Oh, right.

585
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,470
I felt bad about it.

586
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,570
Hello.

587
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,190
Oh, my. Hello, Suk Jin.

588
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,430
Jin, were you sleeping?

589
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,430
(Suk Jin woke Jin up while he was
sleeping in the Netherlands.)

590
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,270
- He picked up while sleeping.
- I'm in the Netherlands.

591
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,400
- Sorry.
- I'm in the Netherlands now.

592
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,170
Since then, I put my phone
on silent before going to bed.

593
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,250
I'm really sorry about that.
I felt so bad back then.

594
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,870
- It must've made you uncomfortable.
- To be honest,

595
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,790
- you would understand me.
- Good for you.

596
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,020
- Good for you, Jin.
- I didn't know he was overseas.

597
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
He was in Europe when I called him,
and due to the time difference...

598
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,850
- I didn't know that.
- Why did you call him?

599
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,180
- Was it a mission?
- He pestered me to call Jin...

600
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,920
- to prove I knew Jin personally.
- Who did that?

601
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,120
- Oh, did I?
- He didn't believe me.

602
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,890
I said, "I could call him, but..."

603
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,070
- Suk Jin, I'm so sorry,
- Don't make him uncomfortable.

604
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,070
- but I want to hear from Jin.
- Right.

605
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,400
- But...
- We need more of Jin's voice.

606
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,470
- I'm just adding details.
- I know.

607
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,240
- But still...
- They'll edit it out anyway.

608
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,900
- Don't do that.
- Oh, they'll cut the part out.

609
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,980
Yes.

610
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,940
Suk Jin's comments will be
edited out.

611
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,480
- Actually...
- You'd better not tell the story.

612
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,520
- Continue.
- I really am close to Suk Jin.

613
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,490
We have had a drink together
on a private occasion.

614
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,590
- Really?
- Jin, when Suk Jin told me that,

615
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,230
I almost ran to you
to tell you not to do that again.

616
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,150
- Why?
- I heard you had paid the bill.

617
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,230
- I knew it.
- What?

618
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,470
- He didn't pay, right?
- I can't believe him.

619
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,470
- Suk Jin...
- You let him pay for your drinks?

620
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,000
- He let Jin pay for his drinks.
- I was going to pay...

621
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,860
- You should've...
- I was going to pay,

622
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,510
but he insisted on treating me.

623
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,900
- It's because he's a nice person.
- That's true.

624
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,870
- Gosh.
- Tell them what really happened.

625
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,930
- I treat others too, right?
- My gosh. Suk Jin.

626
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,480
As a superstar, I wanted
to treat my friend to a drink.

627
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,870
If that's the case,
we'll believe you.

628
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,250
- Okay. Since he put it like that...
- Suk Jin, why did you...

629
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,610
- Suk Jin isn't as rich as him.
- I mean...

630
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,990
When Suk Jin came,
we had already finished 1 or 2 bottles.

631
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,590
- But still...
- So he only had one glass.

632
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,990
- I said I would pay.
- He's so nice.

633
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,260
- He's explaining for Suk Jin.
- Exactly.

634
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,330
- He made Suk Jin look good.
- Jin's fans, you heard it, right?

635
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,470
Gosh.
Are the two of them really close?

636
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,340
- That can't be true.
- No!

637
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,130
(He doesn't want to believe
that they're friends.)

638
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,740
- But...
- Why wouldn't they be?

639
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,310
As you can see,
they're wearing the same clothes.

640
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,580
Hold on. Is yours a replica?

641
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,930
- Of course not.
- Suk Jin.

642
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,200
- Why doesn't it suit you?
- It's like you're in rags.

643
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,980
This costs 1,400 dollars!

644
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,980
- Aren't those rags?
- Seriously?

645
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,050
- This?
- I mean...

646
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,550
Is it that expensive?

647
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,180
The staff told my stylist...

648
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,290
that anything similar would be fine.

649
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,650
But my stylist wanted me to be
in the same sweater.

650
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,420
- So she got you that?
- How cool of her.

651
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,090
- Was it bought?
- Yes, it was bought.

652
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,860
- You bought it?
- Personally?

653
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,890
- That's right.
- Are you sure it's not a rag?

654
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,840
And the pants were provided
by BTS' staff.

655
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,160
The pants and the shoes.

656
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,810
- Originally...
- They provided them?

657
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,860
- So they weren't rags.
- You need to return them.

658
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,200
- Don't dirty them up.
- Of course.

659
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,310
- You can keep them.
- Really?

660
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,080
- You're giving them to him?
- For free?

661
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,440
I want to be generous.

662
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,580
- Thank you so much.
- Keep them.

663
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,750
- Jin gave them to him.
- When they're expensive?

664
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,820
- Are they expensive?
- Yes.

665
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,350
That's a different story, then.
You should return them.

666
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,180
- But...
- Jin's a superstar, Suk Jin.

667
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,790
You should return them
if they're expensive.

668
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,150
This isn't us
blowing things out of proportion.

669
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,350
- BTS truly is...
- Of course.

670
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,770
- Right.
- They're world-class.

671
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,800
And Jin...

672
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,160
called himself a superstar.

673
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
(A self-claimed superstar)

674
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,470
- Right?
- But it's true.

675
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm not wrong, am I?

676
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,740
- I'm not wrong.
- Right.

677
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,080
- He's not wrong.
- It's not a lie.

678
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,170
- I agree.
- This...

679
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,980
- is what I love about him.
- So this is what I said.

680
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,170
- What did you say?
- This is what I said.

681
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,340
That we have a superstar...

682
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,550
- on the side of Running Man.
- Who?

683
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,090
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- But he's...

684
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,020
- Compared to Jin...
- Unbelievable.

685
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,330
- Will you just stay put?
- Out of all of us,

686
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,450
- there's the one.
- Jin's an international star.

687
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,030
- International.
- You're a local star.

688
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,300
And I heard you were a rising star.

689
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,160
- A rising star?
- That's what we call him.

690
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,740
- A rising star.
- For 30 years...

691
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,770
- A rising star of 30 years.
- Still?

692
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,930
I should be on the rise,
but I haven't caught my break.

693
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,840
That's hilarious. Anyway...

694
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,480
Jin, you released a new album.

695
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,320
I guess you can say that.
It's a single, actually.

696
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,550
- What's the song?
- Tell us about it.

697
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,220
- It's called "The Astronaut."
- "The Astronaut."

698
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,850
(The Astronaut by Jin of BTS,
a collaboration with Coldplay...)

699
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,650
(brought us a light but dreamy
pop rock number.)

700
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,650
There's a band named Coldplay.

701
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,420
- Yes, we know them.
- They're a famous band.

702
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,030
And we collaborated with them
as a group before.

703
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,470
- Of course.
- We remember.

704
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,160
- This time around...
- Is it another collaboration?

705
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,660
- Yes. I expressed...
- Really?

706
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,200
how I'd love
to work with them again,

707
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,870
- and they...
- They got on board.

708
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,540
- They did.
- Of course they did.

709
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,170
Why would they decline
when it's Jin of BTS?

710
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,980
Just like I'd contact Rado,
you contacted Coldplay.

711
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,480
- No, not in that sense.
- Rado?

712
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,110
- Rado?
- You're comparing them to Rado?

713
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,650
- Rado and Coldplay?
- You're comparing them to Rado?

714
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,650
I can easily contact Rado, you know.

715
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,620
- But Rado...
- Yes, Rado.

716
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,830
I'm impressed since
I usually work with KCM.

717
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,850
Yes, KCM.

718
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,070
- What a collaboration.
- I can't believe it.

719
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,360
Anyway, what will we be doing today?

720
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,470
Welcome to Team Transfer:
Suk Jin Versus Suk Jin.

721
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,070
- I see.
- That's it.

722
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,660
The winning team
will get one penalty ball...

723
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,540
while the losing team
will get two penalty balls.

724
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,510
All those on the team
that gets chosen at the end...

725
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,480
will receive the penalty together.

726
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,170
Since this is
the Team Transfer Race,

727
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,840
the winning team...

728
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,590
will randomly be given
exchange tickets.

729
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,290
With this ticket,
you will be able to choose yourself,

730
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,730
a teammate, or even the captain
to be swapped.

731
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,450
A ticket booth will be set up today,

732
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,660
and the tickets can only
be used when it's open,

733
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,000
- not when it's closed.
- Right.

734
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,630
Before we begin the race,
the captains will be given...

735
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,700
three exchange tickets each
as an advantage.

736
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:42,480
- Nice.
- You can keep up to two.

737
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,080
The rest can be given
to any member on your team.

738
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,320
- Suk Jin, choose me.
- Hand them out right now.

739
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,050
- I'll swap teams with So Min.
- Sure.

740
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,680
- Exchange tickets.
- Thank you.

741
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,060
We don't need any
since we don't want to swap teams.

742
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,790
- They're coming for So Min.
- I should get one.

743
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,910
They're trying to drag
So Min over there.

744
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,060
- I should get one.
- Why?

745
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,530
- Because I should swap teams.
- Ji Hyo should have it...

746
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,350
so that she can
drag So Min off that team.

747
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,800
The ticket went to Ji Hyo.

748
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,730
What? If you hand it to me,

749
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,300
- I'll stay loyal to you.
- I'll do my best.

750
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,070
- Good luck.
- I'll do my best.

751
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,930
Well, Jin is from Anyang.

752
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,270
- Anyang?
- Yes, he was born there.

753
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,840
- Are you from Anyang?
- I was born there.

754
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,370
- He was born there.
- Really?

755
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,200
- Around Indeokwon Intersection.
- No wonder.

756
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,170
- My gosh.
- Then it's already over.

757
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,310
- Is it?
- From this moment on,

758
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,410
Jin will be my bias. That's right.

759
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,820
Says the man living in Gangnam.

760
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,180
- Then...
- You never know.

761
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,950
Since our hometowns are the same...

762
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,180
- Thank you.
- And you got on the van first.

763
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,620
- That's fair.
- The ticket went to Jong Kook.

764
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,650
- Well...
- I should've gotten in his van.

765
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,920
We'll proceed with the first game
after you change.

766
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,090
- All right.
- Sure.

767
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,840
Jin, how are you at foot volleyball?

768
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,010
- Here.
- I'm not that good at it.

769
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,070
- You're not good at it?
- It's all right.

770
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,280
- I'm glad.
- Why?

771
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,630
- Because it'll be fun.
- I'm bad at this too.

772
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,440
Jin, come to me with any complaints.

773
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,370
- You're making him uncomfortable.
- They all answer to me.

774
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,370
They all answer to you?

775
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,170
- Yes, they do.
- Okay.

776
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,590
Here are the rules.

777
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,940
- Sure.
- Go for it.

778
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,760
The first game is...

779
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,990
the Global DNA Rule Foot Volleyball.

780
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,620
It'll be a three-on-three match...

781
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,450
of foot volleyball
but with an add-on rule.

782
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,120
- Three-on-three.
- Violate the rule,

783
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,800
and the opposing team will score.

784
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,970
There's an add-on rule?

785
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,360
When one team
first scores 11 points,

786
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,770
- the add-on rule will change.
- Eleven points?

787
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,630
The first team to reach
21 points will win.

788
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,670
- Okay.
- Jong Kook won't get mad...

789
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,870
- even if Jin messes up.
- You won't have to worry.

790
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,820
Come on.
We all make mistakes in life.

791
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,680
Messing up is part of the fun.

792
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,680
- That's how you get better.
- Of course.

793
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,150
- You know how it is.
- No one's perfect.

794
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,990
This game is particularly important
because the winning team...

795
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,300
will not only win tickets
but also today's lunch.

796
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,650
- Then we must win.
- Let's get us some lunch.

797
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,270
- The jjamppong...
- The city is known...

798
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,090
- for its jjamppong.
- Top three in the country.

799
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,160
- One of the top three.
- Stay put, will you?

800
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,900
Just eat what is served.

801
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
(Upset)

802
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,840
- We're just saying.
- But I want the jjamppong.

803
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,200
Eat what is served.

804
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,670
- We're just telling you that.
- Jae Suk.

805
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,140
- We want the jjamppong.
- You've changed.

806
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,580
Paju is famous for its jjamppong.

807
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,780
- Really?
- Whenever we film in Paju,

808
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,590
we always order...

809
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,320
- the jjamppong you love.
- Right?

810
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,490
Nice!

811
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,060
- I must say this though.
- What is it?

812
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,560
Shouldn't we have
what Jin wants to eat?

813
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,920
Jae Suk, I also love jjamppong.

814
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,830
The jjamppong here is famous.

815
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,570
- Don't make him uncomfortable!
- I just...

816
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,160
- He says he likes jjamppong.
- Have whatever you want.

817
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,860
- It's famous here.
- Jin, ask for whatever you want.

818
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,070
I go around
eating nice things all the time.

819
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,570
- I mean it.
- See?

820
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,580
He always eats the best food.

821
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,050
- Hear me out.
- He always eats the best food.

822
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,900
Since you're in Paju,
you should have the jjamppong here.

823
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,980
- Guys, you know this, right?
- Know what?

824
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,550
He's young and rich, guys.

825
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,380
Of course he is.

826
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,590
He's the wealthiest
out of all of us.

827
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,820
Shut it, Suk Jin!

828
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,030
Did you tell me to shut it?
Are you kidding me?

829
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,450
Must we shut it
if we're not wealthy enough?

830
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,450
Move! I'm the captain of this team.

831
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,260
(Old and poor Suk Jin
takes the back seat.)

832
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,800
This is Running Man,
so just accept what's happening.

833
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,860
Okay, got it.
I'm loving your teamwork.

834
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,000
- You...
- Move it, will you?

835
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,630
- How dare you.
- Move!

836
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,100
- Move, Suk Jin!
- You're not worthy enough.

837
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,280
Exactly. Don't let yourself
get caught on camera with him.

838
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,670
My gosh.

839
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,200
The winning team
will have jjamppong...

840
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,750
while the losing team
will have a packed meal.

841
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,750
- Okay.
- I want the jjamppong.

842
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,480
What is in the packed meal?

843
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,790
- Do we get ramyeon?
- No.

844
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,290
It'll be hard to eat it
without ramyeon.

845
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,490
We should at least get some ramyeon.

846
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,150
The losing team will be in tears.

847
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,350
Exactly. Jin, isn't it sad?

848
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,990
I should post on social media
about how harsh the staff is.

849
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,850
(A chilling joke)

850
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,850
That's right.

851
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,730
He doesn't mess around, does he?

852
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,800
- He's a fun one.
- Ramyeon should do it though.

853
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,860
- Exactly.
- We should at least get ramyeon.

854
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,270
- Spare the losing team.
- Tell me about it.

855
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,740
- On your left is the ticket booth.
- Right.

856
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,840
Anyone who has a ticket
can go up to it at any time...

857
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,810
and make the exchange.

858
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,670
- Can we swap out the captains?
- Really?

859
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,050
- Yes, you can.
- What?

860
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,490
Even the captains?

861
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,680
(Even the captains can swap teams.)

862
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,290
We can swap out the captains later.

863
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,560
We should wait
and swap teammates out later.

864
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,620
- To keep the team intact.
- Let's not waste the tickets.

865
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,560
Here's the first add-on rule.

866
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,950
(First add-on rule:
Speak only in English)

867
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,360
You are to only speak in English.

868
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,890
- Okay.
- If you're ready,

869
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,470
- please choose your three players.
- I see.

870
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,860
- How do I do?
- Can you speak English?

871
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,430
- How do I do?
- Yes.

872
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,310
Speak in English? Okay.

873
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,740
- How do I look?
- Okay.

874
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,900
Can you speak Korean?

875
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,200
Korea, what?

876
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,780
- Korea.
- He said "Korean."

877
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,370
- The south, why?
- Go, South!

878
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,370
- South Korea.
- Go, South!

879
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,170
Can you speak Korean?

880
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,080
- Why? I'm South Korean.
- We can only speak English.

881
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,090
- Okay, good.
- Do it.

882
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,680
- Let's do it.
- I can do it.

883
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,610
The add-on rule will now be applied.

884
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,290
It will now be applied.

885
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,260
You are to play, okay?

886
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,030
- Will you rest?
- I'll rest.

887
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,650
Sure. You rest.

888
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,860
Okay. I'll rest.

889
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,190
I'm defense.

890
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,630
Okay. Defense.

891
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,970
- You, offense.
- I'll take the side.

892
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,160
- The offense.
- Right, and you...

893
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,900
- Yes?
- Let's change places.

894
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,870
- Change it up.
- Play defense.

895
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,430
Let it bounce three times. Okay?

896
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,580
Yes.

897
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,080
Okay, let's go.

898
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,940
Game... Three of us.

899
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,980
- Three people.
- Three members.

900
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,490
- Okay.
- Right.

901
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,990
- So Min.
- Can I play?

902
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,790
- Sure.
- Okay!

903
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,620
We have to.

904
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,450
- We have to.
- I understand.

905
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,690
I can play!

906
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,560
Se Chan, aren't you playing?

907
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,030
No. I'll stay here.

908
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,270
- You'll stay?
- That's the rule.

909
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,160
- What about our positions?
- Positions?

910
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,270
You can stay right here,
and you can stay right here.

911
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,270
- Okay.
- I'm here.

912
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,470
- All right.
- Let's get it!

913
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,170
- Come on.
- Start.

914
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,170
(It begins with Jong Kook's serve.)

915
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,280
Okay, go.

916
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,580
- Okay.
- Nice.

917
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,840
Okay.

918
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,250
- Okay, you.
- Okay.

919
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,440
- Okay!
- Me!

920
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,590
- Hey, Jin.
- Okay, Jin.

921
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,320
- Okay, Jin.
- Okay!

922
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,260
- Out!
- Okay!

923
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,650
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

924
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,060
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

925
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,260
- That's okay.
- Sorry.

926
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,070
You did a good job.

927
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,270
Very good, Jin.

928
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,620
- Very good?
- You...

929
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,800
- You were very good.
- I'm sorry.

930
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,270
- Very good?
- Yes.

931
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,070
You played fantastically.

932
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,780
Okay, right. But I'm sorry.

933
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,810
My team first.

934
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,980
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

935
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,170
What are you doing, Ji Hyo?

936
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,670
- Come on.
- What are you doing over there?

937
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,980
What are you doing right now?

938
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,990
Are you changing the teams up?

939
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,320
- Really?
- What are you doing?

940
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,060
What are you doing, Ji Hyo?

941
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,720
- I'll spend my ticket.
- What are you doing over there?

942
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,090
I'll swap teams with So Min.

943
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,180
Already?

944
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,560
Yes, I'll swap teams with her.

945
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,730
(She swaps teams with So Min
just like she planned.)

946
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,270
- Really?
- Yes.

947
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,270
Who?

948
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,860
- What are you doing?
- You're swapping teams?

949
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,340
Change.

950
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,900
- Who?
- Ji Hyo...

951
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,300
used the exchange ticket
to switch with So Min.

952
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,510
(So Min transfers
to Team Ji Suk Jin.)

953
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,010
Okay.

954
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,070
- Very good.
- Let's go.

955
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,450
- Very good.
- Goodbye.

956
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,220
- Oh, my gosh.
- Come on.

957
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,950
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

958
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,450
- Oh, no.
- Come here.

959
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,390
- Come here.
- Me too.

960
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,280
- Goodbye. Hello.
- Very good.

961
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,200
- Come on.
- Hey, So Min.

962
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,300
- Hey, Jin.
- What?

963
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,570
So Min is out. Why are you smiling?

964
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,320
Sorry.

965
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,530
Sorry.

966
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,600
(Well...)

967
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,740
- Okay.
- That's okay.

968
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,030
You're a referee. Okay?

969
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,350
Referee?

970
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,010
- Hey.
- Here.

971
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,120
- Your spot.
- You...

972
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,370
- You stay.
- You...

973
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,870
- Sit down.
- My home.

974
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,240
- Sit down please.
- My home.

975
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,740
- Sit down.
- Hey.

976
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,120
- You're very small.
- You're glued here. Okay?

977
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,550
- Glue?
- Glue.

978
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,590
(He's telling her
not to move from here.)

979
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,260
- Let's go.
- It's a team play.

980
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,950
- Go.
- Okay. Play.

981
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,050
- Jin.
- Okay.

982
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,820
- You.
- Work hard, okay?

983
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,970
Mine?

984
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,140
Good.

985
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
Mine?

986
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,340
(Ji Hyo's sudden smash)

987
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,530
Yes. Nice.

988
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,700
(Referee Jeon saved it.)

989
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,600
- Hey.
- You.

990
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,010
(Jong Kook's unexpected mistake)

991
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,280
- Hey. Go.
- What are you doing?

992
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,850
- What was that play?
- Ji Hyo.

993
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,820
- That was a terrible play.
- I'm sorry.

994
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,490
- Sorry.
- Sorry. It's okay.

995
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,820
Ji Hyo did well.

996
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,660
- So Min. You did well.
- Yes.

997
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,890
Ji Hyo did well.

998
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,120
- Yes.
- You did well.

999
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
You were very nice.

1000
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,260
- Well done. Okay.
- Unbelievable.

1001
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,370
Let's go.

1002
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,370
(They begin with Haha's serve.)

1003
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,660
Go.

1004
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,510
Why is that whistle so weak?

1005
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,910
It was so weak.

1006
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,370
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1007
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,370
- Let's go.
- Hurry up.

1008
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,450
- Okay. Mine.
- Jin.

1009
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,570
(Jin loses a point.)

1010
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,780
Header.

1011
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,990
- Jin.
- Mine.

1012
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,180
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1013
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,390
- It's 3 to 0.
- It's okay?

1014
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,590
(That was okay?)

1015
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,430
- Yes.
- That was okay?

1016
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,620
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1017
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,760
- Jong Kook.
- Are you sure?

1018
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,100
How come you don't blame him?

1019
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,340
My leg is broken.

1020
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,490
- Sorry.
- Why don't you blame him?

1021
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,070
- Good. It's okay.
- Jin.

1022
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,260
- Oh, my gosh.
- You're terrible.

1023
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,340
- I'm terrible. Sorry.
- You're terrible.

1024
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,470
He's terrible, but it's okay.

1025
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,850
- Sorry.
- No.

1026
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,850
- Okay.
- It's okay.

1027
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,240
Do you have Instagram?

1028
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,510
- Sorry.
- Good.

1029
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,570
So sorry.

1030
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,120
- No Instagram.
- No Instagram?

1031
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,390
- You're very good.
- You're good.

1032
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,850
- You're playing good.
- Okay.

1033
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,760
- Instagram?
- You're very good.

1034
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,030
- No Instagram.
- Instagram?

1035
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,260
Just joking.

1036
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,620
- I'm funny.
- No jokes.

1037
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,820
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Let's go.

1038
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,490
- Okay.
- You.

1039
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,490
- Okay.
- Great.

1040
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,530
Okay. It's out. Good.

1041
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,430
- Jong Kook.
- You're terrible.

1042
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,840
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo. You're terrible.

1043
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,350
- You're terrible.
- You're the same.

1044
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,140
- You're the same.
- You're also terrible.

1045
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,370
- Okay.
- Okay.

1046
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,950
- Okay.
- Hey, referee.

1047
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,640
- Go.
- What?

1048
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,050
- Your zone.
- Excuse me.

1049
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,510
Hey. Start the game.

1050
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,220
Why? I'm lonely.

1051
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,820
- Okay.
- Okay.

1052
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,180
- Okay. Jin.
- Use your head.

1053
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,590
- Good.
- Mine.

1054
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,050
- All right.
- Good.

1055
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,800
- Nice.
- Nice. Hey.

1056
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,220
- Hey.
- Nice.

1057
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,760
- Good.
- Very good.

1058
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,840
- Nice teamwork.
- Good.

1059
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,470
- Concentrate, okay?
- Suk Jin.

1060
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,870
- Okay.
- Suk Jin.

1061
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,340
- Yes?
- Use your brain.

1062
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,640
You want to use your brain?

1063
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,850
Head touch play.

1064
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,970
You want to use your stone brain?

1065
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,550
- Oh, my gosh.
- Your head is a stone.

1066
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
Your head is a stone.

1067
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,390
- My head is a stone?
- Yes.

1068
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,850
You have the bird's brain.

1069
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,390
- A bird?
- A bird.

1070
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,910
"A bird's brain."

1071
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,350
You have the frog's face.

1072
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,850
- The bird brain.
- Hey.

1073
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,320
- Let's go.
- A chicken brain.

1074
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,550
- "A chicken brain."
- Let's go.

1075
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,260
Hey. Be quiet.

1076
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,160
- I think...
- Jong Kook is...

1077
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,530
I think...

1078
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:13,240
you guys are too low level.
Let's change the rule.

1079
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,300
Too low?

1080
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,840
Hey.

1081
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,470
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1082
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,800
- Are we changing it?
- This time...

1083
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,820
- "Low level?"
- "Low level?"

1084
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,320
- "Low level?"
- How could you say that?

1085
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,090
- We're doing our best.
- What?

1086
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,450
Did you say "low level?"

1087
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,720
- "Low level?"
- Okay. Good.

1088
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,450
Just say no English is allowed.

1089
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,090
This time, no English.

1090
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,350
- Yes.
- That's better.

1091
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,220
This is bad.
We've been talking in English.

1092
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,350
- I'm very fluent in Korean.
- I'm used to it now.

1093
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,260
I was about to be put off
by a few people.

1094
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,930
A few people. All right.

1095
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,930
- We can do it.
- Suk Jin. How about a switch?

1096
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,970
What? Where?

1097
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,010
- Sure.
- I'll play.

1098
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,470
- Okay.
- No talking is the best.

1099
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,070
- Let's go.
- Don't talk, everyone.

1100
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,200
- All right.
- We'll go first.

1101
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,220
- Let's go.
- It's hard not to use English...

1102
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,780
even though we aren't fluent
in English.

1103
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,850
All right. Let's go.

1104
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,140
Ji Hyo. I'm sending it to you.

1105
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,450
- Me? Why?
- Stand in front.

1106
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,760
That's right. Good job.

1107
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,030
- All right.
- Here I go.

1108
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,930
- All right.
- Here I go.

1109
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,720
- Okay.
- It's me.

1110
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,820
- Okay.
- It's me.

1111
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,120
Hey.

1112
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,930
(Jae Suk spoke in English
as soon as the game started.)

1113
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,370
It only began, and you say okay?

1114
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,530
- What did he do?
- Was it you?

1115
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,910
- Good job.
- It's my habit.

1116
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,430
- I say okay all the time.
- Just don't talk.

1117
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,740
Good.

1118
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,200
- Good.
- Very good.

1119
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,370
- Good.
- Okay.

1120
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,820
- I won't talk.
- Very good.

1121
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,010
From now on, if you make a mistake,
you're out.

1122
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,620
- Let's do that.
- I'll just keep my mouth closed.

1123
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,780
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1124
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,910
Get ready.

1125
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,490
- I'll stay here.
- Good.

1126
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,680
- Mine...
- I'll stay here.

1127
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,680
- Mine...
- I'll stay here.

1128
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,820
- Good.
- Haha said mine.

1129
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,070
- Mine?
- Why did you say mine?

1130
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,600
"Mine" when you can't
even speak English?

1131
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,890
- My name.
- This is nice.

1132
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,600
- Good job.
- Good.

1133
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,700
Good job.

1134
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,700
Why do you keep using foreign words?

1135
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,240
- He's right.
- Seriously.

1136
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,340
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

1137
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,370
There's no progress.

1138
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,370
English...

1139
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,240
- Who is it?
- So Min.

1140
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,050
- Who is it?
- So Min.

1141
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,180
Hey!

1142
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,220
Hey. That's the right direction.

1143
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,820
- So Min.
- Hey.

1144
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,030
(Header in the wrong direction)

1145
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,350
- Hey. That's the right direction.
- Nice.

1146
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,490
- Good.
- That was awesome.

1147
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,160
- Very good.
- What are you doing?

1148
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,760
I've never seen anything
like that before.

1149
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,370
- Who do you think you are?
- Let me go.

1150
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,930
- Let me go.
- That was a suicide goal.

1151
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,390
- How could you...
- Just don't play.

1152
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,700
Haha. You just said "goal."

1153
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,760
Why send it there?

1154
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,370
- Suicide goal.
- I said own ball.

1155
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,530
You said a goal.

1156
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,180
- You get a point.
- That's good.

1157
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,370
- Good. Very good.
- That's very good.

1158
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,680
You're the Justice Pao.

1159
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,070
It's nine to six.

1160
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,490
- We're six?
- Get ready.

1161
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,490
- What's our score?
- We've got to win this round.

1162
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,950
- Focus.
- Haha.

1163
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,410
Give me the ball no matter what.

1164
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,090
Jae Suk. Pass it in two chances.

1165
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,160
We got this.

1166
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,280
We won.

1167
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,530
Get ready.

1168
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,930
- Pass in two chances.
- Hurry up.

1169
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,100
- Pass in two chances.
- Hurry up.

1170
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,490
The net.

1171
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,430
- The net.
- Why did you say that?

1172
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,700
- Here...
- You said the net.

1173
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,680
- Why did you say that?
- He spoke in English.

1174
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,740
Just now,

1175
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,100
Jin said "net."

1176
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,570
- He said it first.
- Okay.

1177
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,950
- Suk Jin said it first.
- No.

1178
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,140
- Suk Jin said it first.
- He said it first.

1179
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,180
- He said it first.
- It was Jin.

1180
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,620
- They both said it.
- What are you talking about?

1181
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,350
- He said it first.
- I didn't.

1182
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,910
- I heard it. He said it first.
- He said it first.

1183
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,550
- They both said it.
- They both said it.

1184
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,760
I'll give each team a point.

1185
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,120
- Okay.
- Good.

1186
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,700
- It's 10 to 7.
- No English.

1187
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,370
- No English.
- Let's go.

1188
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:30,200
- Watch your mouth.
- Se Chan just spoke English.

1189
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,530
Se Chan spoke English.

1190
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,840
- Se Chan spoke English.
- Se Chan said "okay."

1191
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,010
- Hey.
- Sorry.

1192
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,470
- Sorry. I didn't realize it.
- Did you speak English?

1193
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,510
- Sorry.
- Good.

1194
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,510
- You can't even speak English.
- What's the score?

1195
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,320
It's 10 to 8.

1196
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,370
- Ten to eight.
- Okay.

1197
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,620
- Ten to eight.
- Good.

1198
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,990
Haha said "okay."

1199
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,010
- What is wrong with you?
- This is crazy.

1200
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,160
- Get out of there.
- Haha.

1201
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,180
- Hey.
- Get out.

1202
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,320
- I can't take this anymore.
- Give me the ball.

1203
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,760
You don't even dare to speak
when you go abroad.

1204
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:01,840
- Can I switch with Se Chan?
- Yes.

1205
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,930
Let's switch later.

1206
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,030
- So Min is here.
- Haha.

1207
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,640
- Right. So Min should change.
- I'll go in then.

1208
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,510
- You may go in.
- You should move up.

1209
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,180
- Good luck.
- English...

1210
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
(Good luck.)

1211
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,970
- Let's not talk.
- Okay.

1212
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,720
- So Min said "good luck."
- Why...

1213
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,260
- So Min said "good luck."
- Why...

1214
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,490
Hey. Get lost.

1215
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,780
(They're unable to start the game.)

1216
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,220
- This is crazy.
- Why would you...

1217
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,720
Do whatever you want.

1218
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,800
- I'll bring a point.
- Go, my team.

1219
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,490
(Go, my team.)

1220
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,470
- Don't cheer.
- You said "team."

1221
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,030
(She got caught for cheering.)

1222
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,100
Don't cheer.

1223
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,910
You said "team."

1224
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,740
(Sighing)

1225
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,850
(Sorry.)

1226
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,780
- She chose another word, but...
- Don't talk.

1227
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,590
- Don't talk.
- Don't talk.

1228
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,160
Go, my colleagues.

1229
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,350
- Go, my team.
- Let's go.

1230
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,120
- Let me go. Then I won't talk.
- Go.

1231
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1232
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,720
- Let's start.
- Let me go.

1233
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,120
(Okay.)

1234
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,700
- Why do you keep...
- Don't talk for goodness' sake.

1235
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,570
- It was out of habit.
- Stop talking.

1236
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,870
- Get ready.
- Don't talk.

1237
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,930
- We can't kick the ball at all.
- Get ready.

1238
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,010
Don't talk.

1239
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,240
- Right.
- Do you want to do it?

1240
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,850
Okay.

1241
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,850
The score gap is huge.

1242
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,350
(Because Team Suk Jin took turns
to speak in English,)

1243
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,220
(the score gap is increased.)

1244
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,510
We're going to win.

1245
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,950
All right.

1246
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,990
Nice.

1247
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,430
You got it?

1248
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,320
- Hey.
- Hey.

1249
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:37,820
(Jae Suk lost a point
while trying to smash the ball.)

1250
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,820
- Good!
- Good!

1251
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,760
That was necessary.

1252
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,260
Good job.

1253
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,910
Good job, team.

1254
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:45,970
(Gasping)

1255
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,840
Good job, team.

1256
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,570
(Jin's mistake evens it out.)

1257
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,550
- Good.
- We can do it.

1258
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,850
Jin, you said "team."

1259
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,350
Okay.

1260
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,780
It's okay.

1261
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,620
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1262
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,180
- That was humane.
- I should seal my mouth.

1263
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,780
Good job, colleagues.

1264
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,030
- You're barely talking.
- Good job, colleagues.

1265
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,120
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1266
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,280
Jin, you should try.

1267
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,850
Jin, you should serve...

1268
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,260
Why don't you stand
and kick the ball?

1269
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,070
I don't think that's a good idea.

1270
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,200
- It's okay, Jin.
- Try it.

1271
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,700
- Can I do it as I want?
- Make yourself comfortable.

1272
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:19,970
Good.

1273
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,070
Right, you can do it.

1274
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,140
- You got it.
- Try it.

1275
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,050
- But...
- Make it bounce.

1276
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,180
Make it bounce and...

1277
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,640
- Try it.
- That's right.

1278
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,720
This is nice.

1279
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,050
Outside or inside?

1280
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,010
Outside or inside?

1281
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,450
(A basic question)

1282
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,090
- Outside.
- Give it a try.

1283
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,220
(The world star too busy traveling
around the world to play with balls)

1284
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,660
- Give it a try.
- He really doesn't play with balls.

1285
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,660
Good.

1286
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,660
- It doesn't matter.
- That's great.

1287
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,760
What are you playing right now?

1288
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,820
(Trying to make him speak English)

1289
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,160
(Be quiet!)

1290
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,530
(His leading question
doesn't work at all.)

1291
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,640
Send it.

1292
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,260
How should I...

1293
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,410
- Good.
- Good.

1294
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,100
(Team Suk Jin scored.)

1295
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,030
(Yes!)

1296
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,550
- Hey.
- That was nice.

1297
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:02,720
- Nice.
- Yahoo.

1298
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,740
- Yahoo.
- Yahoo.

1299
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,350
Yahoo.

1300
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,660
Don't speak.

1301
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,120
- Here I go.
- Here we go.

1302
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,720
Is it me?

1303
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:15,030
I'll do it.

1304
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:16,550
I'll do it.

1305
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,720
It went out.

1306
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,430
- It went out.
- It's okay.

1307
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,990
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

1308
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,340
- Let's go.
- My teammates, don't speak.

1309
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,800
- Right.
- Close your mouth.

1310
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,510
- Don't speak, teammates.
- Don't speak.

1311
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,910
I'll do it.

1312
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,970
- That was good.
- Attack.

1313
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:36,740
- That was good.
- Attack.

1314
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,820
(Smashing)

1315
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,890
It's mine.

1316
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,090
(Se Chan received.)

1317
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,090
(Suk Jin kicks it back.)

1318
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,410
Well done.

1319
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,780
(Nervous for the 1st time
30 minutes after it began)

1320
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,620
- Oh, gosh.
- This is nice.

1321
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,490
In the back.

1322
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:53,990
You can kick it over the net.

1323
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,200
(Jae Suk has a chance to smash it!)

1324
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,530
- Hey.
- You don't have to do that.

1325
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,240
Why are you trying to show a trick?

1326
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,300
Well done.

1327
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,430
What's this?

1328
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,100
Here we go.

1329
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,100
(Team Jin is leading with
a bigger margin thanks to that.)

1330
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,450
- It's mine.
- Yes. It's yours.

1331
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,370
- Okay, Jae Suk.
- Oh, my.

1332
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,280
What's wrong with you today?

1333
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,740
- It went out.
- Your kicks are bad.

1334
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,720
- It went out.
- It went out.

1335
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,350
I didn't kick it
as I saw that it went out.

1336
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,890
Good job.

1337
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,530
What are the scores?

1338
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,100
It's 20 to 14.

1339
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,350
- They got one point left.
- Yes.

1340
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,370
(If Team Jin scores one more time,
the game will be over.)

1341
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,430
We must win. Let's try it.

1342
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,600
One point. I'll end it.

1343
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,490
- We must win. Let's do it.
- We got this.

1344
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,570
- We'll end it like this.
- Let's focus.

1345
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,370
- Do what like this?
- We'll end it.

1346
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,300
Here I go, Suk Jin.

1347
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,640
- What?
- Are you confident?

1348
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,370
Did you say that to me?

1349
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,680
- Hey.
- Suk Jin. Him.

1350
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,910
- Suk Jin, here I go.
- This Suk Jin.

1351
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,320
- Suk Jin, I'm confident.
- "Here I go." That's for me.

1352
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,820
No. It was
"Suk Jin, are you confident?"

1353
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,120
- I'm confident.
- We got this.

1354
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,320
- I'm confident.
- Great.

1355
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,260
(Whistling)

1356
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,280
Give it to us.

1357
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,550
(Team Suk Jin earned 1 point
because of Se Chan's mistake.)

1358
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,890
- Give it to us.
- Give it to us.

1359
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,220
- It's 20 to 15.
- Suk Jin didn't answer.

1360
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,100
Let's score just five points.

1361
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,970
- Let's score just 5 points.
- Just 5 points.

1362
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:03,970
Don't speak.
If you make a mistake, it's over.

1363
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:06,470
Just one point.

1364
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:08,430
- Be quiet.
- Just one point.

1365
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:10,530
(The game to win one point
that will decide their fate)

1366
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,910
Be careful not to speak English.

1367
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,180
- Is it me?
- Yes.

1368
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:16,470
Suk Jin.

1369
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,020
(He flew!)

1370
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,920
It touched the line.

1371
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,210
(He flew powerfully, but the ball
touched the line and went out.)

1372
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,710
- We made it.
- We won.

1373
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,710
(Team Jin won.)

1374
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:40,980
- We won.
- We did it.

1375
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,040
Let's pretend that it didn't happen
to make it fun.

1376
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,440
It's not fun.

1377
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,770
It's fun.

1378
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,520
- Let's do it again to make it fun.
- It's so fun.

1379
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,850
- It was fun.
- Let it slide.

1380
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,290
The Bongsan Mask Dance was good.

1381
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,610
- It was hasty.
- Let it slide.

1382
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,690
Gosh, I'm disappointed.

1383
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,750
(It was close, but they lost it
due to English and bad kicks.)

1384
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,460
- Good.
- The winning team will pick...

1385
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,150
- an exchange ticket.
- Yes.

1386
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,770
Among 4 tickets, only 1 of them
is a real exchange ticket.

1387
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,630
Go to the booth one at a time
and draw a ticket.

1388
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:09,630
- Okay.
- The winning team only.

1389
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,060
- One at a time?
- Yes.

1390
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,810
- You go first.
- Me first? Okay.

1391
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,580
Okay. What is it?

1392
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,170
(He got a losing ticket.)

1393
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,080
Gosh.

1394
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,750
(Next is Se Chan.)

1395
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:27,750
(Dud)

1396
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,790
(He also got a losing ticket.)

1397
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,020
Hello.

1398
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,460
(Next is Jin.)

1399
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,860
(How lucky is the superstar?)

1400
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,060
(It's dud again.)

1401
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,960
Nice.

1402
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,040
- Did you get a good one?
- Yes, it's a good one.

1403
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,400
(Ji Hyo goes in a relaxed manner
at the end.)

1404
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,080
(She got an exchange ticket.)

1405
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,480
(Golden Hand Ji Hyo
gets a good one regardless.)

1406
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,190
All of you drew an exchange ticket.

1407
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:59,480
As I told you, the winning team
will get jjamppong,

1408
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,210
and the losing team
will have a lunchbox.

1409
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,480
- I want to have jjamppong too.
- Move to the next room and eat.

1410
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,100
- A lunchbox isn't bad, but...
- Okay. Jjamppong.

1411
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,790
- Jjamppong.
- Jjamppong.

1412
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,500
I'm hungry.

1413
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:11,360
It's a pity
that I can't have jjamppong.

1414
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,100
Did you already start eating?

1415
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,400
I'm just eating.

1416
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,460
(Team Suk Jin
just got simple lunchboxes.)

1417
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,940
- Did jjamppong not arrive yet?
- No.

1418
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,940
Thank you for the food.

1419
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,610
- I want to have jjamppong.
- Jjamppong must be good.

1420
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,750
As I told you, only the winning team
will get jjamppong.

1421
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,210
Please serve it.

1422
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,380
That jjamppong.

1423
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,580
The jjamppong is...

1424
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,190
Look at this. Isn't it amazing?

1425
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,420
This is incredible.

1426
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,730
- Can we have more chopsticks?
- The broth must be so good.

1427
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,520
- We got ones here.
- We got them.

1428
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,290
- Isn't it amazing?
- This is incredible.

1429
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,400
(A table full of Chinese food)

1430
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,690
- It looks delicious.
- Yes.

1431
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,360
It can't be bad with the broth.

1432
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,360
- It's...
- It looks delicious.

1433
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,900
It has arrived just now.

1434
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,130
My goodness.

1435
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,580
Gosh, this is...

1436
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,270
Suk Jin...

1437
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:56,380
(At that moment)

1438
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,380
Suk Jin used an exchange ticket
to switch with Jin.

1439
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,440
- What?
- He switched with who?

1440
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,960
(From the beginning
when the jjamppong was served,)

1441
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,290
(Seok Sam couldn't take his eyes
off of it.)

1442
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,250
(He got up in the end.)

1443
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,690
Excuse me.
I'd like to switch with Jin.

1444
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,020
I want to have jjamppong.

1445
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
(Bewitched by the smell
of jjamppong, he used the ticket.)

1446
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,270
Suk Jin used an exchange ticket...

1447
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,040
- Gosh.
- to switch with Jin.

1448
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,880
- What?
- He switched with who?

1449
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,000
- Isn't this crossing a line?
- With Jin?

1450
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,170
- Jin, the lunchbox looks good.
- Why Jin?

1451
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,750
- What?
- You should've picked another one.

1452
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,650
- Why?
- Why do you not let him eat?

1453
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:38,150
Suk Jin, stand still here.
I'll switch and come back.

1454
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:40,960
- Stand still here.
- What are you talking about?

1455
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,750
- Don't sit.
- Why?

1456
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,250
- I'll switch too.
- He's so...

1457
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,560
He should've switched
with another person.

1458
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,650
- Why Jin?
- You should've chosen Se Chan.

1459
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,830
- Pick Se Chan, not Jin.
- Right.

1460
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,130
Why are you saying that?

1461
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,900
So that you can eat there.

1462
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,400
- I mean... Hey.
- Is he dumb?

1463
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:58,500
I'll switch with Suk Jin.

1464
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,710
(Bewitched by jjamppong, he didn't
think about what would happen next.)

1465
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:04,170
- Jin will switch again.
- Right. My goodness.

1466
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,270
He switched again,
so it's back to the original state.

1467
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,920
- I'm sorry.
- He's so...

1468
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,980
- I only got cursed.
- Jin got an exchange ticket.

1469
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,920
- I'm sorry. I have to eat too.
- Right.

1470
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,460
That's true.

1471
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,480
- Suk Jin.
- Eat your food.

1472
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,650
Why did he do that?

1473
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,330
You're a fool, Suk Jin.

1474
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,020
(Team Jin starts eating jjamppong
elegantly.)

1475
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,290
Thank you for the food.

1476
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,960
Jin is doing an eating show.

1477
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,480
Jin, eat a lot.

1478
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,210
Can we use the exchange ticket
until the end?

1479
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,750
What are you doing, Jae Suk?

1480
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,520
- What?
- I'm going to eat here.

1481
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,770
(The jjamppong hunter squeezes
himself between them.)

1482
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,880
The jjamppong does look good though.

1483
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,080
Eat this.

1484
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,310
- Can I?
- No.

1485
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,790
Are we allowed to give them
pickled radish?

1486
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,020
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

1487
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,500
I'm not eating pickled radish.

1488
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,690
How about onion?

1489
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,270
- Onion?
- How about chunjang?

1490
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,690
You're quite a prankster too.

1491
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,360
He's very playful.

1492
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm in charge of that in our group.

1493
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,310
He's very playful.

1494
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,730
Suk Jin, do you want some too?

1495
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,110
Is this squid?

1496
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:08,210
- Hey, it's onion.
- I'm sorry. I thought it was squid.

1497
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,310
It's onion, not squid.

1498
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:13,080
There are circles and stuff.
I think we should guess something.

1499
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,310
I think it's a quiz.

1500
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,190
Suk Jin, are you good at quizzes?

1501
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,610
I know a lot of common knowledge.

1502
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,960
(Confidence)

1503
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,020
- Do you?
- Are you sure?

1504
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,230
For real.

1505
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,230
Suk Jin, I'm so curious.

1506
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:29,790
During the world tour,
you meet international superstars.

1507
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:30,790
- Yes.
- Right.

1508
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,190
I'm so jealous.

1509
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,130
I thought
you were asking a question.

1510
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,560
- It wasn't a question.
- You said you would ask something.

1511
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,170
- Wasn't he going to ask something?
- Suk Jin.

1512
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,330
I'm jealous.

1513
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,080
Who were you fascinated by the most?

1514
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,810
Suk Jin.

1515
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,400
Famous celebrities would come
and ask for a photo, right?

1516
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,420
- Who was it?
- Who? Tell us.

1517
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,520
- Someone who is famous in Korea.
- Who is it?

1518
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,540
In Korea?

1519
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,580
- From another country.
- From another country.

1520
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,650
- I can't remember the name.
- He's forgetful.

1521
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:57,830
He has common knowledge,
but he's forgetful.

1522
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:58,830
An actor or a singer?

1523
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,360
What's the matter with you?

1524
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,130

- It's not him.
- Snoop Dogg.

1532
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,170
No.

1533
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,310
What's his hit song?

1534
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,150
What kind of songs did he release?
Rap songs?

- He does soul music.

1536
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,310

00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,310
- Anderson .Paak.
- No.

1541
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,860
This happened years ago.

1542
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,520
- Is he a singer from the past?
- Usher.

1543
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,230
- Usher?
- It isn't Usher.

1544
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,860
- Hold on.
- Nelly.

1545
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,630
I might not know
even if I hear the name.

1546
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,690
How many years ago was this?

1547
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:39,290
- About three years ago.

- Three years ago.
- Chris Brown.

1549
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:44,110
No. It has been a few years
since his song became a hit...

1550
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,210
- in Korea.
- Really?

1551
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,580
(Clue: He is famous
in Korea as well.)

1552
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,900
I know who he is.

1553
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,850
I don't know. I was too focused.

1554
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:51,850
(I don't know. I was too focused.)

1555
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,020
Who was it?
Let me go and hear his name.

1556
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,940
- John Legend.
- Let me go and hear his name.

1557
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,110
I know John Legend.

1558
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,650
- John Legend.
- I knew it.

1559
00:53:58,650 --> 00:53:59,650
- John Legend.
- John Legend.

1560
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,020
(The answer is John Legend.)

1561
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,130
- John Legend.
- John Legend.

1562
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,650
(John Legend!)

1563
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,270
- John Legend.
- I love John Legend.

1564
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:13,040
- John Legend.
- I said it.

1565
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:16,610
(The man who answered correctly
wants to be praised.)

1566
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,830
- John Legend.
- I love John Legend.

1567
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:21,900
- John Legend.

1568
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,400
- John Legend.
- That's right.

1569
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,650
- I know who he is.
- That's right.

1570
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,770
- John Legend.
- So it was John Legend.

1571
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,420
- Go on.
- What happened?

1572
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,940
We went
to John Legend's waiting room...

1573
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,420
- to say hello.
- Okay.

1574
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,330
He suddenly took out our album
from his backpack.

1575
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:37,750
- Really? Did he do that?
- BTS' album.

1576
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,250
He said his relative is a fan
and asked for our autographs.

1577
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:41,750
John Legend.

1578
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,960
- No way.
- That's incredible.

1579
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,460
The Beatles?

1580
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,600
(The Beatles?)

1581
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,500
That's right. He is a member
of The Beatles.

1582
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,610
- Isn't he a member of The Beatles?
- Really?

1583
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:54,630
- What are you talking about?
- BTS' album.

1584
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,080
Is that John Lennon?

1585
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:00,650
Have you ever been invited
to someone's house? A home party.

1586
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,540
- A famous celebrity.
- What kind of a question is that?

1587
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,690
That's the worst question.

1588
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:06,790
- A home party?
- Hurry up and tell us.

1589
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:08,690
- I did get invited.
- Like a house with a pool.

1590
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:10,330
I did get invited, but I didn't go.

1591
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,420
- Why not?
- Who was it? Who invited you?

1592
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,020
I don't remember.

1593
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,130
- Tell us.
- Let's guess who it is.

1594
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:17,270
- Who is it?
- Let's guess.

1595
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,100
- Was it a man or a woman?
- Tell us.

1596
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,560
- Tell us.
- He doesn't have good memory.

1597
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,790
Jin, tell us.

1598
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,210
Have you been on a yacht?

1599
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:25,110
- A yacht?
- "Have you been on a yacht?"

1600
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:27,110
- Yes, I have.
- I have been on a yacht too.

1601
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:28,750
We have been on a yacht for a show.

1602
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,770
- I mean... A yacht party.
- A yacht party.

1603
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,670
I haven't been to a party.

1604
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,880
I guess he doesn't party much.

1605
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,850
Jin is very...

1606
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,150
- He is down-to-earth.
- He is down-to-earth.

1607
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,020
Aren't you an I type?

1608
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,020
- E?
- INTP.

1609
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,690
See? I can recognize
a fellow I type.

1610
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,730
- Are you an I type?
- It's ISFP.

1611
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:47,520
- No way.
- You are a fellow I type.

1612
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,230
Jae Suk is an ugly I type
and Jin is a handsome I type.

1613
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,560
Jin, my MBTI type is INFP.

1614
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,400
INFP? We are friends.

1615
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,630
Jin, I am an I type too.

1616
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,210
- Same here.
- IN.

1617
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,400
(Haha, an E type)

1618
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,380
- Why?
- An immature I type.

1619
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,000
Why are all these celebrities
an I type?

1620
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,400
- He is an E type.
- Are you an E type?

1621
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,040
- An ugly I type, a handsome I type.
- Are you an E type?

1622
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,750
- I am an E type.
- I see.

1623
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,770
- I am an E type.
- Then you are an old E type.

1624
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:08,810
(Then you are an old E type.)

1625
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:12,190
He is an old E type.

1626
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,610
- An ugly I type, a handsome I type.
- I.

1627
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:15,860
- An old E type.
- An old E type.

1628
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,420
- An old E type.
- A short I type.

1629
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,790
- He loves it.
- A short E type.

1630
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,290
- He is a short E type.
- A young E type.

1631
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,900
- A short E type.
- I am a young E type.

1632
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,100
A short E type.

1633
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,290
I want to hear more from Jin.

1634
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,400
- Let's keep going.
- What do you want to know?

1635
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,900
- Ask me anything. Ask me.
- That's right.

1636
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,670
- Will you tell us all?
- I will tell you what I know.

1637
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,500
- He doesn't know much.
- You don't remember.

1638
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,880
- He doesn't know much.
- I can do it.

1639
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,940
- Can you do it?
- I will tell you what I know.

1640
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,750
- He doesn't know much.
- Really?

1641
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,770
Let's say you are giving
a performance.

1642
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,110
- Hey.
- Famous celebrities...

1643
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,520
Jin, what kind of food
do you get on a private jet?

1644
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,380
- Hey.
- Famous celebrities...

1645
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,730
Jin, what kind of food
do you get on a private jet?

1646
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,290
I was asking a question diligently.

1647
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,060
I can't believe she interned it.

1648
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,920
What was that?
"I can't believe she interned it."

1649
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,520
I can't believe she intercepted it.

1650
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,460
He couldn't pronounce "Intercept."

1651
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,310
Let's say you take the stage
at an award ceremony.

1652
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,310
- Stop already.
- Did other nominees...

1653
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,580
ever glare at you?

1654
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:08,310
They usually don't glare.

1655
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,900
Maybe they got jealous.

1656
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,000
Did they ever do that?

1657
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,020
This is a miraculous moment.

1658
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,110
- I can't believe the fact...
- This is impressive.

1659
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,940
- that Jin is here with us.
- You know,

1660
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,710
both BTS and Running Man
are incredible.

1661
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,330
That's right. Hey, Hyung In.

1662
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,420
Give him 50 more dollars
for this week's episode.

1663
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,650
(Give him 50 more dollars
for this week's episode.)

1664
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,130
- Give him 50 more dollars.
- Deduct the money from his share.

1665
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,670
- Don't be like that.
- Deduct the money from his share.

1666
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,290
- Hyung In is okay with that.
- Deduct the money from my share.

1667
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:33,000
- Give him 50 more dollars.
- Deduct the money from his share.

1668
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,290
- Hey. Use it to buy jjamppong.
- In that case...

1669
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,210
Then Suk Jin will only get
150 dollars this month.

1670
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:41,040
- How will you get by?
- It's okay.

1671
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,880
- Hey.
- Give Jin more money.

1672
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,380
I will give you
a quarter of my share.

1673
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,810
Were you getting 200 dollars?

1674
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:48,110
Yes. They say
they will give me a raise.

1675
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,520
My heart aches.

1676
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:50,850
- It's okay.
- He is getting a lot.

1677
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:51,940
He enjoys working.

1678
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,480
- It's better than staying at home.
- That's right.

1679
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,520
What's the use of being idle?

1680
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,290
- What's the use of being idle?
- It's better to come here...

1681
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:58,690
- and get paid.
- You are right.

1682
00:57:58,690 --> 00:57:59,750
I am so proud.

1683
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,790
- Jin is here with us.
- He is cool.

1684
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:02,920
He is lovely.

1685
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:04,500
- You are incredible.
- Seriously.

1686
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,190
- You are my hero.
- BTS is the best.

1687
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,860
- Do you know how nice Jin is?
- That's right.

1688
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,460
- Jin...
- Suk Jin, stop it already.

1689
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,480
Jin... I am a witness.

1690
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,480
Jin...

1691
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,310
Suk Jin, I want to play games now.

1692
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:17,580
- Okay.
- If that's what you want, okay.

1693
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,670
That was neat.

1694
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,210
During the next mission,
things will get heated up.

1695
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:25,150
It's "No, It's Fire."

1696
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,420
- All right.
- The first player...

1697
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,230
will pick a member
of the opposing team...

1698
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,730
and attack with words
he or she can't accept easily.

1699
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,790
The attacked member
will say, "No..."

1700
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:38,670
and use words and actions
to dispute the claim.

1701
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:41,830
Then he or she will attack
a member of the opposing team.

1702
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,500
If the defending member
can't think of a reason...

1703
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,110
or say something unreasonable,
it will be minus one point.

1704
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,630
If the attacking member
misses the timing...

1705
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:51,710
or fails to say something,
it will be minus one point.

1706
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,210
If you can't accept my call,

1707
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:57,290
these three production crew members
will decide.

1708
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,650
- Okay.
- We just need to say, "No."

1709
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,520
We need to dispute
the words blindly.

1710
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,480
- "You are handsome." "No."
- "No."

1711
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,690
- We can attack that way.
- "You are handsome."

1712
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:08,230
- "No."
- "I am ugly."

1713
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,330
- "I am ugly." That's how you play.
- If you can dance well...

1714
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,400
Who says "No."

1715
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,500
- No.
- No.

1716
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,670
- No.
- I say that often.

1717
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,400
That's annoying. That's so annoying.

1718
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,670
- No. I say, "No."
- No.

1719
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,000
- What?
- He will switch places.

1720
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,250
- He will use a ticket.
- With whom will he do that?

1721
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,170
- "No. I am ugly."
- He will use a ticket.

1722
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,920
With Suk Jin,

1723
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,290
I will change places.

1724
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,210
- Did he change places?
- He will join this team.

1725
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:36,480
- He changes places.
- With whom did he do that?

1726
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,790
Jin used an exchange ticket.

1727
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,630
He changed places with Suk Jin.

1728
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:43,670
(He changed places with Suk Jin.)

1729
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:47,500
(The two captains change places.)

1730
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,460
(Jin leaves for the members
with a way with words.)

1731
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,900
Come back later.

1732
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,770
Jin, you should experience
that kind of team.

1733
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:55,500
- That's right.
- You should experience it.

1734
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Join that team.

1735
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,940
I can't attack the older members.

1736
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:00,310
- Okay.
- He is wise.

1737
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:01,610
- Good call.
- I am the oldest member.

1738
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:02,710
You are right.

1739
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:06,150
- How strange.
- Jin made the perfect call.

1740
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,690
- Yes. It's fun to tease Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin is...

1741
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,290
- the perfect target.
- Yes.

1742
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:10,880
Jin, get changed.

1743
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,460
You knew that they attack me a lot.

1744
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,150
All right.

1745
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:16,500
(Haha approaches him.)

1746
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,360
Thank you, Haha.

1747
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,330
You are wild.

1748
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,310
- Hey.
- What?

1749
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:24,310
Give it here.

1750
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:27,500
(He gets apprehended
for stealing a uniform.)

1751
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,380
- You caught me.
- Hey.

1752
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,500
I am sorry, Jae Suk.

1753
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,500
This will be the dance.

1754
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,150
- No.
- No.

1755
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,690
We should do this instead.
Let's begin.

1756
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:41,290
- No.
- No.

1757
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:42,420
- No.
- It looks strange.

1758
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,960
- It's too complex.
- Will you do this?

1759
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,060
- We will do this.
- We will do this.

1760
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,690
- Isn't this too complex?
- How about this?

1761
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,330
No.

1762
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:50,860
- I love it.
- Hey.

1763
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,360
- I love it.
- No.

1764
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,940
- No.
- No.

1765
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,630
- No.
- It's the "Fire" dance.

1766
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,880
- "Fire."
- Jin, show us the dance.

1767
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,770
Show us the original dance.

1768
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:03,500
I want to go back to that team.

1769
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,150
- Don't do that.
- You feel uncomfortable, right?

1770
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:07,040
- Come here.
- They don't stay still.

1771
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,150
- Give it a go.
- They don't stay still.

1772
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,790
- No.
- No.

1773
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:13,150
I want to go back to that team.

1774
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:14,310
- It's nice.
- Come here.

1775
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:16,580
- It's nice.
- You don't have a ticket anymore.

1776
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:18,230
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

1777
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,600
- No.
- No.

1778
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,020
Jae Suk, you like BTS.

1779
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,190
I love the group so much.

1780
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:26,270
- Fire
- You should say, "No."

1781
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,600
I love the group so much.

1782
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Fire

1783
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,270
- You should say, "No."
- "No."

1784
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,210
(You should say, "No.")

1785
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,310
- Is he a fool?
- He is intimidated.

1786
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:40,020
(He was so nervous
that he forgot the basic rules.)

1787
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:43,310
(The teammates give Jin a headache
in different ways.)

1788
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:44,850
You should say, "No."

1789
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:46,110
- What was that?
- You must have been scared.

1790
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:47,790
- He couldn't say, "No."
- Do I say, "No?"

1791
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:49,230
- "No."
- "No."

1792
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,150
- That's the game.
- Okay.

1793
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,150
- Okay.
- Right.

1794
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:53,650
- That's how you play the game.
- I get it now.

1795
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:56,290
I get it now.
That's how you play the game.

1796
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:58,290
That's how things go.
You didn't know, did you?

1797
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:00,770
- No.
- No.

1798
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:03,270
So Min, you don't have a boyfriend.

1799
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,000
- Say that you have one.
- No. I have one.

1800
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,000
- Who is he?
- He is over there.

1801
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,810
- No. I am not her boyfriend.
- No.

1802
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:12,110
- He is over there.
- No. I am not her boyfriend.

1803
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:14,310
- No.
- No.

1804
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:16,040
Yes. You are her boyfriend.

1805
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,610
- I am not her boyfriend.
- No.

1806
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,880
Behind the set,
you guys held hands earlier.

1807
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,020
- No.
- You guys held hands earlier.

1808
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,060
- No.
- My goodness.

1809
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,580
- Yes.
- Don't lie. We didn't hold hands.

1810
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,600
- Your fingers were intertwined.
- We didn't hold hands.

1811
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,420
Se Chan, you hate me, right?

1812
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,270
No. I like you so much.
Here is a heart.

1813
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,830
No. I like you so much.

1814
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:37,670
(Catfish's careless confession
annoys her.)

1815
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,810
(That's so funny.)

1816
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:40,940
That's strange.

1817
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,210
- That's no fun. I don't like it.
- No.

1818
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:45,310
- No.
- I am her boyfriend today.

1819
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:47,880
- No.
- He is your boyfriend today.

1820
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,020
No, he isn't.

1821
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,610
He is her boyfriend today.

1822
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:53,380
- No.
- No.

1823
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,580
Haha, you like BTS, right?

1824
01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:00,290
(Haha, you like BTS, right?)

1825
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,020
(No.)

1826
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,500
It's okay.

1827
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,630
- Hey.
- Just say it.

1828
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:07,900
(He can't bring himself to say no.)

1829
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,500
- Hey.
- Just say it. It's a game.

1830
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,900
It's a game.

1831
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,110
Just say, "No."

1832
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:13,380
Are you going to be like that?

1833
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,380
Let's go.

1834
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,580
Let's begin.

1835
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,980
- No.
- No.

1836
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,350
Suk Jin, you are handsome, right?

1837
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,770
No. I am really ugly.

1838
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,110
(He makes an effort.)

1839
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:27,310
- He looks cute.
- He looks cute.

1840
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:28,520
Shouldn't you deduct a point?

1841
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,580
It should still count.

1842
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,080
- No.
- No.

1843
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,250
Jong Kook,

1844
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:35,400
you like to work out, right?

1845
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:38,020
No.

1846
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,360
I like to lie down all the time.

1847
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,690
I can even lie down right now.

1848
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,110
(Lying down)

1849
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,670
(The pose doesn't suit
Jong Kook at all.)

1850
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:47,400
He doesn't like to work out.

1851
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,850
No.

1852
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:53,420
So Min, your bangs are
very pretty, right?

1853
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,440
No. They aren't pretty at all.

1854
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,850
They make me look like Yeong Goo.

1855
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,860
- No.
- No.

1856
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,690
Jong Kook, you are good
at soccer, right?

1857
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:02,880
You are good at soccer, right?

1858
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,960
No.

1859
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,020
I have lousy feet.

1860
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,730
No. I have lousy feet.

1861
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:12,170
(The lousy feet performance)

1862
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:13,770
(He disputed Haha's words easily.)

1863
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,060
- No.
- No.

1864
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:18,330
Jin, you like
the leader of BTS, RM, right?

1865
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:20,810
No.

1866
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:22,770
I am pretty sure I dislike him.

1867
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,670
How is he so smart?

1868
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:25,850
He is annoying.

1869
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,980
- That was nice.
- That was nice.

1870
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,350
- That was nice. Good job.
- Okay. It's only a game.

1871
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:32,860
- That was nice.
- That was nice.

1872
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,190
I don't need to apologize, right?

1873
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,230
- Of course not.
- Of course not. It's only a game.

1874
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,860
- No.
- No.

1875
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,400
Suk Jin, are you 40 years old now?

1876
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:45,190
No.

1877
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:46,670
I will turn 60 next year.

1878
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,960
(I will turn 60 next year.)

1879
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,940
- I actually won't turn 60.
- You need to show an action.

1880
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,170
- "I will turn 60 next year."
- Good job.

1881
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:54,480
- Come to think of it,
- You need to show an action.

1882
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,210
I actually won't turn 60.

1883
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:57,440
- Seriously.
- You are close...

1884
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,040
- to that age.
- No.

1885
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:01,750
That was nice. Let's begin.

1886
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:04,190
- No.
- No.

1887
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:07,080
Jae Suk, you think
you are really handsome, right?

1888
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:11,250
- No. I am totally ugly.
- That counts.

1889
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,500
- I agree.
- I agree.

1890
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,100
(His very existence
quickly convinces everyone.)

1891
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,130
- It's true.
- I agree.

1892
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,940
- You shouldn't get angry.
- This is only a game.

1893
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:21,540
- Correct.
- I shouldn't get angry.

1894
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,770
- It's true.
- There is no need to get angry.

1895
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:26,170
- No.
- No.

1896
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:29,380
Se Chan, you think
you are uglier than me, right?

1897
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,110
No.

1898
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,710
- I am handsome.
- Let's see.

1899
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:34,920
- Why?
- Why?

1900
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,310
- I am handsome.
- Let's see.

1901
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,210
- Why?
- Why?

1902
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,250
- Why? It's up to him.
- I have...

1903
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:42,310
- I have my own preference.
- Hey.

1904
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,790
- He has unique charms.
- I am handsome.

1905
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:46,400
- Hey.
- My jaw is pretty.

1906
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,650
- It's rare among comedians.
- It was ridiculous.

1907
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:51,170
All three judges held up the X sign.

1908
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,130
- Okay.
- Okay.

1909
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:54,600
(Team Suk Jin lost 1 point.)

1910
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,810
- No.
- No.

1911
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,580
- We can go slow.
- Ji Hyo,

1912
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,310
you don't like Jong Kook, do you?

1913
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,000
No.

1914
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,580
I really love Jong Kook.

1915
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,040
What?

1916
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:12,790
No. I really love Jong Kook.

1917
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:14,960
- What?
- My goodness.

1918
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:16,290
It's love.

1919
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:18,360
- It's real.
- Accept it.

1920
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,900
- What was that?
- It's true love.

1921
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,920
(They never expected to see
such a fun sight.)

1922
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,400
(Truly happy)

1923
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,100
- What was that?
- It's true love.

1924
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,900
- It's love.
- It's a game.

1925
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,000
- Gosh.
- It's a game.

1926
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,170
- Accept it.
- You did something similar.

1927
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,170
Accept it.

1928
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,270
She went overboard.

1929
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:38,580
(Glaring)

1930
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,520
- My stomach hurts.
- No.

1931
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,710
- No.
- No.

1932
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,610
Haha, you are happily married,
right?

1933
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,420
No.

1934
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,190
- Why?
- Aren't you happy?

1935
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:48,790
- Why?
- At times, I want to take off.

1936
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:50,460
(At times, I want to take off.)

1937
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:51,880
That counts.

1938
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,060
- That counts.
- I want to take off.

1939
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:55,000
Both Jae Suk and Suk Jin
said that.

1940
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,290
So we decided to take a trip
by ourselves next month.

1941
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:59,560
- No.
- No.

1942
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,500
- I won't go!
- He says he won't go.

1943
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,730
- I will stay at home!
- He suggested the trip.

1944
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:05,360
- I hate traveling the most.
- He suggested the trip.

1945
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:07,480
- No!
- I heard it.

1946
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,270
I hate traveling so much.

1947
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,380
(Team Jin resumes.)

1948
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,400
That was funny.

1949
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,770
- No.
- No.

1950
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,110
Suk Jin,

1951
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:20,420
you want to continue being
a member of Running Man, right?

1952
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,290
(You want to continue being
a member of Running Man, right?)

1953
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:24,080
- No.
- Good job.

1954
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:27,250
Next week's shoot will be my last.

1955
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,790
Bye, everyone.

1956
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,960
(He gets caught up
and says goodbye.)

1957
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,600
Is that why we are doing this today?

1958
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,770
Hey.

1959
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:36,900
(He announced
that he will leave the show.)

1960
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,380
- I see.
- Suk Jin, this isn't real.

1961
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,270
- I see.
- I see. That's very nice.

1962
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,440
(The game ends with Suk Jin's
shocking announcement.)

1963
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,710
- Okay.
- It's minus 4 to minus 6.

1964
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:48,350
- Team Jin won.
- Okay.

1965
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:51,080
You are the fairy of victory.

1966
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,310
My team always wins.

1967
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,750
- You are the fairy of victory.
- Yes.

1968
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,830
- You are the fairy of victory.
- You need more exchange tickets,

1969
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:59,250
- so the winning team will get two.
- Okay.

1970
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,400
The losing team will get one.

1971
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,420
Let's go first.

1972
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:04,060
(One member of Team Suk Jin
will get an exchange ticket.)

1973
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,330
Will we get one?

1974
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:07,400
I might get it.

1975
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,960
- Please take turns to pick one.
- Is it random?

1976
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,630
(Two members of Team Jin
will get an exchange ticket.)

1977
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:15,940
You should save up
on the exchange tickets.

1978
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:18,080
Okay. The floor is slippery.

1979
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,250
Is it soap water?

1980
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,110
I guess...

1981
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:23,580
we need to do something fast
when the pirate pops out.

1982
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,610
Good.

1983
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:27,520
I think someone wore
the socks I took off.

1984
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:28,920
Who did that?

1985
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,290
- The socks I took off...
- Se Chan...

1986
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:34,360
Se Chan did it because he likes you.

1987
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:35,920
I like you.

1988
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,570
- I only have eyes for you
- Stop it.

1989
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:41,960
- So Min.
- I only have eyes for you

1990
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,460
Stop it.

1991
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:45,910
- So Min's socks.
- So Min looks happy.

1992
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,370
Did you take my socks?

1993
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:48,740
Where did my socks go?

1994
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:51,610
I only have eyes for you

1995
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:52,780
I am sorry.

1996
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,950
Jin, come here.

1997
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:55,740
- I am sorry.
- Why would you be sorry?

1998
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,380
- Don't be sorry.
- Why would you be sorry?

1999
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:00,020
- We are the ones who came early.
- That's right. We came early.

2000
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,060
I won't sit still
if you say that again.

2001
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,490
Why did everyone come early...

2002
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:05,420
- and make him feel uncomfortable?
- Seriously.

2003
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:06,950
- Sit down.
- You are right.

2004
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,250
- Why did everyone come early?
- Seriously.

2005
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,960
You are right.
Why did everyone come early?

2006
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,440
- Seriously.
- That's right.

2007
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,630
We came early
for some strange reason.

2008
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:17,110
- Go along with us like that.
- That's right.

2009
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:18,660
- Okay.
- Go along with us like that.

2010
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,200
- You are right.
- We shouldn't have come early.

2011
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,570
I didn't do anything wrong.

2012
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:23,810
- Of course not.
- It's true. Don't be sorry.

2013
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,280
He is so nice.
He didn't do anything wrong.

2014
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:29,370
Both Team Suk Jin and Team Jin
lost once.

2015
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:32,320
Both teams have three penalty balls.

2016
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,250
- Okay.
- This is the last mission.

2017
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,860
This time, only the losing team...

2018
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:38,280
- will get three penalty balls.
- Okay.

2019
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:42,820
For the last mission, you must move
like an astronaut in space.

2020
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:45,030
It's the Astronaut on Soap Water.

2021
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:46,030
(Astronaut on Soap Water)

2022
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,160
What is she saying?

2023
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,440
(What is she saying?)

2024
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:50,500
Two members of each team
will enter each round.

2025
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,940
All members will be connected
by their waists.

2026
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:55,570
Acquire the pirate roulette knives
in the balloons...

2027
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:58,480
and stick them
in your team's pirate roulette.

2028
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,370
Your team wins
if the pirate pops out first.

2029
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:02,910
- I see.
- Okay.

2030
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:04,450
- We will win.
- It needs to pop out first.

2031
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,820
- We have an advantage.
- We have an advantage.

2032
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,820
We have you, Jae Suk.

2033
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,620
- Win 2 rounds for victory. Yes.
- Did you say 2 rounds?

2034
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:10,990
For fairness,

2035
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:14,250
the players will be decided
by the opposing team.

2036
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:16,270
- How will we do this?
- So Min will surely get included.

2037
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:18,660
- Yesterday, I did it at home.
- Do you pop the balloons?

2038
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,740
- The pirate popped out quickly.
- The pirate roulette?

2039
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:21,900
- Yes.
- You pop the balloons.

2040
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,240
How do you do it?

2041
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,660
- It just pops out.
- You just need to be unlucky.

2042
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:27,130
You just need to be unlucky like me.

2043
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:28,740
Do you try
the pirate roulette at home?

2044
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:29,950
- Seriously.
- I have it at home.

2045
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:31,540
He practices at home.

2046
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,170
Firstly, please choose...

2047
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:36,190
the members of the opposing team
who will enter the first round.

2048
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,350
Suk Jin.

2049
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:38,820
So you want to win this round.

2050
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:40,450
No. Don't say that.

2051
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:41,520
- You are good.
- You are good.

2052
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,060
That's right. You might win.

2053
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,860
- That's right.
- The two who didn't get picked...

2054
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,820
this time will enter the next round,

2055
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:49,120
- so try to balance things out.
- We will do that. Okay.

2056
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,570
- Let's pick Suk Jin and Jong Kook.
- Okay.

2057
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:53,330
- Suk Jin and me? Okay.
- Yes.

2058
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:54,960
- It will be fun.
- Okay.

2059
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,940
Shall we make it a match
between the two Suk Jins?

2060
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,370
- Jin versus Jin.
- Jin.

2061
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:00,130
- Jin.
- How about Jin and Jae Suk?

2062
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,200
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2063
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,950
- Okay.
- Come on out.

2064
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,150
Let's go. You need to win, okay?

2065
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,980
Let's do this.

2066
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,150
- Good luck.
- Yes.

2067
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:10,120
- Jin, let's go.
- Let's go.

2068
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,380
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2069
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,490
- Let's go.
- Ji Suk Jin!

2070
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:15,080
- Ji Suk Jin!
- Okay.

2071
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,420
Kim Suk Jin!

2072
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,120
- Kim Suk Jin!
- Let's go.

2073
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:21,200
- The best Suk Jin, Ji Suk Jin.
- The Gwangsan Kim Clan.

2074
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,160
(The game starts.)

2075
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,490
- This is hard.
- What are you doing?

2076
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:31,700
(Trainer Kim easily acquires
a balloon.)

2077
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,870
Hey, come here.

2078
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,200
Hurry up.

2079
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:37,480
Jin, I love the slapstick comedy.

2080
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,350
(Jin shows slapstick comedy first.)

2081
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,520
- This is hard.
- What are you doing?

2082
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,410
They are outmatched.

2083
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,450
- Go over there.
- Hurry up.

2084
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,320
- Hey, hurry up.
- Jin.

2085
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,880
(It's a one-sided match.)

2086
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,660
Suk Jin, get the other balloon.

2087
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,950
(Jong Kook goes
for the yellow balloon.)

2088
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,450
Get the other balloon.
Hurry up and grab it.

2089
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,730
- Come here.
- Grab it.

2090
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,900
- Where did it go?
- It's here.

2091
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,440
- Grab it.
- Hurry up.

2092
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:03,910
Jin.

2093
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:05,240
(Growling)

2094
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,700
(With a scary facial expression,
he pushes in the first knife.)

2095
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,650
Did you do it? Hurry up.

2096
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,820
Jae Suk, hurry up and pull it.

2097
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:17,120
What's this?

2098
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:19,120
Hurry up and go.

2099
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,780
(Jumping)

2100
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,780
(Giggling)

2101
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:26,290
Jin is enjoying this.

2102
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,290
Jin, go!

2103
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:29,530
Go!

2104
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,770
(Slipping)

2105
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,740
- What's this?
- They are no match.

2106
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:39,330
(Kim Suk Jin is
the same as Ji Suk Jin.)

2107
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:41,830
- He is like a paper doll.
- They are no match.

2108
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,170
- Suk Jin.
- Grab this.

2109
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,910
- Why? Is it ours?
- Yes.

2110
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,040
(Screaming)

2111
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:55,520
(Everyone gets pulled
in Jong Kook's direction.)

2112
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:56,780
Is this ours?

2113
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:00,600
(The paper doll is busy
falling down.)

2114
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,120
(Meanwhile, Team Suk Jin
gets more knives.)

2115
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,740
It's here.

2116
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:10,410
What?

2117
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:14,330
(Dizzy)

2118
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:18,280
(Horrendous)

2119
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:22,570
(He doesn't care.)

2120
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:25,820
(Running with knees)

2121
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,660
(While Jae Suk's balloon
is in danger,)

2122
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:35,530
(Jong Kook tries again.)

2123
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,310
Gosh, why is it not working?

2124
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,460
(He stuck many swords,
but the pirate won't come out.)

2125
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,530
Where are they?

2126
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:50,170
- Where are they?
- I got them. I saw them.

2127
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:51,670
(Jin found many swords
at that moment.)

2128
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:53,650
Jae Suk, there's a lot here.

2129
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:54,870
- Suk Jin.
- There's a lot here.

2130
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,070
- Give them to me.
- Where are they?

2131
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,080
- Where are they?
- There you go.

2132
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,120
There's a lot here.

2133
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,190
(Jin still stuck one sword.)

2134
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,230
Suk Jin.

2135
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,570
Hey. Suk Jin.

2136
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:11,620
(Jong Kook got more swords.)

2137
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,660
I trust my luck.

2138
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:15,270
(On the other hand,
Jae Suk hasn't stuck anything yet.)

2139
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:19,270
Why does it not burst?

2140
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:23,200
Why does it not burst?

2141
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,700
(It's about time
for it to come out.)

2142
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:31,580
(It's already the 10th sword.)

2143
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:32,950
The other side.

2144
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:35,380
(Will it come out this time?)

2145
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,620
Here.

2146
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:40,660
Give it to me.

2147
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,120
(Jae Suk can reach
the pirate for now.)

2148
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,200
- Jae Suk.
- This is crazy.

2149
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,030
Come out.
I hope Jae Suk's come out.

2150
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,500
Ours won't come out.

2151
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:54,630
(Both teams need more swords.)

2152
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,780
It's here.

2153
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:00,670
It's here.

2154
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:03,070
(He took all of them.)

2155
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,580
Jae Suk, I took everything.

2156
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,950
Where are they?

2157
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,730
Suk Jin.

2158
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,400
- Do you have more?
- Two. On the other side.

2159
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,990
- Hurry and stick it.
- The other side.

2160
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:16,400
Here.

2161
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,600
Jae Suk can do it.

2162
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:20,570
- Hurry and stick it.
- The other side.

2163
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:22,740
We'll win if we just do this.

2164
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:28,070
(Did it really pop up?)

2165
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,070
Did it come out?

2166
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:30,870
We'll win if we just do this.

2167
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,320
(He got it.)

2168
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,410
- We won.
- Did it come out?

2169
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:35,780
We won.

2170
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,360
- We won.
- I knew it.

2171
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:44,360
(Jae Suk did it
exactly at the 2nd try.)

2172
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,620
Seriously...

2173
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,420
He's incredible.

2174
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,820
- This is unbelievable.
- I stuck so many swords.

2175
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,990
This is unbelievable.

2176
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:57,740
(The come-from-behind victory
made by an unlucky guy)

2177
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,240
- This is luck.
- He's indeed BTS.

2178
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,240
(Being mean)

2179
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:04,450
Team Jin won.

2180
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:05,870
- Okay.
- Okay.

2181
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:07,280
(Team Jin won.)

2182
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:09,210
I got dragged helplessly.

2183
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:10,650
Isn't it amazing?

2184
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:11,990
How many swords did you put in?

2185
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:14,910
- I stuck so many swords.
- We stuck ten.

2186
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:16,820
(Three swords, Twelve swords)

2187
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:18,780
I'm amazing.

2188
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,030
- We stuck so many swords.
- I played the game with my kids.

2189
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,120
I made it pop up every time.

2190
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,200
(Proud)

2191
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,370
(He's almost a dog
that searches dud.)

2192
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:29,370
I think I got something for it.

2193
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:32,370
This is really a hard game.

2194
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:33,530
(Haha and So Min,
Ji Hyo and Se Chan)

2195
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:35,030
You're so lucky.

2196
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:38,980
- Isn't it amazing?
- It's amazing.

2197
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:42,650
Se Chan used an exchange ticket...

2198
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:46,240
- to switch with So Min.
- Okay.

2199
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,690
(Se Chan from Team Jin
and So Min from Team Suk Jin)

2200
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,950
I'd like to switch with So Min.

2201
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:56,920
(Ssaebssaeb switched immediately
after his team lost round 1.)

2202
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,570
(Happy)

2203
01:16:58,570 --> 01:16:59,730
Hey.

2204
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:01,400
I'll win.

2205
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,700
He picked Jin.

2206
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:05,110
- It's a perfect victory.
- A perfect victory.

2207
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:06,870
You chose a winning path.

2208
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:08,910
- I choose a winning path.
- You chose a winning path.

2209
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:11,350
If you don't use the ticket,
it will become useless.

2210
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:13,410
You're so...

2211
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:14,780
He's the best.

2212
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:16,710
- Se Chan, take this.
- Okay.

2213
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:17,710
(Se Chan, take the Team Red outfit.)

2214
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:18,850
Yes.

2215
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:20,080
Gosh.

2216
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,450
My feet are cold.

2217
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,490
Can I use an exchange ticket?

2218
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:27,920
You can use it over there.

2219
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,030
Did you use it?

2220
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,660
- I guess so.
- Ji Hyo used an exchange ticket...

2221
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:37,070
- to bring Se Chan back.
- Come here.

2222
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,940
- I should win.
- Yes.

2223
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:41,030
- I should win now.
- We should win.

2224
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,030
(Ji Hyo who has to win
summons Se Chan again.)

2225
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:44,850
Stick them as you want.
We'll win then.

2226
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:45,910
Okay.

2227
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:48,370
We should win this time.
Right. Let's do a 2-on-2.

2228
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:50,020
What happened?

2229
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:52,150
- Suk Jin used the ticket again.
- Okay.

2230
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,160
Haha and Ji Hyo will switch.

2231
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,750
We should win.

2232
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,990
Hey, this is fun.

2233
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,400
Haha and Ji Hyo will switch.

2234
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,100
(It's girls versus boys again.)

2235
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,100
- We should win!
- Hey, this is fun.

2236
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,240
- We should win.
- Right. We should win.

2237
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,310
Haha, this is what I wanted
in the end.

2238
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:13,000
Gosh. Haha is so strong.

2239
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,480
(Screaming)

2240
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,940
Gosh. Haha is so strong.

2241
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:17,910
(Little One starts playing Jong Kook
against the girls.)

2242
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:18,980
My balloon.

2243
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,740
- He's so...
- Teasing me and calling me short.

2244
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,070
These guys...

2245
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:24,380
Where are you going?

2246
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,820
- Where are you going?
- Se Chan.

2247
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:29,860
Where are you going?

2248
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:30,860
You punks!

2249
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,950
(At that moment)

2250
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,990
Where are you going?

2251
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:37,570
(An uninvited guest
rushed into the place.)

2252
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,370
You punk.

2253
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,270
(He starts taking his revenge
with wrestling skills.)

2254
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:42,870
Who are you to...

2255
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:44,530
(The big guy from the opposing team
came as well.)

2256
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:45,740
Why are you messing it up?

2257
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,280
My gosh.

2258
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,070
(During the chaos)

2259
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,070
Ji Hyo.

2260
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,480
- Come on.
- Ji Hyo.

2261
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,480
(Haha is peacefully
sticking swords.)

2262
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,040
That's bad manners.

2263
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:00,690
What is that?

2264
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:01,820
Gosh, why won't it come out?

2265
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,160
(The pirate got stabbed many times
already.)

2266
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,250
- Hey.
- It came out.

2267
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:07,530
(The pirate escaped.)

2268
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,620
We're Kim Jong Kook.

2269
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,200
(Little Jong Kooks won in the end.)

2270
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,370
Okay. We're done.

2271
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,460
- Well done.
- You're so uncool.

2272
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,740
We were perfect.

2273
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:19,460
- We were the best duo. Okay.
- It was so cool.

2274
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:20,940
We have no rival in the world.

2275
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,200
- That was so sexy.
- That was nice.

2276
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:24,570
You guys won in a cool manner.

2277
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:25,570
- Yes.
- Okay.

2278
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:27,350
The production team acknowledged us.

2279
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:29,710
It's not cool at all.

2280
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,380
Let's play the last round.

2281
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,690
Two people from each team
can volunteer.

2282
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:35,750
- Jong Kook and...
- Okay.

2283
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:36,920
Jong Kook and Se Chan.

2284
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,250
Okay. Se Chan and me.

2285
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,560
- It's going to be fun.
- I'll be doing it.

2286
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,100
It's Suk Jin and me.

2287
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,990
- What?
- Suk Jin and I should do it.

2288
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:45,100
Yes.

2289
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:47,940
Let's just get a few and...

2290
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,770
Jong Kook came out again.

2291
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:51,460
Even Se Chan came out.

2292
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,480
Let's hurry up and go home.

2293
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:56,370
Let's do it at the first attempt
and have a thrilling win.

2294
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:59,070
(Which team will win?)

2295
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:00,980
- Let's do it. The final.
- Let's do it.

2296
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:05,150
- Are you ready?
- ARMYs around the world will cheer.

2297
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,990
(Go.)

2298
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,620
You got this.

2299
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,060
(Shouting)

2300
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:17,290
(It's going exactly the same
as how round 1 went.)

2301
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,940
(Se Chan bursts a balloon
comfortably.)

2302
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,240
Collect all of them.

2303
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,570
Hold them.

2304
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:29,330
(Two-on-one tug-of-war)

2305
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:32,110
My goodness. What's this?

2306
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,540
(Shouting)

2307
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:35,710
Collect all of them.

2308
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:39,710
(Tripping)

2309
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:42,660
(It's a balloon!)

2310
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:43,780
(Popping)

2311
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:46,860
(Crying)

2312
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,950
(Paper Doll
is crying his lungs out.)

2313
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:50,790
They're no match. My gosh.

2314
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:54,700
I'm sorry.

2315
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:58,570
(Shouting)

2316
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:03,670
I'm sorry, Jae Suk.

2317
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,480
What?

2318
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,540
(Trying to cheat)

2319
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:09,540
Give it to me.

2320
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:13,750
What? Is it not out?

2321
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:20,400
(The two became fitness equipment
for the gym-goer in the town.)

2322
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,400
Is it not out?

2323
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,290
(Meanwhile, Se Chan
starts attacking the pirate.)

2324
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:25,700
Come here.

2325
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,900
Stick them.

2326
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:27,900
Wait.

2327
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:30,460
Come here.

2328
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:33,110
Okay.

2329
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,740
(It came out.)

2330
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:40,150
(Team Suk Jin won.)

2331
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:41,280
It was perfect.

2332
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,280
Okay.

2333
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:44,210
They're so annoying.

2334
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:45,280
(Team Jin couldn't stick
a single sword in the end.)

2335
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,950
- Are you okay, Jin?
- Okay.

2336
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,420
- Are you all right?
- I'm mad.

2337
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,290
I wanted to put just one sword in.

2338
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:55,450
I'm so upset.

2339
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:56,560
(Jae Suk
went to stick just one sword.)

2340
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,700
I'm so upset.

2341
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:02,530
(Popping up)

2342
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:04,030
You did it at once again?

2343
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,870
If I had one more chance...

2344
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:07,610
This is Running Man.

2345
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:08,670
They're strong.

2346
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:10,110
- You're on my team.
- The mission is over.

2347
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:12,650
- Team Suk Jin won.
- Okay.

2348
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:16,950
- The winners will get 1 ticket.
- We get 1 ticket?

2349
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:18,690
Pick a ticket, one at a time.

2350
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:19,820
- One ticket?
- Okay.

2351
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:21,060
It's a pity.

2352
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,080
Right?

2353
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,120
(Whistling)

2354
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:27,750
So Min used an exchange ticket...

2355
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:29,560
so switch with Haha.

2356
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,270
- I can't pick a ticket then?
- No.

2357
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:32,460
I can't pick a ticket?

2358
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:36,570
(Shouting)

2359
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,810
(Ha Jong Kook throws her
to vent his anger.)

2360
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:40,160
Those with exchange tickets...

2361
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:41,830
We can draw just one, right?

2362
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:44,500
Someone used it again.

2363
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,240
Haha and So Min should switch.

2364
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,540
- Okay.
- Why?

2365
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:50,380
- Se Chan picked him.
- He picked him.

2366
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:52,850
- Okay. It might not be a penalty.
- Okay.

2367
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:54,020
If they get the penalty,

2368
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:55,190
- that's amazing.
- I know.

2369
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,120
What should I do? I hope
they receive a penalty.

2370
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,990
- We don't know yet.
- I hope they receive the penalty.

2371
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:02,790
I'll reveal the number
of penalty balls right now.

2372
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:04,120
- Okay.
- I think we got a lot.

2373
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,700
Team Red got six penalty balls.

2374
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:08,960
Okay.

2375
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,370
- Team Green got half of it, three.
- Okay.

2376
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:13,460
Okay. It's good.

2377
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:16,030
If they get it,
So Min will look more annoying.

2378
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:18,070
- I hope you get a penalty.
- Yes.

2379
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:19,650
We'll now draw the penalty ball.

2380
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:22,410
(Drawing the penalty ball)

2381
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,190
We'll now draw the penalty ball.

2382
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,320
Please.

2383
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,360
Here it is.

2384
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:46,760
(The color of the ball determines
the team for the penalty.)

2385
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,430
I will reveal the result.

2386
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,510
Team Jin lost.

2387
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:54,670
- Okay!
- Okay!

2388
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:57,040
Okay!

2389
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,940
(Everyone in Team Jin
gets a penalty.)

2390
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:01,350
Nice. There was no twist.

2391
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:03,510
Bring in the penalty item.

2392
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,720
It must be paint.

2393
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,850
- It's the whipped cream.
- That's better.

2394
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:09,090
(The whipped cream machine enters.)

2395
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:11,260
- No, it's whipped cream.
- It's whipped cream.

2396
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:13,060
- I think it's better.
- It's a relief.

2397
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:14,060
(At that moment)

2398
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:17,060
(Kim Suk Jin visits the booth.)

2399
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:19,970
I think he has an exchange ticket.

2400
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,140
I'll switch with...

2401
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,340
(There was an important announcement
about the booth use.)

2402
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:33,050
(As long as the booth is open,
the exchange ticket can be used.)

2403
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:35,140
(I'll switch with...)

2404
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:38,440
(The booth was still open.)

2405
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:39,790
(Jin saved his exchange ticket
until the penalty was determined.)

2406
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:41,050
Wait a minute.

2407
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:42,510
I should've saved
the exchange ticket.

2408
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:44,150
You should've saved it.

2409
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:46,260
Jin just used...

2410
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,130
- the last exchange ticket.
- He just used it.

2411
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,460
He's switching with Se Chan.

2412
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,260
(Se Chan)

2413
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:53,430
What?

2414
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:55,020
(What?)

2415
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,760
- Come here.
- Jin.

2416
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,600
This is my first time meeting him.

2417
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:03,140
Se Chan. You're the youngest.

2418
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,070
- Okay.
- You're the youngest.

2419
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:07,440
He's moving
to his girlfriend's team.

2420
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:09,610
Get the penalty
with your girlfriend.

2421
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:13,050
Four people should stand.

2422
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:15,920
Everyone in the team gets a penalty.

2423
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,850
It's been a while. I've missed you.

2424
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:20,390
Webfoot octopus?

2425
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,630
Again? Who?

2426
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:23,650
(Who used the exchange ticket?)

2427
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:25,690
- Who is it?
- Jong Kook...

2428
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,390
- used his exchange ticket.
- Okay.

2429
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:28,600
(Jong Kook saved
his exchange ticket.)

2430
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,430
Se Chan and Suk Jin are switching.

2431
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,170
Okay!

2432
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,230
(Se Chan and Suk Jin
are switching.)

2433
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:37,730
(Ji Suk Jin is getting
the penalty.)

2434
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:42,550
(After Jin and Se Chan switched...)

2435
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:45,380
Good job.

2436
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:48,640
(No look pass)

2437
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:52,060
I'll switch with Suk Jin.

2438
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:55,090
(Se Chan backstabbed Captain Ji
who was acting annoying.)

2439
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,720
- You were too...
- In the end,

2440
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:00,130
I'm getting the penalty
for Suk Jin.

2441
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:01,300
I don't mind.

2442
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,640
No, that's not how it works.

2443
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,540
- Jin, I don't mind.
- No.

2444
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:05,760
Jin, it's okay.

2445
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,930
You're doing it for Se Chan.

2446
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:08,040
- No.
- You're doing it for Se Chan.

2447
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,730
I didn't say anything, Suk Jin.

2448
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:12,140
- I knew it. Thank you, Suk Jin.
- Thank you.

2449
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:14,440
Here we go. Seriously.

2450
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:17,140
Careful with the aim,
so you can get it at once.

2451
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:18,850
- Thank you, Jong Kook.
- Does it hurt?

2452
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:20,250
- No.
- You saved me. I knew it.

2453
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:21,750
One,

2454
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:24,090
two, three.

2455
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:28,560
Suk Jin. That's too little.

2456
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:32,260
(Suk Jin looks different.)

2457
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,300
I'm sorry. It went up.

2458
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,320
- See?
- What are you doing?

2459
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,600
- It went up.
- Seriously.

2460
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,860
- Why did you make it go up?
- Suk Jin.

2461
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,930
- I still got hit.
- Suk Jin.

2462
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:44,930
Let's do it again
after hearing from Jin.

2463
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:46,070
Still, you can't do that.

2464
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:48,570
Suk Jin ruined it.

2465
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:51,880
Jin. I'll do it again for...
Where is he?

2466
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,350
- Yes?
- Jin. I'll do it again for you.

2467
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:56,290
Suk Jin. You can do it
three more times if you want.

2468
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,810
You're doing this for us.

2469
01:26:58,810 --> 01:26:59,820
What?

2470
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:02,850
Close your trap.
Why is this for you?

2471
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,850
(Getting angry)

2472
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,000
Jae Suk got it perfectly.

2473
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,630
- Why would you curse?
- When did I curse?

2474
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:09,970
You just did.

2475
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:12,060
Let's hear from Jin first.

2476
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,930
I've always wanted to be
on Running Man.

2477
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:17,970
Thank you so much for inviting me.

2478
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:21,680
This is my favorite show.

2479
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,350
Send lots of love to Running Man.

2480
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:28,250
If you love my episode,
I'd really app...

2481
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,010
- Appreciate it.
- Appreciate it.

2482
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:33,520
- Thank you.
- That's what I like about you.

2483
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,720
- Yes.
- It's humane.

2484
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,150
- Yes.
- No one is perfect.

2485
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:39,520
- Of course.
- That's your charm.

2486
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,520
- One, two,
- Come forward.

2487
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,000
three.

2488
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:46,400
This is what I'm talking about.

2489
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:47,970
Good job, everyone.

2490
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:49,540
Good job.

2491
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:50,600
(Thanks to Superstar Jin
for his appearance.)

2492
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2493
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:54,440
(This fall arrived later
than usual.)

2494
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:57,970
(FW hot trend fashion show
in the middle of Seoul)

2495
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,510
(Are you a carrot?)

2496
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:00,810
(Fashion keeper)

2497
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:02,250
Not everyone...

2498
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:04,060
(However, not everyone can
wear fall clothes.)

2499
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:07,090
(Today, they're going to
look for fall.)

2500
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:09,430
(Like this.)

2501
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,150
(In the sight of fall foliage,)

2502
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:12,460
(the cool breeze blows.)

2503
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:13,930
(It's so cold.)

2504
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:16,230
(A quiz with citizens...)

2505
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:17,640
(in the season for reading)

2506
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,040
(You're very intangible.)

2507
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,340
(They're purely embarrassing.)

2508
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,640
(They're getting far away
from their destination.)

2509
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:28,400
(Will they...)

2510
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,920
(be able to go home today?)

2511
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,350
- Close your mouth.
- Close your mouth.

2512
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:33,250
(Looking For Fall)

2513
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,250
