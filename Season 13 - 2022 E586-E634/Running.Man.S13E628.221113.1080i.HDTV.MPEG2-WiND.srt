1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,420
It's chilly. It's so windy.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,550
The wind is chilly.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,220
What's the weather like today?
Is this correct?

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,690
- Yes. Good job.
- Hello.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,430
Hello. What's the weather like today?

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,500
So windy. Today is so windy.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,970
- Gosh.
- Hello.

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,880
- The sun is...
- Hey.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,700
- The sun is my face.
- Pacquiao, how do I look?

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,950
The sun is my face.

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,770
- How do I look?
- It's too strong.

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,020
That's right.

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,340
Get out the sun.

14
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,450
- What are you doing?
- No, get out the shade.

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,060
- What is she saying?
- Is this right?

16
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,420
- Hello.
- Is it wrong?

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,620
No?

18
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,280
- You're here.
- You should study English at home.

19
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,160
I can't do that at home.

20
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,020
- Today, Ji Hyo...
- Yes.

21
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,800
- It's not a big accident.
- It's a minor collision.

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,590
- It's just a minor collision.
- It can happen.

23
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,300
So Ji Hyo is running late.

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,600
- You're here.
- Hey.

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,010
- There's Hancock.
- Hello.

26
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,240
(He shows up in a weird beanie.)

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,940
- Hello.
- You look cool.

28
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,550
- You look great.
- You're wearing shorts.

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,310
- Your shoes...
- Aren't your shoes...

30
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,020
- too much? These are...
- You're Hancock.

31
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,590
for Alaska or something.

32
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,620
It's not that cold yet.

33
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,060
The weather is warm now.
What's wrong with you?

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,620
- I heard it'd be cold today.
- That's not true.

35
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,230
- It's warm.
- It's not that cold. This is...

36
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,730
- This is too much.
- You should wear it in the snow.

37
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,260
I'm just wearing boots.

38
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,820
It must be hard for him though.

39
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,520
They are not just boots.
This is just too much.

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
- He will get tired.
- It's not right.

41
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,960
- Are you a choir member?
- What?

42
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
- A choir member or something?
- No, I'm him.

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,810
- What?
- Who is it?

44
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,930
- It's him.
- Right. You look the same.

45
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,210
He always prepares what to say.

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,180
- Hello, Suk Jin.
- Hi.

47
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,900
Why are you guys so early?
What is this?

48
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,210
Why are you late?
You're not supposed to be late.

49
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,240
I'm not late. You guys are early.

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,710
By the way, this is pretty.

51
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,210
Leave me alone.

52
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,820
I know you're trying to stretch it.

53
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,180
Stop doing that.

54
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,590
You should stretch the bottom.

55
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,430
- Like this.
- Don't stretch it.

56
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,960
- My gosh.
- I stretched his Gucci shirt.

57
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,620
- Right.
- Why would you do that?

58
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,620
- I stretched your Gucci shirt.
- My gosh.

59
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,520
He's wearing expensive clothes,

60
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,230
but the inner shirt is this long.
He keeps stretching it.

61
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,210
He bought an expensive shirt
after a long time.

62
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,170
What's with your outfit?

63
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,100
- What's wrong?
- I think it's pretty.

64
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,680
It looks good on you.

65
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,350
- It's pretty.
- You...

66
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,900
- You shouldn't dress up.
- He looks good.

67
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,180
It looks like you're desperate.

68
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,420
- I'm not desperate.
- Hey.

69
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,820
- Why would you say such a thing?
- It's for the fall.

70
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,010
It's simple, but it looks good.

71
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,350
Right. It's simple and normal.

72
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,580
- You do look nice.
- Okay.

73
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,320
You look great. It's pretty.

74
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,980
Jong Kook, you're dressed up too.

75
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,880
- I am.
- He's all dressed up.

76
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,890
You don't usually wear
things like this.

77
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,790
I didn't know you'd wear
a shirt like this.

78
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,760
- I look like a bear.
- Hey, Suk Jin.

79
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,890
This is a pretty shirt.
Why would you do that?

80
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,000
So Min looks pretty.

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
So Min, you look...

82
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,940
You look like a college freshman.

83
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,980
Is the purse for cigarettes?

84
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,010
I think so.

85
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,980
So Min,
you should pull it down a little.

86
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,300
(So Min,
you should pull it down a little.)

87
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,420
The wig.

88
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,420
(The wig)

89
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,720
It's done. You look much better now.

90
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,610
- That's better.
- You look better now.

91
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,690
You look a lot better
when it's pulled down a little.

92
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,790
Doesn't she look like a student
of an arts high school?

93
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,530
- She does.
- You look much better now.

94
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,950
She looks like
a high school student.

95
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,420
- I'm sorry.
- Ji Hyo, are you all right?

96
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,070
- Are you okay?
- Sorry.

97
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,730
- What's wrong?
- Are you all right?

98
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,170
- Is your car okay?
- Yes.

99
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,600
So your manager...

100
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,230
(Is your car okay?)

101
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,440
- So your manager...
- Why...

102
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,170
(Upset)

103
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,910
- Why?
- You should let your manager drive.

104
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,010
- So what happened?
- You should worry about me.

105
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,510
- Did your manager cause it?
- No.

106
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,670
- She drove herself.
- She drove herself.

107
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,420
Why do you drive yourself?

108
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,220
I asked her.
She says she's comfortable that way.

109
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,230
But you should let your manager
accompany you just in case.

110
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,820
So this place is...

111
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,600
Actually, Sinchon used
to be very crowded.

112
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,230
Right. I came here a lot
when I was Turbo.

113
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,700
There used to be a lot of cafes.

114
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,790
This place used to be
the fashion mecca.

115
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,790
Right. It was so popular.

116
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,330
I used to come here a lot.

117
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,200
I got my ear pierced
at the place over there.

118
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,040
- I did it too.
- For five dollars... Really?

119
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,070
(Nice to meet you.)

120
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,700
- Me too.
- You too?

121
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,800
I did it right over there.

122
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,610
- It was only five dollars.
- Turn right, and you will...

123
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,610
find the place.

124
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,140
Me too. They did it
with their hands.

125
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,950
- They just pressed it like this.
- Did you do it for neuralgia?

126
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,190
No.

127
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,190
- For neuralgia?
- It was for fashion.

128
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,690
There was a famous vintage shop
called Nylon here.

129
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,730
Right. It was Nylon.

130
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,200
- I bought many jeans there.
- Right.

131
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,230
My cousin used to run
a clothing store here.

132
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,890
- Really?
- She's in Texas now.

133
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,890
- It was over here.
- That's too much information.

134
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,630
Sook also ran a clothing store here.

135
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,440
- Sook did?
- A clothing store?

136
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,940
- She ran a clothing store?
- She probably met my cousin.

137
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,330
She used to run a clothing store.

138
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,940
This place reminds me
of old memories.

139
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,040
- I used to come here a lot.
- Right. I came here a lot.

140
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,200
Sinchon and Ewha University.

141
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,040
- I used to come here a lot.
- I came here a lot back in school.

142
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,020
- Where's Eagle Cafe?
- What?

143
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,480
- Eagle Cafe was over there.
- Near Yonsei University.

144
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,090
Didn't you go to Yonsei University?

145
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,610
- Yonsei University?
- She went to Yonsei University.

146
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,310
- Was there Eagle Cafe back then?
- Look at her face.

147
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,680
That's why you have that face.

148
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
"What do you know about Sinchon?"

149
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,790
When you weren't here,
we all came here and...

150
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,230
- Right.
- We supported the neighborhood.

151
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,060
It wouldn't have lasted
without Jong Kook.

152
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,420
- Of course.
- None of us...

153
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,930
went to Ewha Woman's University
or Yonsei University.

154
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,410
But the country
wouldn't have lasted without us.

155
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,340
- Ewha and Yonsei...
- But we...

156
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,080
- We vitalized the area.
- Jong Kook protected this place.

157
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,780
- You know that?
- They're the ones who protected it.

158
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,170
I protected
Ewha Woman's University and Sinchon.

159
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,110
- I didn't say anything.
- Right.

160
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,040
Are you saying
it's our inferiority complex?

161
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,420
- Hey, I came here a lot.
- Don't make me mad.

162
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,390
What's that face?

163
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,030
We're not saying this
out of an inferiority complex.

164
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,920
- Inferiority complex?
- This is an inferiority complex.

165
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,190
- You're smiling?
- This is an inferiority complex.

166
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,190
(Sinchon lovers
with inferiority complexes)

167
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,730
Fall is the shortest season
of the year.

168
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,790
- That's why I'm sad.
- It's so short.

169
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,300
So, today, we will have a race
that will bring fall...

170
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,080
back to our viewers.
It's called Looking For Fall.

171
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,230
(Looking For Fall Race)

172
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,500
It's your outfit...

173
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,080
- that shows the season well.
- Right.

174
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,420
But I can't let all of you
keep on the nice fall clothes...

175
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,590
- you're wearing now.
- Why not?

176
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,420
(Not all of them can keep on
the nice fall clothes they're wearing.)

177
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,730
You will get outfits of many
different seasons through missions.

178
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,160
- What?
- Oh, no.

179
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,460
Then we might get summer clothes.

180
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,330
- It's too cold.
- Or it could be winter clothes.

181
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,420
If all seven of you find
the fall clothes...

182
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,840
and put them on by three o'clock,
you can go home.

183
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,800
If you all find
the fall clothes before three,

184
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,670
- we will wrap things up right away.
- Really?

185
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,910
- So you need to find them quickly.
- Don't tell me...

186
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,580
you hid the clothes
where we can never find them.

187
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,710
It's not like that.

188
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,910
I won't let it slide.

189
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,350
Don't you dare hide them
at your place.

190
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,090
If you fail to find
the fall clothes by three o'clock,

191
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,350
you will get as many penalties
as the members who fail.

192
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,680
There will be penalties.

193
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,290
Today, Jae Suk will drive as he
knows the streets of Seoul well.

194
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,050
You can count on me
when it comes to Seoul.

195
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,730
You will drive
without a navigation device.

196
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,990
You can only use paper maps
or help from citizens...

197
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,430
You will drive
without a navigation device.

198
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,730
(Only paper maps?)

199
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,910
- to get to your destination.
- Paper maps?

200
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,600
- Paper maps?
- Paper maps?

201
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,170
(The reason why they planned
an analog tour like this...)

202
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,710
(Episode 625,
A Tour Around Seoul in Rain)

203
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,780
(I know how to get
to Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral.)

204
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,790
(Jae Suk drove without a navigation
device saying he knows the way.)

205
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,960
(Even when
Big Nose tried to help...)

206
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,120
(I'll figure it out.)

207
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,590
(Driver Yoo seemed quite confident
about the streets of Seoul.)

208
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,690
- He doesn't need navigation.
- You know what?

209
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,120
I don't need a map.
Just tell me where to go.

210
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,290
- Are you sure you don't need one?
- Yes.

211
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,670
- He just needs his feelings.
- Are you sure?

212
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,670
Of course.

213
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,730
The streets of Seoul...

214
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,140
- You should give us a map though.
- Just give us one.

215
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
I know every alley in the city...

216
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,730
because I walk around a lot.

217
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,640
He's all talk.

218
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,280
- The streets of Seoul...
- We will wander around a lot today.

219
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,980
The one in the passenger seat
should check the map.

220
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,080
- You know that, right?
- Sure.

221
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,310
- Like an assistant.
- In the passenger seat.

222
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,440
I'm not sure if I can read it.

223
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
You should get him
magnifying glasses too.

224
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,810
So he can read the map.

225
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,020
If any members use their phones...

226
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,550
to find the way while he is driving,

227
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,620
- please let me know in secret.
- Don't worry.

228
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,330
- Do we get something for that?
- If you tell me,

229
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,690
you will receive benefits...

230
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,230
when we choose members
for the penalty.

231
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,530
And...

232
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,770
- Those two.
- No. I won't say anything.

233
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,290
Let me tell you something.

234
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,360
We do use our phones a lot,

235
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,140
but we only use them
to search our names...

236
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,910
and check our social media.

237
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,300
- And stock prices.
- To check stock prices.

238
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,280
- These three things are all we do.
- Right.

239
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,080
There's no doubt.

240
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,020
All right then.
We will now decide on your outfits.

241
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,520
You will play the shoe-throwing game
that you haven't done in a while.

242
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,680
We have different sections that say
spring, summer, fall, and winter.

243
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,920
You will wear clothes
for the season you land in.

244
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,850
I don't have to change
if I pick fall.

245
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,230
Summer has to be the worst.

246
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,400
Right. It's too cold
to wear summer clothes.

247
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,140
You have only one chance
to throw your shoe.

248
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,840
If it lands out of the sections,
you will wear summer clothes.

249
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,730
- Summer clothes?
- If it goes out?

250
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,080
I bet you'll have to wear shorts
for summer.

251
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,140
Gosh, I have slim legs.

252
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,800
You will start right away
without any practice.

253
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,780
- Right away?
- We don't need to practice.

254
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,000
We don't need any practice.

255
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,610
- We just throw the shoes.
- This is...

256
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,290
what SoBangCha used to wear.

257
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,090
Why are there so many sections
for summer?

258
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,520
Because summer is long.

259
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,850
We have only one section
for spring and fall each.

260
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,290
There are a lot of sections
for winter too.

261
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,400
What...

262
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,550
There's only one for fall.

263
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,530
Because fall is short.

264
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,120
There's only one for fall.

265
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,640
There's only one for spring
and one for fall.

266
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,140
- Right.
- The rest is for summer and winter.

267
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,240
All right then.

268
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,670
- Do you want to give it a try?
- Let me try.

269
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,200
- What?
- You can start right away.

270
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,280
- We can start, right?
- Yes.

271
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,170
He's shaking.

272
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,470
- Oh, no.
- Fall!

273
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,510
(How will it go?)

274
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,610
- Oh, no.
- Fall!

275
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,670
Darn it.

276
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,710
Nice.

277
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,180
- Fall!
- It's winter.

278
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,840
- Darn it.
- Nice.

279
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,440
You picked winter clothes.

280
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,680
- It's not bad.
- Winter is not bad.

281
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,790
Right.

282
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,260
- Who's next? Ssaebssaeb?
- Me.

283
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,190
I'll go for fall.

284
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,220
- Ssaebssaeb.
- All right. Here I go.

285
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,560
- I'll definitely pick fall.
- It's done.

286
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,770
- All right. Here I go.
- I'll definitely pick fall.

287
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,640
(It goes close to fall.)

288
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,700
- It's done.
- Summer.

289
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,960
- You picked summer.
- It's summer.

290
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,610
Darn it.

291
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,880
- Fall is the best option here.
- Right.

292
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,800
- One of us has to make it.
- You all should wear fall clothes.

293
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,210
- Right?
- We have to.

294
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,780
- We need at least one.
- Go this way.

295
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,490
- I'll pick fall.
- Good.

296
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,990
- At least one of us should do it.
- It's done.

297
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,210
- It's fall!
- Fall!

298
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,290
No.

299
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,630
It's done.

300
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,690
It's fall!

301
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,590
(Summer and fall)

302
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,630
It's fall!

303
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,920
- No.
- It's fall.

304
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,670
It's done.

305
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,960
- It's fall!
- Fall!

306
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,140
- It's summer.
- No.

307
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,190
- It's fall.
- Summer.

308
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,040
- It's fall!
- Fall!

309
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,200
- It's summer.
- No.

310
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,410
- It's summer.
- It's fall.

311
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,140
- No.
- Fall. This is definitely fall.

312
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,440
Don't be ridiculous. It's summer.

313
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,650
Fall.

314
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,970
- It's fall.
- That's summer.

315
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,020
This is definitely fall.

316
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,210
- Don't be ridiculous. It's summer.
- This means...

317
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,710
- he looks down on Hyung In.
- How can this be summer?

318
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,760
- This is fall.
- It's in summer.

319
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,050
This is...

320
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,080
- It's summer.
- Fall.

321
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,450
Hey, what's with the whistle?

322
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,000
- Because he's...
- Hey.

323
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,660
To be honest,
you're ignoring Hyung In.

324
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,000
- How is this fall?
- This is...

325
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,630
I'm sorry.
I apologize on behalf of them.

326
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,040
They think they can deceive you.

327
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,140
- How can this be fall?
- That's not enough to fight for.

328
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,240
This is fall.

329
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,780
If you used the jimmy jib,
it would look like fall.

330
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,880
(The two unscrupulous members
keep saying it's fall.)

331
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,070
I'm sure. The jimmy jib...

332
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,540
- That was so close.
- Anyway...

333
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,650
The shoe is in summer,
but he says it's fall.

334
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,210
- I chose the wrong shoe.
- I know.

335
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,290
Does anyone of you...

336
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,890
Haha is worried about his shoe.
He says it's expensive.

337
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,290
I don't mind getting hurt,
but this shoe...

338
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,260
- You can use someone else's shoe.
- I'll lend you mine.

339
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,290
You can use mine.

340
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,860
It seems like Haha really cares
for his shoes.

341
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,630
- I guess they are expensive.
- No.

342
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,030
- Even if they're expensive...
- I'll go next.

343
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,290
They are very expensive.

344
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,830
Here I go.

345
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,060
Can I try?

346
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,510
- You look good, Se Chan.
- This is nice.

347
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,830
Hey, you look a lot better
with the sneaker on.

348
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,380
(It's Se Chan's sneaker.)

349
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,650
- Hey.
- I'm serious.

350
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,110
- This is really...
- It's different, right?

351
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,170
Hey, you look much better now.

352
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,290
- I waited for a year to get these.
- This is so much prettier.

353
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,680
It took me a year to get these.

354
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,660
Why would you wait
to get such shoes?

355
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,760
- This is a lot better.
- I really don't understand.

356
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,580
It looks good on you.
You should wear it.

357
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,000
Does it make you look taller?

358
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,130
I go like this, Jong Kook.

359
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,170
You can easily find shoes
like that at Dongdaemun.

360
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,460
- Hey.
- What's with this shoe?

361
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,590
What's wrong?

362
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,330
What is with this shoe?

363
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,270
(He calms himself
and throws a shoe.)

364
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,410
- Bounce out!
- Oh, no.

365
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,910
You get summer.

366
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,340
- That was too short.
- That silly thing.

367
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,780
(Haha didn't even make it
to the target.)

368
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,120
Looks good.

369
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,650
At least you hit the target.

370
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,920
It landed outside, so it's summer.

371
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,250
- You like summer anyway.
- Right. I do like it.

372
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,790
- Ji Hyo, you're the last one to go.
- Good luck.

373
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,990
- Ji Hyo.
- Wish me good luck.

374
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,920
Your odds here are worse than
in Las Vegas.

375
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
I know.

376
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,160
- She did it.
- What?

377
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I know.

378
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,180
(Ji Hyo goes for it
in the last turn.)

379
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,390
(To be safe, at least Ji Hyo
should get fall clothes.)

380
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,420
- She did it.
- What?

381
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,970
That was so close, Ji Hyo.

382
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,260
- I know.
- She did it.

383
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,790
That was so close, Ji Hyo.

384
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,390
I thought she would land in fall.

385
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,740
- You were so close.
- It's summer.

386
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,710
Only Suk Jin gets winter clothes,

387
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,430
and the rest of you
get summer clothes.

388
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,770
- Darn it.
- Please bring in the clothes.

389
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,950
- I'm the only one who got winter.
- That was so close.

390
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,250
The winter jackets have
hot packs in them.

391
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,310
- Hot packs?
- Yes.

392
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,380
- Hot packs in them.
- Hot packs?

393
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,220
If he takes off
the jacket in the car,

394
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,120
- please tell me.
- Wait a second.

395
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,020
I don't use
hot packs even in winter.

396
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,090
He can't unzip the jacket, right?

397
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,420
- I get hot easily.
- He shouldn't be cold.

398
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't even eat ginseng
because my body temperature is high.

399
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,230
My hands are always warm.

400
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,200
That's underwear.
That's not summer clothing.

401
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,900
(They look like underwear.)

402
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,260
- This is...
- Gosh.

403
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,030
- This is ridiculous.
- We have to wear that?

404
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,670
- This is underwear.
- What is this?

405
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,450
This is absurd.

406
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,510
Gosh, this is...

407
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,980
- What's this?
- Are we wearing only this shirt?

408
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,450
- What do we do?
- What is this?

409
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,490
- But the slippers look horrible.
- I don't wear slippers like these.

410
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,720
(It's a set of cool mesh
underwear and sandals.)

411
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,040
I don't wear sandals.

412
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,310
What is this one?

413
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,120
Are we supposed to wear
this sleeveless shirt?

414
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,090
- You can wear socks.
- Only underpants and this?

415
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,260
Then what?

416
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,890
I have to take this off right away.

417
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,420
We need decent clothes.

418
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,870
- We're celebrities.
- I have my own style.

419
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,870
This is...

420
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,840
- I look terrible.
- Gosh, this is...

421
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,110
Seriously, this is so lame.

422
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,630
It looks so ugly.

423
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
The fabric will keep you cool.

424
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,710
- Will you stop talking?
- Even the color...

425
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,310
That's enough, Hyung In.

426
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,770
I can feel that it's cool.

427
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,910
- Gosh.
- Look at Jae Suk.

428
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,510
What do we wear for the bottoms?

429
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,010
- Is this it?
- I...

430
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,620
- Actually, it looks like...
- He looks so funny.

431
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,260
you chose to wear it.

432
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,150
- It's a loose-fitting shirt.
- I...

433
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,730
- You seem to like it.
- It looks like I chose it myself.

434
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,330
- That's better than your clothes.
- You look good.

435
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,470
Jae Suk.

436
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,060
(He's all dressed up in blue.)

437
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,240
You look great.

438
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,430
- Your sandals look fashionable.
- It looks like my own clothes.

439
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,270
We have to go around together
no matter what.

440
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,610
We have to stick to each other.

441
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,580
If you go to the bathroom alone,
you'll get posted on SNS.

442
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,670
Don't go around by yourself.

443
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,720
- We should go around together.
- We have to move as a group.

444
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,310
This is crazy.

445
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,450
How am I supposed to wear this?

446
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,260
(Seok Sam is the only one
who has to wear winter clothes.)

447
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,330
Gosh, it's hot already.

448
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,830
I'm feeling so hot.

449
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,230
Hey.

450
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,920
I'm sensitive to heat.
I'm serious. I'm not joking.

451
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,340
(He puts on a padded jacket.)

452
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,630
My gosh.

453
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,060
Gosh, this is...

454
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,740
This jacket is for climbing
the Himalayas.

455
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,880
(The jacket is made for
the Himalayas.)

456
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,380
This is made for the Himalayas.

457
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,170
(The warmest padded jacket)

458
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,910
Gosh. These are fleece-lined gloves!

459
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,880
Of course. What did you expect?

460
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,620
I get hot very easily.

461
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,380
Isn't this jacket
from a very expensive brand?

462
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,550
Yes, it is.

463
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,020
Suk Jin, you're dressed nicely.

464
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,600
Don't say that, you punk.

465
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,890
- One grilled sweet potato, please.
- Rather than us, Suk Jin...

466
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,630
- One grilled sweet potato, please.
- Gosh.

467
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,390
What is this?

468
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,370
- I'm jealous. I want to wear that.
- Gosh, I'm so cold.

469
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,610
Se Chan looks as if he's wearing
his own clothes. He looks natural.

470
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,170
- I don't look like a celebrity.
- You look like you got dolled up.

471
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,900
This isn't
how a celebrity would dress.

472
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,610
- Gosh, seriously.
- Hey.

473
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,540
So Min was wearing
such a nice outfit earlier.

474
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,310
- Look how she looks now.
- I look shabby.

475
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,640
- If you complete the mission,
- Right.

476
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,990
- you can change into your clothes.
- It looks like his own clothes.

477
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,460
(They have to complete the mission
to wear fall clothes.)

478
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,460
It's too cold for this outfit.

479
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,550
- I'm so cold.
- This is practically a penalty.

480
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,700
All of you have changed
your clothes.

481
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,600
The first place to go is a book cafe
near Mount Inwang.

482
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,760
(A book cafe near Mount Inwang)

483
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,840
- What did she say?
- We'll go there looking like this?

484
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,400
- Looking like this?
- In this outfit? Are you serious?

485
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,300
- They're just insane.
- Use this map to find the way...

486
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,670
- while driving yourselves.
- This is driving me crazy.

487
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,110
- We need a map, Jong Kook.
- Jongno-gu.

488
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,900
- Hold on. From where we are now...
- Jae Suk.

489
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,850
- It's easy.
- Oh, this is the map we'll use.

490
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,040
You've never been to
Mount Inwang before.

491
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,120
Dongnimmun or Seodaemun Station...
And Baewha Women's University.

492
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,780
- He seems to know the way.
- Of course, I know.

493
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,910
- Where is it?
- Right.

494
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,460
It's near Gyeongbok Palace.
We can get there quickly from here.

495
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,130
- Where you had group dates before.
- What?

496
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,920
You had a group date with girls
from Jinseon Girls' High School.

497
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,550
- It wasn't that school.
- You got rejected there.

498
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,830
No, it was
Pungmoon Girl's High School.

499
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,330
- Pungmoon Girl's High School.
- Oh, I see.

500
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,000
- You got rejected?
- The former one is in Gangnam.

501
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,240
- He got rejected so many times.
- I'm not familiar with Seoul.

502
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,660
Okay. I've got it.

503
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,380
- I'll be counting on you.
- Don't complain...

504
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,240
- that we get there too quickly.
- You'll do well.

505
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,770
- I know Seoul. Just trust me.
- I know that.

506
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,950
- Just as you know Anyang.
- Okay. That's right.

507
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,380
- I know Seoul.
- Of course.

508
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,450
Now that you've checked the map,
you may leave.

509
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,090
- Can we keep the map?
- Sure.

510
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,310
- Let's go.
- Hey, I'm not ready yet.

511
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,880
My hands are sweating so much.

512
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,730
- We're here. On your left.
- Oh, that's the one? Okay.

513
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,860
We'll get in.

514
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,100
- Come on. Let's go.
- Come on.

515
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,020
The youngest members should sit
in the back.

516
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,520
- I'm so cold, Se Chan.
- I'm cold too.

517
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,660
Let's ask him to turn on the heater
instead of the air conditioner.

518
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,870
Jae Suk, please turn the heater on.

519
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,760
- Hey, no heater.
- At least the seat warmer.

520
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,900
- I'm so cold.
- We won't turn on the heater.

521
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,710
- Please turn the heater on.
- Don't say that.

522
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,030
- I'm so cold.
- Suk Jin.

523
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,380
- Yes?
- Here you go.

524
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,140
- What is it?
- The assistant MC should do it.

525
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,410
Give it to me.

526
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,220
Suk Jin, you should help me
while I'm driving.

527
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,350
Okay.

528
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,990
Where is our destination?
Oh, I see the book cafe.

529
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,380
(The destination is
approximately 16 minutes away.)

530
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,360
Let's move toward
Baewha Women's University for now.

531
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,960
Show me.

532
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,860
Daeshin High School
or Baewha Women's University.

533
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,550
I'm so hot. Gosh.

534
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,370
- I have to turn right here...
- Go toward Gwanghwamun for now.

535
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,700
No, we shouldn't go that way.

536
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,970
We should go toward Gwanghwamun.

537
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,140
- Gyeongbok Palace.
- No, we should go to Dongnimmun.

538
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,440
We can go in this direction
to get there.

539
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,270
- I know the way. Listen to me.
- Suk Jin rarely goes out.

540
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,140
Hey. I know the way for sure.

541
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,800
- I'll tell you directions.
- Make a right turn.

542
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,570
- I'll find the way. Be quiet.
- Turn right and enter the tunnel.

543
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,220
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Let's go.

544
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,280
- Turn right and enter the tunnel.
- Be quiet!

545
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,690
- Listen.
- Make a right turn.

546
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,280
- Gosh, I'm hungry.
- I'll find the way.

547
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,010
- Hey, make a right turn here.
- Be quiet.

548
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,820
- Turn right. To the left.
- Be quiet.

549
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,430
- To the left. Make a turn.
- Hey.

550
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,730
- Turn left.
- Don't tell me what to do.

551
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,520
- Go toward Severance Hospital.
- That's a long way around.

552
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,360
- That's right.
- That's a long way around.

553
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,830
- I'm taking a direct route.
- Turn right toward the tunnel.

554
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,530
- Be quiet.
- I'll tell you something.

555
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,940
- I've been living in Seoul...
- He sounds like an old fossil.

556
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,100
- since I was born...
- Make a right turn here!

557
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
- Hey.
- I told you to stay out of this.

558
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,480
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Learn English. "Backseat driver."

559
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,840
- "Backseat driver?"
- Yes.

560
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,280
- A passenger who nags the driver...
- "Backseat driver."

561
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,650
- is called a backseat driver.
- I see.

562
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,490
- Are we all backseat drivers?
- Don't be a backseat driver.

563
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,660
- No, only when you nag the driver.
- I should focus on the road.

564
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,260
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

565
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,930
- Quiet them down in the back.
- Sure. Be quiet, everyone.

566
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,090
Jae Suk is shooting the show!

567
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,470
- Stop nagging at us.
- Can't you see me working?

568
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,240
- He's the main MC, you know.
- Got it?

569
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,260
- My gosh. This is...
- Turn right and go straight.

570
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,800
Don't say anything.

571
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,640
- You tamed such a fierce dog.
- Just let him drive, Suk Jin.

572
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,140
You're an assistant MC.
So just be quiet.

573
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,140
- Hey. Gosh, I'm so hot.
- You see...

574
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,770
I'm sorry, guys,
but I'll roll down the window.

575
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,040
- No. Don't do that.
- Suk Jin, I'm cold.

576
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,150
Suk Jin, I'm cold.
Please roll the window up.

577
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,580
This is driving me nuts. I'm so hot.

578
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,190
Why am I the only one
who has to wear this?

579
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,760
Go straight
until you see the tunnel...

580
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,260
Suk Jin, don't say anything.

581
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,850
- Go straight...
- Just sit there and take a nap.

582
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,120
When I tell you we're there,
you can just say, "Oh, are we?"

583
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,030
Just don't say anything.

584
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,170
They gave us
such an easy mission for us.

585
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,910
- Let's stop there.
- You guys never use a GPS anyway.

586
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,210
- Who doesn't?
- Right?

587
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,480
- Old people never use it.
- Hey.

588
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,040
- I can't drive without a GPS.
- You don't use it anyway.

589
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,980
- They don't believe in it.
- I don't use a GPS either.

590
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,340
- They don't believe in it.
- True.

591
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,390
"Turn right? That's ridiculous.
I should turn left here."

592
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,610
- "My way is the right way."
- They're so stubborn.

593
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,760
- While driving, I would say,
- "What's wrong with it?"

594
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
"Why is the GPS telling me
to go that way?"

595
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,620
Exactly.

596
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,050
- "Why should I go that way?"
- It's hard.

597
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,200
"What? No."

598
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,260
- "I should go straight."
- "It's a long way around."

599
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,350
They always doubt it.

600
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,930
- Hey, I told you to go that way.
- That's why I don't use it.

601
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,400
And you should know
that it causes a traffic jam.

602
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,140
- Turn right to go to Dongnimmun.
- Go straight.

603
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,470
- Right. I should turn right.
- If you want to go that way.

604
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,180
- Why should we turn right?
- If we go toward Dongnimmun.

605
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,030
- Turn right to go to Dongnimmun.
- Go straight.

606
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,800
(Driver Yoo is going to turn left
when he should go straight.)

607
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,750
- The road condition is quite good.
- And turn right over there.

608
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,150
- Suk Jin.
- I know that.

609
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,840
- Just put it down.
- Suk Jin.

610
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
- I told you not to advise me.
- Suk Jin, put it down.

611
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,690
- Hold on. Why are we...
- He doesn't need your help.

612
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,780
Suk Jin, just take a nap.

613
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,390
- We're going the wrong way.
- No. We have to turn left here.

614
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,820
- Switch seats with Se Chan.
- I don't think so.

615
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,430
Doesn't the road
lead to Seodaemun Prison?

616
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,590
- Correct.
- Right?

617
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,520
If we turn left, it leads to
Dongnimmun Station, right?

618
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,360
- That's correct.
- Good. Then it's okay.

619
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,970
- Oh, wait.
- Hey, drive.

620
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,330
- We shouldn't go that way.
- I said, drive.

621
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,270
- See? I told you to go straight.
- I should've gone straight.

622
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,100
(Departed: Shinchon Station,
Destination: Book Cafe)

623
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,610
(ETA: 10:46 a.m.)

624
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,450
It's not a big deal.
Why would you get worked up?

625
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,780
I've been living here...

626
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,160
- for over 50 years.
- We shouldn't go that way.

627
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,050
- Suk Jin.
- Gosh, I kept telling you.

628
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,520
Why won't you trust me?

629
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,730
- Let me explain, Suk Jin.
- We have to go around.

630
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,200
- I thought it was on that side.
- No, it's on the left side.

631
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,360
- I know. I was mistaken.
- I told you that.

632
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,000
- Suk Jin, I'm impressed.
- Don't be mad.

633
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,060
- Why would you get so upset?
- Everyone makes a mistake.

634
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,210
- The traffic might be bad that way.
- He's turning the car around.

635
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,910
- I'll turn around.
- And then make a left turn.

636
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,180
"The map was made
because they took the wrong road."

637
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,570
It was so obvious
that he was turning the car around.

638
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,310
- Hey, what did I do so wrong?
- We're all ganging up on him.

639
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,580
- What did I do, Jong Kook?
- I mean...

640
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,280
- He was turning the car around.
- I perfectly...

641
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,580
- Se Chan, sit in the front seat.
- Jae Suk, can I do it instead?

642
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,050
- Switch seats with Suk Jin. Go.
- That's a good idea.

643
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,620
- Why should I?
- Switch seats with Se Chan.

644
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,620
- I can't get out here.
- I can't drive with you there.

645
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,520
- Se Chan, hurry up and come.
- He'll direct you from the back.

646
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,260
- But I was right all along.
- Hurry up and go.

647
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,560
Give me the map.
I can do it in the back.

648
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,030
- Go and switch seats with him.
- Gosh. This is so frustrating.

649
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,330
Get up here Se Chan.

650
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,410
So we should go straight
toward Baewha Women's University.

651
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,340
Turn left right in front of
Baewha Women's University.

652
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,210
- Okay.
- After Daeshin High School.

653
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,840
- Okay.
- It's in my head now. Tear it up.

654
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,390
- No. I'll keep it.
- Just tear it up.

655
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,280
(Driver Yoo is full of confidence.)

656
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,720
- The staff members must be...
- I told you so.

657
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,820
expecting us to get lost
and create funny scenes.

658
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,200
- I'll prove them wrong.
- You'll...

659
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,000
- Listen. Because you took...
- What?

660
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,560
the wrong turn,
we wasted 15 minutes.

661
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
- I can explain. I had no choice.
- Don't be hard on him, Suk Jin.

662
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,300
- We wasted 15 minutes.
- You should've told me directions,

663
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,600
- but you failed to do so.
- That's not true.

664
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,770
I told you to go straight
numerous times.

665
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,770
- You should've pushed it harder.
- I have the map in my head now.

666
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,810
- I feel bad for Suk Jin.
- That was hilarious.

667
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,270
- Suk Jin was right about it.
- In this direction.

668
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,780
- Suk Jin was right all along.
- Really?

669
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,990
He was right,
but we all ignored him.

670
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,150
I was right.
We should've gone this way.

671
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,220
- Stop going on about it.
- Like I said, I was mistaken.

672
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,350
- Why didn't you trust me?
- Jae Suk.

673
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,460
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

674
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,350
Think about your health. Relax.

675
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,090
- All right.
- Don't get stressed out.

676
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,290
- Think about your health. Relax.
- All right.

677
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,670
("Think about your health?")

678
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,900
"Think about your health?"

679
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,900
- I'm sweating in winter clothes.
- He may...

680
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,860
- He may have a muscular body,
- Aren't you worried about me?

681
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,260
- but he catches a cold easily.
- That's true.

682
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,410
But Suk Jin wouldn't stop
going on about it.

683
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,440
(The friendship between them
grows stronger every day.)

684
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,410
- "Think about your health."
- I know I should always...

685
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,070
- stay positive.
- Look after your health.

686
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,180
- I'll do that.
- Don't get stressed out.

687
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,220
- Thanks to you...
- That's thoughtful.

688
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,510
Gosh, why did you turn on
the seat warmer?

689
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,190
When did you turn it on?

690
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,690
Gosh, I'm already so hot.

691
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,460
We should go toward
Baewha Women's University.

692
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,730
I'll find the way.

693
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,900
Hold on.
I should see the sign carefully.

694
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,020
Look. Baewha Women's University is
written on the sign.

695
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,590
I'm not allowed to
make a left turn here,

696
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,670
- so I'll make a U-turn.
- Make a U-turn.

697
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,830
- And then... We're here.
- We should go that way. Okay.

698
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,900
Let's go.

699
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,710
You're amazing.

700
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,740
- Great job.
- I'm amazing, right?

701
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,030
- When we first came here...
- We have great teamwork.

702
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,530
- It worked out as he was quiet.
- I know every place...

703
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,250
- in Seoul.
- Things are going smoothly now.

704
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,180
- Had you listened to me earlier,
- I know every place in Seoul.

705
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,610
we would've passed here
20 minutes ago.

706
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,010
I know every place in Seoul.

707
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,280
- We're okay now.
- Gosh.

708
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,540
I found the way. Okay!

709
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,810
- Things are working out so well.
- Exactly.

710
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,230
This is what I told you guys about.

711
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,290
- Looking back now,
- This is driving me nuts.

712
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,320
- when I was financially struggling,
- Yes.

713
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,760
- I walked a lot. It all paid off.
- That's a sad story.

714
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,260
- I came here a lot for a date too.
- Who?

715
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,330
- You're lying.
- Stop lying. I don't believe you.

716
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,870
There's no way
you came here for a date.

717
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,540
I'm sure you walked around alone
picking up some cigarette butts...

718
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,650
- because you had no money.
- Hey.

719
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,180
- I bet he asked for cigarettes too.
- Absolutely.

720
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,010
- I'm telling you...
- Jae Suk.

721
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,150
I'm sorry, but I can't help you
if you tell such a lie.

722
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,580
- I guess I made you worry.
- Of course.

723
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,490
- "Think about your health."
- Exactly. Think about your health.

724
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,260
Hey. Make a right turn.

725
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,160
- Turn right.
- This is Baewha Women's University.

726
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,090
- Oh, right. We're on the right way.
- Yes. We're on the right way.

727
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,470
The staff members must be bored.
We didn't even get lost.

728
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,470
I think you should
come up with another plan.

729
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,260
So Min,
tell them to make a new plan.

730
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,330
- Make a new plan.
- Make a new plan.

731
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,910
- In 1, 2, 3. Make a new plan.
- Make a new plan.

732
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,410
- What do you mean by that?
- I'm talking about this mission.

733
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,510
- Why?
- It's too easy for us.

734
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,220
- I know many good restaurants here.
- It's a great photo spot.

735
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,840
- There are lots of nice cafes here.
- That place looks nice.

736
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,950
- It's pretty.
- In this area?

737
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,990
Yes.

738
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,150
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

739
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,110
- Should I go straight or turn left?
- No.

740
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,580
Hey, Baewha Women's University is
on our left side.

741
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,580
- On our left side?
- Yes.

742
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,020
- Then we're on the wrong way.
- See? I told you so.

743
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
(Destination: Book Cafe)

744
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,960
(The route
that Jae Suk should've taken)

745
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,470
- We should go back.
- Then...

746
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,230
- Let's ask someone.
- Se Chan.

747
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,500
- Should it be on our right side?
- Yes, it should be,

748
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,330
- but it's on our left side now.
- We should turn around.

749
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,410
We should turn around.

750
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,640
- I was right about turning right.
- Yes, you were right.

751
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,870
- That place looks nice too.
- I was right.

752
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,800
- Turn right around the university.
- Look, Ji Hyo.

753
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,220
I see a lot of
nice restaurants here.

754
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
Sundaeguk sounds so delicious.

755
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,510
- Even in the old days,
- Sundaeguk? Oh, my.

756
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,340
- I like sundaeguk.
- taxi drivers...

757
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,190
- always asked for directions.
- You're right.

758
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,260
- They asked people on the street.
- Yes, in the old days,

759
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,320
we didn't have navigation systems.

760
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,260
- "Excuse me."
- Let's ask. It'll be faster.

761
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,050
- Right. Ask someone.
- We can ask for directions...

762
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,930
- when we're almost there.
- Here...

763
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,430
The stores are cute and pretty.

764
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,120
I really love fall. Look at this.

765
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,240
- It's beautiful.
- It's nice.

766
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,600
- This street is so beautiful.
- Indeed.

767
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,240
- Everything is so pretty here.
- Oh, we're in Sajik-dong.

768
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
What's the name
of this elementary school?

769
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,440
That cafe looks so pretty.

770
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,800
- This neighborhood...
- Maedong?

771
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,830
- Seoul Maedong Elementary School.
- Oh, I see.

772
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,710
Right? Look at that.

773
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,220
(There's only a main street
around the book cafe.)

774
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,280
- Jae Suk.
- This isn't the right way.

775
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,340
This neighborhood looks nice.

776
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,720
- It looks so nice, right?
- Yes.

777
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,610
- Hey, I used to come here...
- It's nice.

778
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,690
- We should interview some people.
- I know, right?

779
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,350
I think it would be better
to take the main road.

780
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,290
- I agree.
- Why are we in a narrow alley?

781
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,560
It's okay. We'll find the main road.

782
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,820
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

783
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,060
- This is Baewha Women's University.
- We should...

784
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,240
- Where is it?
- Here.

785
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,330
- Are you sure?
- It says it's a dead end.

786
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,860
- This is Baewha Women's University.
- It's a dead end.

787
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,300
- It says it's a dead end.
- This is Baewha Women's University.

788
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,240
(No passing, no roads ahead)

789
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,340
- I think we're lost.
- Show me. No, we're not.

790
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,250
- We're not lost.
- We're going the right way.

791
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,420
- We should keep going.
- Are you sure?

792
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,450
It should be around here
or up there.

793
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,720
It must be on the top.

794
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,450
- But there's a dead end sign.
- I'm sure we're almost there.

795
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,490
I see.

796
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,890
I think it will be a dead end.

797
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,420
He only thinks about the direction.

798
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,160
- Listen, Suk Jin.
- Great. He's like a runaway train.

799
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,550
(It's a dead end.)

800
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,850
- It's a dead end.
- There's no way ahead.

801
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,290
- Turn the car around.
- There's no way ahead.

802
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,320
- Jong Kook.
- You can turn it around here.

803
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,240
Jong Kook said it was a dead end,
but Jae Suk didn't listen.

804
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,510
- Let's not get flustered.
- Make a U-turn here.

805
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:18,010
- They don't listen to others.
- Jong Kook said it was a dead end.

806
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,210
"Too many cooks spoil the broth."

807
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,040
Exactly. Guys, So Min just said,

808
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,450
- "Too many cooks spoil the broth."
- "Too many cooks spoil the broth."

809
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,040
Just leave it to me, okay?

810
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,250
- Okay.
- Right.

811
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,650
Had he not come
to this blocked street,

812
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,990
we would never have had a chance
to see this neighborhood.

813
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,690
- You're being too generous.
- Don't you think so?

814
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,230
- The power of optimism.
- You know I'm right.

815
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,460
- You've gone too far.
- I'm speechless.

816
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,730
- What you should see is...
- Yes.

817
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,930
- Look how well I'm turning the car.
- Exactly.

818
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,790
It's an advanced skill.

819
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,590
- Hey, this...
- It's an advanced skill.

820
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,060
Anyone can do that...

821
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,030
- I like the way you say that.
- if they know how to drive.

822
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,830
- Right. Nice!
- Who wouldn't be able to do that?

823
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,250
- This is the best driving skill.
- I should've gone that way.

824
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,450
Oh, no. It's a one-way street.
You can't turn right.

825
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,750
You're right. I should go around.

826
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,780
- Suk Jin is good at staying calm.
- This is driving me nuts.

827
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,540
But didn't you expect this much?

828
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,220
- It's a one-way street.
- I can't know every street.

829
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,850
- Let me ask someone.
- Right. You should do that.

830
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,620
- Let's ask a passerby.
- Ask someone if you don't know.

831
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,460
They say that you should ask others
when you can't figure something out.

832
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,700
- Right. Even when we know the way.
- Go ahead.

833
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,760
- What should I say?
- Suseong-dong Valley.

834
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,930
Sunrise Hill.

835
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,320
- Hello.
- It's a park.

836
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,140
- The map isn't accurate.
- You're right.

837
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,640
- Ask where Mount Inwang Park is.
- Just ask...

838
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,360
- Let me ask. Hey, kid.
- where Suseong-dong Valley is.

839
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,800
- Hey, kid. Excuse me.
- My goodness.

840
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,030
(The kid leaves.)

841
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,800
- Why that little...
- Hey. "Kid?"

842
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,450
How rude. She should've stopped.

843
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,950
Hey, a middle-aged lady is coming.
I think she lives here.

844
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,450
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- You should turn left...

845
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,580
Can you tell me how to get
to the park in Suseong-dong?

846
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,220
(She walks past them quickly.)

847
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,080
It's near the park.

848
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
- Are you a ghost?
- She didn't want to be bothered.

849
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,350
- My gosh.
- Hey.

850
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,820
Why...

851
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,230
- Are you a ghost?
- The park.

852
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,590
Am I invisible or something?

853
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,560
- How about we ask a realtor?
- Where is Suseong-dong Valley?

854
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,710
- I don't know.
- How about the park?

855
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,140
She has never heard of it.

856
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,140
(They failed to get directions
from citizens.)

857
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,300
- Isn't that a school?
- It's because...

858
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
- Wait.
- Jae Suk.

859
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,450
- Sir.
- Sir.

860
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,950
Isn't that a school?

861
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,510
(Someone came out of the store
at the right timing.)

862
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,310
- We saw another way to go up.
- Go straight and turn left.

863
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,990
- Right.
- He said that. Why didn't you stop?

864
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,520
What I'm saying is
that he should've followed...

865
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,120
the main street
instead of turning left here.

866
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,620
It's a faster way.
There's a narrow street here.

867
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,820
Honestly, I can't bear this.
I want to search online.

868
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,830
Look at the map.
We're going this way.

869
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,210
Baewha Women's University is
behind us right now.

870
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,560
- You're right.
- We should go right.

871
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,030
- No. He said to go left.
- Why did he tell us to go left?

872
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,540
- Jae Suk, I think...
- Jae Suk!

873
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,150
we should take the man's advice.

874
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,650
He said we should go left.
This is a one-way street.

875
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,510
- We drove past this place earlier.
- Listen.

876
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,840
- Trust me.
- My gosh.

877
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,990
- You drive me crazy.
- The sundaeguk place looks nice.

878
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,990
- I said this earlier, right?
- I know how I should get there.

879
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,260
(Hi)

880
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,620
(They drove on the same street
15 minutes ago.)

881
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,030
Why are we going the same way?
What is the reason?

882
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,510
Why else? We're trying to find
our way to the destination.

883
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,830
- But we drove past here.
- It's so quiet and peaceful here.

884
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,240
Enjoy watching the stonewall.

885
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,770
- I'm cold.
- Exactly.

886
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,450
There's a road sign over there.

887
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,870
- What does it say?
- We passed this place before.

888
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,420
- Read it out loud.
- We passed this place.

889
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,720
I mean, this map is...
Baewha Women's University is...

890
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,160
- It's because...
- This is Baewha Women's University.

891
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,730
- Maybe it's not. You're wrong.
- It's Baewha Women's University.

892
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,460
This is Baewha Women's University,
Suk Jin.

893
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,050
- Is it really this small?
- Yes, it's written there.

894
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,000
- This is Baewha Women's University.
- Right.

895
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,970
- He's right. I saw it written.
- Yes, it is.

896
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,470
- Yes. Jae Suk...
- This is Baewha Women's University.

897
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,740
- Make a right.
- Turn right!

898
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,670
- Turn right.
- Speak louder.

899
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,940
- I don't think I should.
- Speak louder.

900
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,030
- He won't listen anyway.
- See? It's allowed. Look.

901
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,070
- Jae Suk.
- It's a kindergarten.

902
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,650
Yes, that's it. Jae Suk,

903
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,540
- we went down the street...
- Sir.

904
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,890
- We went down the street...
- Sir.

905
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,040
(He chuckles.)

906
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,460
- Speak up, will you?
- Sir...

907
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,620
- I can't do that.
- There he is.

908
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,620
Sir, how do we get
to Suseong-dong Valley?

909
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,620
I told you to turn left.

910
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,000
- How do we get there?
- I told you to turn left.

911
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,200
- Yes, you did.
- "I told you to turn left."

912
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,320
- "I told you to turn left."
- You'll see a pavilion.

913
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,330
Turn left there
and go up the street.

914
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,440
- Oh, I see.
- I see. Thank you, sir.

915
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,300
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

916
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,240
- Why didn't you listen to him?
- Exactly.

917
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,940
- He said to go left.
- I just wanted to check it again.

918
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,650
- It's not that you wanted to...
- He double-checked it.

919
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,250
- Gosh. You frustrate me.
- That's right.

920
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,950
- You should've turned left earlier.
- I told you to go left many times.

921
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,150
Despite everything, I feel relaxed
since Jong Kook is here.

922
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,340
That's good.
You should all relax a little bit.

923
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,890
- Exactly. Relax a little bit.
- Right. Why are you all on edge?

924
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,780
Hey, guys, look after your health.

925
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,460
Jong Kook is such a nice person.

926
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,760
When you drive a car
with many other people in it,

927
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,020
- you feel pressured.
- You should...

928
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,090
- You need to change your name...
- We shouldn't pressure him.

929
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,820
- to "Honey Kim."
- "Honey Kim?"

930
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,860
(Chuckling)

931
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,030
- I'll call him Honey Kim.
- Honey Kim.

932
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,030
(Laughing)

933
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,830
- Honey Kim?
- He's so sweet.

934
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,530
And he's so gentle.

935
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,450
- Sweet and gentle?
- Honey Kim.

936
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,980
Honey Kim.

937
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,340
- I like that name. It's not bad.
- Right.

938
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,220
- No.
- We'll probably find...

939
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,220
We haven't reached the pavilion.

940
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,450
- Jae Suk, go a little further.
- You should keep going.

941
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,190
- The pavilion...
- He said to go left.

942
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,280
You are off course.

943
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,690
- We haven't reached the pavilion.
- No. You should turn left...

944
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,730
- when you see the pavilion.
- This isn't...

945
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,620
He said we would see it
if we keep going.

946
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,020
- An espresso bar. It looks nice.
- He said to turn when you see it.

947
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,020
- It looks really nice.
- The pavilion...

948
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,330
We're all talking
about different things.

949
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,740
He said you should turn left
when you see the pavilion.

950
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,410
- Yes, that's what he said.
- Turn right here.

951
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,570
Hyung In,
I think you need a new plan.

952
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,840
- We're not working together.
- Exactly.

953
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,410
- Turn right here. Listen to me.
- We're not working together.

954
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,650
- We...
- You can see Mount Inwang.

955
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,110
- Yes, I can see it.
- That's Mount Inwang.

956
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,720
He's following his gut.
I'm sure you'll find the way.

957
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,960
- We're done for. We are...
- Are we?

958
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,160
- on this street right now.
- Tell me.

959
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,260
- Then tell me this one thing.
- And it's because...

960
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,820
Be quiet so that I can find the way.

961
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,000
- I'll show you that I can do that.
- Everyone, quiet down.

962
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,930
- Let's be quiet.
- Okay.

963
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,820
You must be happy to have someone
you can always count on.

964
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,670
- He's more than reliable.
- It's great.

965
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,740
- I'm impressed.
- Honey Kim.

966
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,100
- It's beautiful.
- This must be Suseong-dong Valley.

967
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,410
Go left.

968
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,870
Where should we go?

969
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,240
- Gosh, I'm so hot.
- The road will end.

970
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,570
- This is driving me nuts.
- Where is the book cafe?

971
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,340
- It's really beautiful.
- I don't see it.

972
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,840
- My, look at that.
- We're not there yet.

973
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,070
- There's no road ahead.
- It looks nice.

974
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,650
- Jae Suk.
- This is Suseong-dong Valley.

975
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,660
Look. Suseong-dong Valley is here.

976
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,160
We have to go left
following this street.

977
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,350
We should go back.

978
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,780
But we can't drive on that street.

979
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,500
I think we should park here
and walk to the cafe.

980
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,590
No. They told us not to use a GPS
because we can drive there.

981
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,930
You have a point.

982
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,440
We should've gone this way.
Following the main street...

983
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,760
You empty heads.

984
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,740
Hey, chicken head. Shut it.

985
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,360
- Chicken head, shut it.
- Chicken head?

986
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,440
- You stone head.
- You bird head.

987
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,450
It's the same map.

988
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,340
But this is Suseong-dong Valley.

989
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,150
Jae Suk, let's get there today.

990
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,150
- We can drive up the street?
- But are you sure...

991
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,280
- that the book cafe is up there?
- Jae Suk.

992
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,810
- It's not on a street like this.
- I don't think it's up there.

993
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,890
We should go that way.

994
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,510
- Isn't it around here?
- No.

995
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,690
With the valley on our right side...

996
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,900
- Jae Suk, listen.
- Are you starting to get annoyed?

997
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,620
- This street...
- Jae Suk.

998
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,620
He's starting to get annoyed.

999
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,290
- Jong Kook, tell him.
- It's time to be yourself.

1000
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,590
- Stop putting up with him.
- Quit acting like that.

1001
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,940
- Jae Suk, I have an idea.
- Jong Kook.

1002
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,710
- Jong Kook, please go back...
- Jong Kook.

1003
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,830
- to how you used to be.
- Be yourself again.

1004
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,940
- Be the tough Jong Kook again.
- You're not "Honey Kim."

1005
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,340
- I think he's doing well.
- You're not "Honey Kim."

1006
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,410
Be the mean Jong Kook again.

1007
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,220
- Exactly.
- The mean Jong Kook?

1008
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,150
Yes. Be the mean Jong Kook again.

1009
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,840
Gosh. I'm so hot.

1010
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,610
- It's not on a street like this.
- I don't think it's up there.

1011
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,610
- Maybe we should go that way.
- Isn't it around here?

1012
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,850
- No, it's not on the street.
- Let's ask a local.

1013
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,230
- Let's ask.
- You should speak up.

1014
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,160
- He won't listen to me.
- The cafe's name isn't written.

1015
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,460
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

1016
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,320
How about you listen to Se Chan...

1017
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,520
- and go as he suggests?
- Sounds good.

1018
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,140
- Since you keep getting lost here,
- Yes.

1019
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,240
go to the main street...

1020
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,830
How about we ask a bus driver?

1021
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,530
- That's a great idea. I agree.
- Right?

1022
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,910
- We should ask a local.
- I'll ask a bus driver.

1023
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,040
There's someone.

1024
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,770
- We have to ask a local.
- But...

1025
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,040
- Hello, sir.
- our destination is the book cafe.

1026
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,810
Sir, hello. Could you please
have a look at this?

1027
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,450
- Can you tell us...
- Thank you.

1028
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,810
Where do you think
this narrow street is?

1029
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,730
- You have to...
- Isn't this the book cafe?

1030
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,260
- Where is it?
- It's up there.

1031
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,660
- Up there.
- Is it up there?

1032
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,060
- "C" cafe.
- Is it up there?

1033
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,200
- Really? How do we drive there?
- Yes.

1034
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,030
- Go this way to the main street.
- I see.

1035
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,600
- Yes.
- Turn right and take Bugak Skyway.

1036
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,030
- I see. Bugak Skyway.
- Really?

1037
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,250
- Got it. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1038
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1039
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,110
- Great. Thank you!
- Let's go!

1040
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,040
- Gosh. This is so difficult.
- Okay.

1041
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,310
- You were right all along.
- Let's go!

1042
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,420
I wonder when Jong Kook
will return to his old self.

1043
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,050
- Be the mean Jong Kook again.
- Be yourself again.

1044
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,580
This is the third time
I've seen this sundaeguk place.

1045
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,060
- That's why I told you...
- We've been going around here.

1046
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,850
- When we go that way...
- You should turn here.

1047
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,720
- Hey, I have an idea.
- Se Chan was right all along.

1048
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,620
You shouldn't turn right here.

1049
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,430
- Go further and take Bugak Skyway.
- I know. Hey.

1050
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,970
- I have an idea.
- I told you that ten times.

1051
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,270
- Hey. Haha, get out.
- Keep going.

1052
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,700
- Why should I?
- Haha, get out.

1053
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,810
- Not here.
- You...

1054
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,810
You can walk.

1055
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,040
- Get out.
- Why me?

1056
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,540
- Why?
- I don't appreciate the blabbering.

1057
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,370
- Why me?
- Take a cab instead.

1058
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,580
- Take a cab.
- What did I even say?

1059
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,620
Jong Kook.

1060
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,720
Say you're sorry.

1061
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,850
Just say you're sorry.

1062
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,950
Don't think less of this van.
If you are to ride with us...

1063
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,080
- Apologize.
- I'm sorry.

1064
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,180
- Good.
- There you go.

1065
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,450
- That's how it should be.
- Make a left up there.

1066
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,560
Give him a break this one time.

1067
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,720
You brat.

1068
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,270
Are we in the military
with you two as our officers?

1069
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,890
- That's not it.
- Suk Jin, get out.

1070
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,040
What...

1071
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,060
He's a real thug.

1072
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,010
- Jae Suk.
- Who are you to order me around?

1073
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,010
- Because I'm the driver.
- He's the worst.

1074
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,370
- How can I get off?
- Just like that...

1075
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,040
- You should get off.
- Yes, get off.

1076
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,850
I'm telling you to shut it.

1077
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,310
He reminds me of my eldest uncle.

1078
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,680
On the right.
See? I was right all along.

1079
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,120
- Here we go.
- This is the one.

1080
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,350
- We're going the right away.
- What a pretty path.

1081
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,890
(ETA: 11:27 a.m.)

1082
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,910
- We're going the right way.
- Look how pretty it is.

1083
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,520
- This is the one. What a delight.
- Look at that.

1084
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,620
- I've been here on my bike before.
- Isn't this beautiful?

1085
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,160
- What a sight.
- It's beautiful.

1086
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,660
- They seem overly positive.
- Why go elsewhere...

1087
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,970
when Seoul has these gems?

1088
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,330
- Goodness.
- We'll probably be back...

1089
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,390
- next year for a drive.
- Exactly.

1090
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,100
- It's on the right.
- There it is.

1091
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,040
- On the right.
- I can't believe it was this hard.

1092
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,540
We're finally here.

1093
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,970
- Good job, everyone.
- Nice!

1094
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,180
- Okay.
- Good.

1095
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,510
Good job, everyone.

1096
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,870
It's beautiful here.

1097
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,640
- Let's go. Gosh, it's hot.
- I'm glad we're here.

1098
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,520
(The roasted chestnut vendor
finally escapes from the vehicle.)

1099
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,080
- Jong Kook, come on.
- What?

1100
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,180
Okay!

1101
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,330
- The clothes are shabby though.
- It's summer.

1102
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,060
What the...

1103
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,760
The heat pack is boiling.

1104
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,060
- We have fine weather today.
- Tell me about it.

1105
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,100
- Gosh.
- Let's huddle up.

1106
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,100
Let's move as a group.

1107
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,560
- I'm embarrassed by our outfits.
- Same here.

1108
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,470
- It's like we're dressed as a team.
- That's what people will think.

1109
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,910
- Director.
- Yes?

1110
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,680
- The guys won't listen to me.
- You were right all along.

1111
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,970
I called out the right direction,
but they ignored me twice.

1112
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,270
- They kept cutting me off.
- These boomers are killing me.

1113
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,310
I could tell that Jong Kook
was forcing himself to stay calm.

1114
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,680
- They won't listen though.
- Jong Kook was trembling.

1115
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,990
- They wouldn't listen to me.
- It's cold out here.

1116
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,680
- And it's cold.
- It's cold.

1117
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,060
It's freezing.

1118
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,700
Unbelievable.

1119
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,560
The map was misleading.

1120
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,290
We had too many back-seat drivers.

1121
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,060
You are to shut it,

1122
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,200
- and you are to sit up front.
- Yes, me.

1123
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,290
And Suk Jin should shut it.

1124
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,410
- I was right all along though.
- I mean it.

1125
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,040
You're sitting in the back
doing nothing,

1126
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,470
so why are you complaining?

1127
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,010
What's wrong about
enjoying the view?

1128
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,410
- I...
- I'll see how long this lasts.

1129
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,180
I'm right though.

1130
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,370
- Why did we need to rush it?
- Jong Kook.

1131
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,790
- You...
- Jae Suk, I...

1132
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,310
- Don't stress yourself out.
- I must say this though.

1133
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,740
But I was right all along.

1134
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,350
He just told Jong Kook
not to stress himself out.

1135
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,060
We got lost a while ago
because he took the wrong path.

1136
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,260
- Go back to selling sweet potatoes!
- Don't be ridiculous.

1137
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,930
- I'm saying I was right.
- Mister.

1138
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,890
- You weren't right about anything.
- You shouldn't sit next to me.

1139
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,490
- Se Chan should.
- I'll sit next to you.

1140
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,330
I need someone who can read the map.

1141
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,040
- I'm loving the breeze.
- It's freezing!

1142
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,410
- It's windy today.
- What now?

1143
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,040
This is the book cafe
on Mount Inwang...

1144
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,640
where you'll be first
delivering fall to the viewers.

1145
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,350
In accordance with your attire,

1146
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,040
those in summer clothes
will get iced coffee...

1147
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,770
while those in winter clothes
will get hot coffee.

1148
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:33,810
- Okay.
- Iced coffee?

1149
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,140
- Hot coffee?
- Enjoy your coffee and tea.

1150
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,660
I always drink iced coffee
even in winter.

1151
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,620
This looks delicious.

1152
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,950
- It's salt butter roll bread.
- Those are delicious.

1153
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,120
This looks great.

1154
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,350
- Thank you.
- Here.

1155
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,430
- Let's slice these.
- Chocolate.

1156
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,220
Step aside.

1157
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,540
(Driver Yoo is being childish.)

1158
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,600
- Haha.
- Yes?

1159
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,660
- One day, we'll turn the tables.
- I can't take this.

1160
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,410
- Let's come up with something.
- Jae Suk.

1161
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,700
Hey.

1162
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
- What?
- Don't eat it.

1163
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,370
It's not like you bought these.

1164
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,970
(It's not like you bought these.)

1165
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,520
- What?
- Watch your tone, young man.

1166
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,890
- You ungrateful...
- It's all right.

1167
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,410
Haha.

1168
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,310
Don't eat whatever I buy, then.

1169
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
One shouldn't be rude.

1170
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,080
The two are getting on my nerves.

1171
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,490
Unbelievable.

1172
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,390
- What the...
- Get over here.

1173
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,930
Don't eat anything from now on
since I'll be buying.

1174
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,700
I'll be buying from now on.

1175
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,640
Anyway, check out the fall scenery.

1176
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,740
(In awe)

1177
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,910
(He reacts at lightning speed.)

1178
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,600
Doesn't he get on your nerves?

1179
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,470
- He's incorrigible.
- That was quick, Jong Kook.

1180
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,350
I was thinking
the same thing, you see.

1181
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,680
- Your reaction...
- Was I...

1182
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,310
- Is this how I used to be?
- Yes.

1183
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,140
- Was I worse?
- This was you a few years back.

1184
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,680
Haha and Jong Kook...

1185
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,180
- aren't the same.
- Of course not.

1186
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,890
- He's more prudent.
- Exactly.

1187
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,060
(He's more prudent.)

1188
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,760
He doesn't say things lightly.

1189
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,850
(It's like Jae Suk's in love.)

1190
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,990
Right, Jong Kook?

1191
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,020
I don't agree to things
that are clearly wrong.

1192
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,620
Maybe I should appear
on your Youtube channel again.

1193
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,390
(Maybe I should appear
on your Youtube channel again.)

1194
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,560
(The blood pact was formed
when Jae Suk made his appearance.)

1195
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,870
We'll address the idea in December.

1196
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,040
(We'll address the idea
in December.)

1197
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,310
Gosh, Jae Suk.

1198
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,600
(Others suffer the most
when they get along.)

1199
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,370
- You two...
- This is the worst.

1200
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,770
There's no way out of this.
Haha, you should give up.

1201
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,120
- Them...
- Haha, admit your defeat.

1202
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,680
- That's in your best interest.
- This won't last though.

1203
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,950
- Haha, give up.
- They're playing with fire.

1204
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,660
Things got slightly dangerous
back in the van.

1205
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,450
- I saw it too.
- He was trembling.

1206
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,850
Jong Kook had his shoes off
and was trembling with annoyance.

1207
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,950
He was that furious.

1208
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,600
They're making this up.

1209
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,490
You shouldn't lie on TV, you know.

1210
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,140
- Did you see it or not?
- I saw it.

1211
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,740
- I definitely saw it.
- Don't lie on TV.

1212
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,890
- Haha...
- His right foot.

1213
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,930
- No, his left foot was up.
- When?

1214
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,930
- I saw it myself.
- He has a mole on his left foot.

1215
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,200
- Just give up, Haha.
- I never said such a thing.

1216
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,850
Here. Let's have one each.

1217
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,240
Hey.

1218
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,740
Can't you let us all have one
while you're at it?

1219
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,870
At this rate, you'll end up kissing.

1220
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,220
You know what?

1221
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,290
Keep at it.

1222
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,450
Being on his good side isn't so bad.

1223
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,760
- Let's get on with it, then.
- Here's your first mission.

1224
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,790
First, you will head downstairs...

1225
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,700
and ask three citizens who might have
good chemistry with you...

1226
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,660
to join you for this round.

1227
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,660
- Sure.
- Got it.

1228
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,220
- Okay.
- Right now?

1229
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,700
Three per person?

1230
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,240
- No, all together.
- Three all together?

1231
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
- Sure.
- Okay.

1232
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,140
We should ask if they're okay
with being on TV.

1233
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,910
- We must ask that.
- We'll ask them that.

1234
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

1235
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,410
- It's good to see you.
- Hello.

1236
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,540
- Hello.
- It's onion mayonnaise.

1237
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,350
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

1238
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,390
Would you mind
filming something with us?

1239
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,680
You're taller than you seem.

1240
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,890
- Me? Thank you.
- Yes.

1241
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,850
How would you like
to be on the show with us?

1242
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,660
- What do you say?
- I'd like that.

1243
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,160
Jae Suk, he agreed to it.

1244
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,990
Really? Could you join us?

1245
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,990
Where though?

1246
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,220
- Upstairs.
- Sure.

1247
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,290
- That's one.
- And...

1248
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,700
- We need two more.
- Right.

1249
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,060
- So Min and Ji Hyo.
- How about that gentleman?

1250
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,470
Right, him.

1251
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,640
Sir, could you...

1252
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,600
If you're free, would you mind
sparing us some of your time?

1253
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,370
Could you join us
for a chat upstairs?

1254
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,680
- If you don't mind, that is.
- Right.

1255
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,950
- What do you say?
- Shall we?

1256
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,240
- Thank you.
- Let's go, then.

1257
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,370
- We need one more.
- It won't take long.

1258
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,290
Who else would like to chat with us?

1259
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,020
Is that so?

1260
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,850
Could you spare us some time?

1261
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,310
What do you say?

1262
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,560
She has the time.

1263
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,120
- Really?
- She has the time.

1264
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,430
Please join us, then.

1265
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,100
Guys, come with us.

1266
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,830
- Shall we?
- Let's head upstairs.

1267
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,270
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1268
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,390
- Do you like being on TV?
- Yes, what is this for?

1269
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,370
She must be representing her group.

1270
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,560
Will they go up against
the Empty Heads?

1271
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,680
They must be going up against
the Empty Heads.

1272
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,010
The Empty Heads? That's me.

1273
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,180
You can sit over here.

1274
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,080
First of all, could you
briefly introduce yourselves?

1275
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,470
I retired after being
in public service...

1276
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,680
and am now working
as an apartment complex manager.

1277
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,120
- He's a manager.
- Welcome.

1278
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,220
- After being in public service...
- I retired.

1279
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,390
When did you retire?

1280
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,560
At the end of last year.

1281
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,520
- Congratulations.
- How commendable.

1282
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,330
- That was hard work.
- Good job, sir.

1283
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,470
Could you also tell us who you are?

1284
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,660
I am a mother of two.
A son and a daughter.

1285
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,830
What?

1286
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,160
- A son and a daughter?
- I thought she was in high school.

1287
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,140
- Me too.
- Exactly.

1288
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,100
I was wondering
why she wasn't in school.

1289
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,770
How old are your children?

1290
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,850
They're on the older side.
5th grade and 3rd grade.

1291
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,410
- No way.
- Seriously?

1292
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,640
- I would've never guessed it.
- I look young for my age.

1293
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,740
Your children must
watch Running Man.

1294
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,680
Yes, they love the show.
I wasn't keen on coming up here,

1295
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,660
but I did it for my son.

1296
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,560
- That's why you joined us.
- He would love it.

1297
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,330
Sir, may I ask you your name?

1298
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,720
- I'm from Gyeonggi Province.
- Right.

1299
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,200
The name is Jung Min Woo.

1300
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,470
And I own a book store.

1301
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,520
- My gosh.
- A book store?

1302
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,890
A book store?
You must read a lot of books.

1303
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,240
No, I just like books in general.

1304
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,510
Right, books.

1305
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,970
All three have this energy in them.

1306
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,430
- I sense that too.
- It's different.

1307
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,580
They'll be tough competition.

1308
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,010
- I'll explain the game.
- Sure.

1309
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,370
You'll be competing
with the citizens today...

1310
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,080
in the 3-on-3 Running Man Quiz.

1311
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,680
- Against those three.
- But this...

1312
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,680
Considering their age,
they'll be knowledgeable.

1313
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,760
The three citizens...

1314
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,850
and three from the Running Man team
will write down their answers.

1315
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,260
The team with
the most correct answers...

1316
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,660
- will win the round.
- Okay.

1317
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,330
If Running Man wins
more than five rounds,

1318
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,600
you will all obtain fall clothes.

1319
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,740
- Let's do it.
- It'll be nearly impossible though.

1320
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,930
- You'll get off work right away.
- Right away?

1321
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
In other cases,
you will obtain clothes...

1322
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,640
depending on how well you did.

1323
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,010
- It's not a bad deal.
- Got it.

1324
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,540
First,

1325
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,680
Jae Suk, Suk Jin,
and So Min are up.

1326
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,080
Must we all answer correctly?

1327
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,140
- No, more than...
- You just have to do better.

1328
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,540
- Better than them.
- Got it.

1329
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,950
Consider So Min as a loss
and get it right yourselves.

1330
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,310
So Min's not so bad.

1331
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,580
Of course. She's gotten better.

1332
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,810
What is Mount Inwang again?

1333
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,290
She sometimes surprises us
by knowing things we don't.

1334
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,600
Exactly.
Also, you sometimes forget the answer.

1335
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,220
Even if you know the answer,

1336
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,060
your mind could draw a blank.

1337
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,330
Hold on. I can see
their sketchbooks from here.

1338
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,870
- Like this.
- You shouldn't be able to.

1339
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,700
- There you go.
- How can you know if it's right?

1340
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,740
- Right.
- Of course.

1341
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,660
They might look at ours and cheat,

1342
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,430
- so we'll hold ours up.
- Exactly.

1343
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,180
- We can't take any chances.
- Good going.

1344
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,040
- Here we go.
- Sure.

1345
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,720
What is the full name
of the novelist...

1346
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:48,520
who wrote "The Old Man and the Sea"
and won the Nobel Prize?

1347
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,890
- His full name?
- His full name?

1348
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,330
(Mr. Lee writes it down
the second he hears the question.)

1349
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,430
I'm clueless.

1350
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,100
(Mr. Lee writes it down
the second he hears the question.)

1351
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,560
- His full name?
- His full name?

1352
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,990
(As always,
So Min isn't considered a contender.)

1353
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,490
He wrote something down.

1354
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,930
You should know that
he didn't even hesitate.

1355
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,100
- That's true.
- As soon as he heard it...

1356
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,270
I think that's it.

1357
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,410
It's hard to know the full name.

1358
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,700
Yes, it is on the trickier side.
I'm not sure if mine is right.

1359
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,870
I can't be sure.

1360
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,290
- Is there more to his name?
- Don't look.

1361
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,850
- Is this right?
- He didn't hesitate.

1362
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,060
(Seok Sam writes something down
with gloved hands.)

1363
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,310
- Isn't it this?
- I think it is.

1364
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,020
- So Min.
- I think he's right.

1365
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,580
- Is this it?
- I think so.

1366
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,390
- I'm not sure of mine.
- Hold it up on three.

1367
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,430
- I think it's right.
- Really?

1368
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,990
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Is this right?

1369
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,520
- What...
- Ernest.

1370
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,830
- Right, Ernest.
- I wrote "August."

1371
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,770
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Is this right?

1372
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,240
(He withdrew himself from the game.)

1373
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,680
- "Ernest."
- I thought it was "August."

1374
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,770
- Wait. Who is it?
- Ernest Hemingway.

1375
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,720
It's Ernest Hemingway.
Both got it right.

1376
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,990
It's 1 to 1,
so this round is invalid.

1377
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,080
- It's a tie.
- It's invalid, right?

1378
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,120
It's a tie.

1379
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,890
- I thought it was August.
- Do you not read many books?

1380
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:58,330
- He's running a bookstore.
- He's running a bookstore.

1381
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,260
He's running a bookstore.

1382
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,430
Sir.

1383
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,560
- Ernest Hemingway.
- You're highly knowledge.

1384
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,370
Don't you have to say
"highly knowledgeable?"

1385
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,970
- Highly knowledgeable.
- Highly knowledgeable.

1386
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,660
What do you mean
he's "highly knowledge?"

1387
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,410
I just got one word wrong.

1388
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,100
- I thought it was August.
- By the way...

1389
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,450
your children might watch
Running Man.

1390
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,410
I'm in trouble.

1391
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,020
You don't have to be embarrassed
about not knowing this.

1392
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,720
It was cute though.

1393
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,080
It's a good thing
that she's wearing a mask.

1394
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,390
Why do you say that?

1395
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,560
It was on purpose.

1396
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,620
Jiroro, why do you say that?

1397
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,830
(Before the battle began)

1398
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,160
Thank you for doing this with us.

1399
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,290
You can take off your mask now.

1400
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,890
Can't I keep it on?

1401
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,160
- You can wear it.
- I'll wear it then.

1402
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,870
- If that's comfortable.
- Do what's comfortable for you.

1403
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,140
(She foresaw it
and decided to keep it on.)

1404
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,010
Jiroro, why do you say that?

1405
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,510
No, I mean... there's nothing
embarrassing about getting it wrong.

1406
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,640
- Don't worry.
- I got it wrong too.

1407
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,970
I'll give you the next question.

1408
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,950
It's the world's oldest extant book
printed with movable metal type.

1409
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,350
What's Korea's first metalloid type
added...

1410
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,720
to UNESCO's Memory of the World?

1411
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,080
- The metalloid type?
- Type?

1412
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,080
- It's the metalloid type.
- Hold on.

1413
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,660
The first metalloid type.

1414
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,930
(The manager immediately writes
this time again.)

1415
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,120
- It's no joke.
- He's incredible.

1416
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,520
- Oh, no. It might not be right.
- He was a public official.

1417
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,930
- Wait. I...
- Gosh.

1418
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,330
(Meanwhile, the challengers
are contemplating again.)

1419
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,140
Is this not metal?

1420
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,040
He was a public official.

1421
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,270
Wait. I know this.

1422
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,270
- Excuse me.
- I...

1423
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,540
He might've worked hard.

1424
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,600
Did Jae Suk write the answer?

1425
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,410
I'm not sure if it's correct.

1426
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,080
Are you not going to tell us
how many letters it is?

1427
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,620
"Metal type" is hard.

1428
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,120
- Metal printed?
- "Metal type" is hard.

1429
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,760
- This is amazing.
- I've never heard of it.

1430
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,220
- Yes. This one.
- Reveal your answer.

1431
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,950
- Yes. Reveal it now.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1432
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,930
I don't know. It's Jikji.

1433
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:39,620
It's Jikji. That's right.

1434
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,620
(The answer is Jikji.)

1435
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,470
(Seok Sam got it right as well.)

1436
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,540
- He...
- Tripitaka Koreana.

1437
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,330
- I wrote Tripitaka Koreana.
- It's fine.

1438
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,970
- It's Jikji.
- I don't know.

1439
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,160
- I couldn't write my answer.
- He...

1440
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,040
- I should've not done this.
- It's okay.

1441
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,740
The answer is Jikji.

1442
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,200
- I'm right.
- Right.

1443
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,370
- Old Man.
- Yes.

1444
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,350
- As expected.
- Suk Jin got it right though.

1445
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,520
I got it right.

1446
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,180
You majored in Business
at Ajou University.

1447
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,080
- I know this much.
- You studied Economy.

1448
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,890
You got everything right.

1449
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,790
- Sir.
- I only know this much.

1450
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:08,790
(The manager's answers
were 100 percent correct.)

1451
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:09,990
You're amazing.

1452
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,020
- Let's switch the members.
- It's Jikji.

1453
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,290
Jong Kook, Haha, and Jae Suk
will do it.

1454
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,430
- What?
- Is it over?

1455
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,120
Old Man.

1456
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,770
- Old Man?
- Old Man is good as expected.

1457
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,410
By the way, I think
you're not even trying now.

1458
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:24,510
I'm sorry, but you two...

1459
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,510
I'm so sorry to make you do this.

1460
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,680
- But it's fine.
- It's okay. It's a good memory.

1461
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,180
If only you didn't tell
your profession...

1462
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,240
- He's running a bookstore.
- He's running a bookstore.

1463
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,290
But even the owner of a bookstore
won't know everything.

1464
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,580
- Right.
- True.

1465
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,930
He would know everything
about books though.

1466
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,350
Of course. Let's go.

1467
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,390
A class system in India that divides
people into four main categories...

1468
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,390
based on their profession.
What is this?

1469
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,870
Don't let them see it.

1470
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:57,140
(The class system in India that
divides people into 4 categories?)

1471
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,700
(However)

1472
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,140
- He's stuck.
- Good.

1473
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,970
- Finally.
- It's his first time contemplating.

1474
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,310
- I wrote it.
- We can win.

1475
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,350
- Did you write it?
- I wrote it right away.

1476
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,220
Please reveal your answer.

1477
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,640
- Okay.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1478
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,720
It has five letters?

1479
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,620
- Isn't it caste?
- The caste system.

1480
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,660
- In 1, 2, 3.
- It has five letters?

1481
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,120
- Oh, right.
- Isn't it caste?

1482
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,660
(Everyone in Team Citizens gave up.)

1483
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,760
- I couldn't write an answer.
- Okay.

1484
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,060
- We all got it right.
- We all got it right.

1485
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,430
We all got it right.

1486
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,600
- Haha, you too.
- Did you see that, So Min?

1487
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,990
- You're cool.
- Yes.

1488
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,200
- I should not...
- It's a good memory.

1489
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,430
- I should've not come here.
- Don't worry.

1490
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,580
It's fine.

1491
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,770
Honestly, you've sighed
watching us Empty Heads...

1492
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:35,600
on TV, right?

1493
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,100
I did sigh.

1494
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,240
- Right?
- "How..."

1495
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,080
- You were frustrated, right?
- "How can they not know it?"

1496
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,040
- The questions are hard today.
- It's difficult today.

1497
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,950
(They were so bright before.)

1498
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,490
(A special measure
for those who lost energy)

1499
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,350
- Did you see that?
- Let's switch for the last time.

1500
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,850
Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and So Min.

1501
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:53,850
- Me?
- Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and So Min.

1502
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:54,870
- We're in trouble.
- Me again?

1503
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:55,870
Go.

1504
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,200
- You guys...
- Give us easy questions,

1505
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,890
but say that they're difficult.
Okay?

1506
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,010
(A chance like this won't come again
for Team Citizens.)

1507
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,830
- I should write something at least.
- You should write one at least.

1508
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,310
I don't think
I would write anything.

1509
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:09,310
It's okay.

1510
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,140
- I'll give you a question.
- It's difficult.

1511
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,040
It's a research institute set up by
Sejong the Great...

1512
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,810
- I know this much.
- of the Joseon Dynasty...

1513
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:18,850
- to create Hangul. What is this?
- It's easy.

1514
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,450
- You guys should be quiet.
- Be quiet.

1515
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,720
- They can see it.
- I can't see it.

1516
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,950
- Put it up and write.
- Hold it up.

1517
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,120
- I'll block it like this.
- Hold it up.

1518
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,430
- Yes. Hold it up.
- There you go.

1519
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:28,970
This is a little...

1520
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,220
Is this right?
I wrote something at least.

1521
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,330
Hold it up.

1522
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,060
- Do you not know it?
- I don't know.

1523
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,470
This is a little...

1524
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:39,040
(It seems they wrote something
as well.)

1525
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,470
Okay. This is a little...

1526
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,040
- Isn't it the answer?
- Hold it up on the count of three.

1527
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,540
- Is this correct?
- In 1, 2, 3.

1528
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,640
- This is not correct, is it?
- Let me see.

1529
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,810
- It's not Sungkyunkwan.
- Oh, my.

1530
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,390
- Is this correct?
- In 1, 2, 3.

1531
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,260
(Sungkyunkwan)

1532
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,890
(Many of them wrote Sungkyunkwan.)

1533
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,180
It's Jiphyeonjeon.

1534
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:57,930
- What's "Cheonmunkwan?"
- "Cheonmunkwan?"

1535
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,660
- Isn't it Sungkyunkwan?
- "Cheonmun..."

1536
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:01,890
Team Citizens won.

1537
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,560
What's "Cheonmunkwan?"

1538
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,640
- The answer is Jiphyeonjeon.
- Jiphyeonjeon.

1539
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,700
Sungkyunkwan.

1540
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,160
It's Jiphyeonjeon.

1541
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,240
What's Sungkyunkwan then?

1542
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,310
- It's where they teach students.
- It's an educational institute.

1543
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,970
It's a university.

1544
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,270
You know Sungkyunkwan University.

1545
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,080
(Laughing)

1546
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,240
Thank you for writing
the same answer as me.

1547
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,240
I feel good.

1548
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,520
- It's a relief.
- I thought someone would write it.

1549
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,950
Wait. Doesn't it seem
like they saw each other's answer?

1550
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:26,990
I didn't see it.

1551
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,350
I covered it while writing it.

1552
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,680
- Just in case,
- Yes.

1553
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,890
can you ask what they do again?

1554
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:35,430
- Should we film it again?
- Let's film it again.

1555
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,100
- Because...
- It's for him.

1556
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,640
For both of them,
even if they learned it at school,

1557
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,330
They might not remember it.

1558
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,640
You can't remember it well.

1559
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,010
Do you want me to give you a mask?
It's not too late.

1560
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,100
It's okay. All right.

1561
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,640
I'll give you another question.

1562
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:54,080
What's the name of Korea's first country
founded by Dangun Wanggeom?

1563
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,140
- You would know this.
- The level of the question is...

1564
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,080
- It's Korea's first country.
- Yes.

1565
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,410
- This is so...
- You can do it.

1566
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:01,120
I know this.

1567
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,930
You should know this.

1568
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,200
I can only think of Hongik Ingan.

1569
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,890
Isn't it three letters?

1570
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,220
- Then I think this is right.
- You can't say it.

1571
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,700
(Se Chan knows the answer as well?)

1572
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,060
(Surprised)

1573
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,600
The first country.

1574
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,200
It's that one.

1575
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,680
I can't remember it.

1576
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,740
- I wrote something. Just write.
- I can't remember it.

1577
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:30,310
Reveal it on the count of three.

1578
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,870
In 1, 2, 3.

1579
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,040
(The answer is Gojoseon.)

1580
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,770
- Goguryeo.
- I wrote Goguryeo too.

1581
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,490
- It's Gojoseon.
- It's Gojoseon.

1582
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:39,990
- "Goguryoe."
- "Hongik Ingan."

1583
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,020
"Hongik Ingan."

1584
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,390
It means "to broadly benefit
the human world."

1585
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,180
- That's what Dangun said.
- She said it was a country.

1586
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,620
"Gojoseon."

1587
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,720
It's Gojoseon.

1588
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,200
They all got it right.

1589
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,520
(Everyone in Team Citizens
got it right.)

1590
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,100
- I got one right.
- Congratulations.

1591
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,390
- I got it right.
- Congratulations.

1592
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,140
Oh, my, the owner of the bookstore.

1593
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,830
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1594
00:51:58,830 --> 00:51:59,930
Congratulations.

1595
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,430
- Congratulations.
- I'm happy for them.

1596
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,200
- Congratulations.
- It's not an easy question.

1597
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,450
What's your name?

1598
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,100
Kim Kyung Hee.

1599
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:12,410
Kyung Hee's children
watch Running Man.

1600
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:16,490
She can tell them to study only when
she got the question right.

1601
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,750
If they say, "You got them all wrong,"
she has no words to say.

1602
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,290
- She got Gojoseon right.
- I'm happy for you, Kyung Hee.

1603
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,890
This is the last question.

1604
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,770
You can pick the members
you want this time.

1605
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,870
- Us three.
- The best trio.

1606
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,330
- Let's go.
- We should let the best ones go.

1607
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:30,390
I...

1608
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,000
- If we get one question right...
- We're good.

1609
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,640
- We can get clothes.
- Two pieces of clothing.

1610
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,640
We got this.

1611
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,080
This is the last question.

1612
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,270
What's the color of the ring
on the archery target for ten?

1613
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:41,640
- This is so easy.
- They would know it.

1614
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,080
(What's the color of the ring
on the archery target for 10?)

1615
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,750
(The manager writes 1st
as expected.)

1616
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,250
- Is it this one?
- It's so easy.

1617
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,620
- It's that one.
- It's that one, right?

1618
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,410
The commentators...

1619
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,620
I know.

1620
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,680
(As they try to think,
they can't remember it clearly.)

1621
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,790
I think it's this one.

1622
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,720
I'm confused as I have to write it.

1623
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,160
- I think it's this one.
- So we should write the color?

1624
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,520
- Not the name.
- The color?

1625
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,430
No. Wait. "Not the name?"

1626
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,790
- No. It's the color.
- The color.

1627
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,470
- The commentators say the name.
- No.

1628
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:07,770
- It's not that one?
- You should write the color.

1629
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:08,810
- Oh, yes?
- "Ten."

1630
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,970
(What's the color of the ring
on the archery target for "ten?")

1631
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,470
- Let's go.
- He always acts like he knows.

1632
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:14,370
In 1, 2, 3.

1633
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,370
(They reveal their answer
for the last question.)

1634
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,750
- Yellow?
- Red.

1635
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,680
- Is it black?
- In 1, 2, 3.

1636
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,810
- Yellow?
- Red.

1637
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:24,350
(Yellow, red, black)

1638
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:29,290
(What's the color of the ring
on the archery target for 10?)

1639
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:30,450
- It's yellow.
- It's red.

1640
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,270
- Is it black?
- The correct answer is yellow.

1641
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,500
(The answer is yellow.)

1642
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,870
(For Team Citizens,
only the ace got it right.)

1643
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,430
- It's yellow.
- Team Running Man...

1644
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:41,310
- won.
- We won.

1645
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:44,180
As such, you earned two outfits.

1646
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,810
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

1647
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:47,870
Thank you.

1648
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:50,640
For those who participated,
we'll give bookstore gift certificates.

1649
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,140
That's nice!

1650
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,450
- My goodness.
- As expected.

1651
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:55,810
A bookstore gift certificate
to a bookstore owner.

1652
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,220
- Here you go, Kyung Hee.
- Thank you.

1653
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,430
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

1654
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,430
Thank you.

1655
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,890
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1656
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:01,930
- See you, Kyung Hee.
- See you.

1657
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,600
- Thank you.
- See you.

1658
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,120
Two autumn outfits are given.

1659
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,870
- Who is going to wear it?
- The member who will wear it...

1660
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,040
will be decided by you guys.

1661
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,290
How can we decide it?

1662
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,140
- We should do rock-paper-scissors.
- We should.

1663
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,160
- It can't be helped.
- But they must be cold.

1664
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,140
- What about us?
- They must be trembling.

1665
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,810
Then you should be exempted.
Let's play among ourselves.

1666
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,950
- Ji Hyo should win one.
- No.

1667
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,310
- So Min is cold too.
- I'm fine.

1668
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:26,490
Since that's what Jae Suk wants,
let's follow him.

1669
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:29,060
No! I want to play
rock-paper-scissors.

1670
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,450
- No.
- I don't want to play it...

1671
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:31,850
now that
you're telling us what to do.

1672
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,790
- We should play first...
- We should win.

1673
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:36,020
- and give it to them when we win.
- No, let's not give them.

1674
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,930
- Okay.
- We can give one to Ji Hyo,

1675
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,930
- not So Min.
- Don't give it to me.

1676
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:41,290
- Also, this is scissors.
- No.

1677
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:42,660
No, that's paper.

1678
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,560
- This is paper.
- Why would you play?

1679
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,770
Why not? I can play.

1680
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:47,430
- Move, Suk Jin.
- Why are you being like this?

1681
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:48,830
We're all playing.

1682
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,540
- I'm okay.
- I'll give you a map...

1683
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,600
to the second spot.

1684
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,850
- Okay!
- Come to the back, Suk Jin.

1685
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,640
- Come to the back, Suk Jin.
- Why?

1686
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,970
You should come to the back.

1687
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,080
Se Chan, lead the way.

1688
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,250
I'm in the passenger seat.

1689
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,520
- Okay, you should sit there.
- Of course.

1690
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,310
This is the place, guys.

1691
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,950
It's Chungmuro. You should drive
toward Myeong-dong.

1692
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:08,500
- Hey.
- Myeong-dong.

1693
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,950
I can even keep my eyes closed
to find my way around Chungmuro.

1694
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,000
You're at it again.

1695
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,770
I got it!
I'll go to Chungmuro Station first.

1696
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:20,270
- Okay.
- Drive toward Myeong-dong.

1697
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,200
I used to walk there...

1698
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,850
- from Jongno.
- Okay. I got it.

1699
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:27,870
Let's see how well you do.

1700
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,810
Suk Jin,
Chungmuro and Myeong-dong...

1701
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,680
are my hometown
from my college days.

1702
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,080
We're having ribs in soup for lunch.

1703
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,350
- What's ribs in soup?
- What is it?

1704
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,750
It's soupy ribs.

1705
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,250
Like bulgogi.

1706
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,520
- GPS Ssaeb.
- To go to Myeong-dong,

1707
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,390
- We're going to Myeong-dong?
- we should go this way.

1708
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,220
Suk Jin, be careful with what you say.
You might be kicked out.

1709
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,430
- What do you mean?
- Also...

1710
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,430
When it comes to directions,

1711
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,930
everyone except Jong Kook,
Se Chan, and I should shut it.

1712
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,640
- Is Se Chan that good?
- Who are you to say that?

1713
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,140
- Shut it!
- What's with Se Chan?

1714
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,430
They don't know the way.

1715
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,350
He won't listen to you anyway,
GPS Ssaeb.

1716
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,470
Mister.

1717
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,310
- Mister.
- Who are you calling? Me?

1718
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:04,770
Yes. If you keep behaving like that,

1719
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,410
I'll drop you
at Gyeongbokgung Station.

1720
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,950
How can you say that?

1721
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,580
- Also...
- He said he could get off.

1722
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,160
I've been living in Seoul
for 50 years.

1723
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,250
- What about me, then?
- Then we should trust him.

1724
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,850
You came to Seoul
from your hometown.

1725
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,930
I was here since I was three.

1726
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:19,560
- Did you walk up to Seoul?
- I was three then.

1727
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,500
If you didn't,
then you should keep quiet.

1728
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,830
- I wonder how he climbed up.
- I walked around...

1729
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:23,870
every part of Seoul.

1730
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:26,410
How could you have climbed up
when you were just three?

1731
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,540
- On a sightseeing bus.
- Stay still.

1732
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,600
Did you buy the tickets yourself?

1733
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,350
Gosh, you're adding on to this?

1734
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,080
You always scold me.

1735
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,370
People in this industry
do that sometimes.

1736
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,990
Why do you always scold me?

1737
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:41,750
Gosh, the hand warmer is so hot.
This is infuriating!

1738
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,160
- Why won't this window open?
- It's cold. Don't open it.

1739
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,790
- It's cold.
- It's cold. Don't open it.

1740
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,620
- It's not cold.
- Come on, Suk Jin.

1741
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,930
Let's open the windows.
It's up to me.

1742
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,330
From there,

1743
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,520
take a U-turn.

1744
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,060
Then turn right.

1745
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,660
You're heading
toward City Hall, right?

1746
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,020
We should go toward City Hall
from here.

1747
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,930
Right, we should turn right
from here.

1748
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:58,560
Guys, we're heading to City Hall.

1749
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,540
- Se Chan.
- Yes.

1750
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,240
Let me put it this way.
Now that Se Chan is sitting next to me,

1751
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,450
I realized that only one Sherpa
was needed to climb the Himalayas.

1752
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,250
This is how it should be done.

1753
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,080
- You see? I'm still holding it.
- The Sherpa.

1754
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,450
- This is what the Sherpa does.
- I can see his future.

1755
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:13,950
- I can see his future.
- His attitude is different.

1756
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:16,080
I can see him getting off the car.

1757
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,250
- But the thing is...
- Be careful with what you say.

1758
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,990
I can see him getting off
while spitting.

1759
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,120
Try stopping him.

1760
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,720
Jae Suk's comparison is nice.
The Sherpa.

1761
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,750
- Hey.
- The Sherpa.

1762
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,330
Do you like living like a rat?

1763
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,870
- Yes, it is.
- You're sucking up to him.

1764
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,430
How can you call him that?

1765
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,930
Don't call him a rat
when he's working hard.

1766
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:32,810
- We can't go this way.
- Okay.

1767
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:35,140
- You should've gone to the right.
- No, we can U-turn.

1768
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,600
(The way they should've taken)

1769
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,810
- No, we can U-turn.
- I should've gone to the right.

1770
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,140
I know. But you can't do that here.

1771
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,250
How far will you go to U-turn?

1772
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,720
- The lane won't allow us.
- The lane won't allow us.

1773
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,410
We can't break the law.

1774
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:48,520
Se Chan, why didn't you tell him
in advance?

1775
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,580
Pull yourself together.

1776
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,580
Why didn't you tell him in advance?
We have to make a detour.

1777
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,850
No, we're going in the right way.

1778
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:55,250
Leave the directions to him.

1779
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,560
Let's talk
about something productive.

1780
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,200
Also, you should enjoy this.

1781
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,430
We should be able...

1782
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:02,040
- to talk about various topics.
- It couldn't be helped.

1783
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,930
We should've taken the other road.

1784
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,240
Let's talk about various topics.

1785
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,200
- What? You should pull over.
- What?

1786
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,930
(The police are controlling
the traffic.)

1787
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:11,680
What happened?
I didn't do anything wrong.

1788
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,500
No, it's all right.

1789
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,580
(Bursting into laughter)

1790
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,750
Why were you intimidated?

1791
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,450
- Hey! The police officer...
- Why...

1792
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,850
told me to pull over.

1793
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,160
- Were you scared?
- I didn't do anything wrong.

1794
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,580
"What happened?"

1795
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,620
(Getting cold feet)

1796
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,750
You got intimidated.

1797
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,290
- Gosh, it's so hot.
- You got intimidated.

1798
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,970
Gosh, this is no joke. Hey.

1799
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,200
What do I do?

1800
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,390
You're banned from saying
you're hot.

1801
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:37,660
Next time,
I should wear a fall outfit.

1802
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,930
- Why? Because you're hot?
- The hand warmer...

1803
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,140
- It's up to you.
- I bet you're hot.

1804
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,700
The hand warmer is crazy hot.
And I'm wearing a hat too.

1805
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,450
You're the eldest here.
You should be charismatic.

1806
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:48,500
- Charisma?
- You should be charismatic.

1807
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,970
- Nothing I say would work.
- Charisma.

1808
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:52,750
Those are rascals.

1809
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,810
- Should we exit here?
- Let's do that.

1810
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:56,990
- Let's exit.
- You can change the lane now.

1811
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:59,580
We'll exit now
and take the underpass.

1812
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:00,580
Sounds good.

1813
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,720
- I'm upset too.
- Hey.

1814
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,430
- We should exit now.
- Here?

1815
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,600
- Why didn't you exit?
- It was a solid line.

1816
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,330
- What are you guys doing?
- Keep quiet.

1817
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:10,770
- We had to take this lane anyway.
- What are you guys doing?

1818
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,660
- We had to take this lane anyway.
- Where are you going?

1819
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,200
Hey, how far are you going
to U-turn?

1820
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,410
Wait a minute.

1821
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:19,310
Jae Suk doesn't listen at all.

1822
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:20,750
He just goes straight.

1823
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,750
It was a solid line.

1824
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,450
What? Why are you going this way?

1825
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,520
We're going this way
toward Seodaemun Gate.

1826
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,810
That's right, we are.

1827
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,160
Do you know where we are going?
Tell us.

1828
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,250
Let me be honest.

1829
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,080
We are taking a detour.

1830
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,180
We should've exited earlier.

1831
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,120
- But we can come back to Sinchon.
- That's right.

1832
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,930
I mean, are we going to be
on the road the whole day?

1833
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,240
- As long as we get there.
- But we are doing this...

1834
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,930
to learn how inconvenient it was
before we had GPS.

1835
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:48,240
But we could've gone the right way.
We're going around too much.

1836
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,600
Gosh, why did they make him...

1837
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,970
- decide the rules?
- Is this car yours?

1838
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,770
- She's right. Is the car yours?
- Is this car yours?

1839
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:56,080
If you have complaints,
then get off.

1840
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,080
Why would I get off?

1841
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,410
- Why would I?
- Why should we? You get off.

1842
00:59:58,410 --> 00:59:59,410
Is this your car?

1843
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:01,140
The thing is,

1844
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,660
it's only right to let
the driver decide everything.

1845
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,750
- That's right. I have control.
- We should trust him.

1846
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,850
Then let's change the driver.

1847
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:10,290
Then you should drive.
Do you have Class One license?

1848
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,220
- He must not have one.
- You need that to drive this?

1849
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,390
We need Class One license?

1850
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:15,660
- Yes, we do.
- Mine is Class One.

1851
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:17,540
He must not have Class One license.

1852
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,640
You can drive up to nine people.

59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,199
- He came on strong.
- He was like... I know.

1853
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,430
He doesn't even have
Class One license.

1854
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,430
His must be Class Two.

1855
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,450
Check his license...

1856
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,080
- if it's Class 1 or Class 2.
- That little guy.

1857
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,080
- Even his car is small.
- He can only ride a small one.

1858
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,140
- It's Class 2.
- It's Class 2?

1859
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,080
It's Class Two, small.

1860
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,250
Yours is Class Two, small?

1861
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,450
- It's not even regular?
- You can't even drive a stick?

1862
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:38,830
I have a license for motorcycles.

1863
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:40,450
What use is that?

1864
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:43,220
- For motorized vehicles?
- You don't even ride motorbikes.

1865
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,600
I can't because I'm scared.

1866
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,930
- Exactly.
- I'm afraid I'd die.

1867
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,970
- That's not it.
- Listen. Two, four...

1868
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,660
Hey. Wait a minute.

1869
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:51,040
What is it?

1870
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,330
Is this our staff's car?
Can we follow it?

1871
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,540
Jae Suk, no.
Don't follow the car in front of you.

1872
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,140
- What is that?
- Go straight and U-turn there.

1873
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:02,040
- Right. I should U-turn there.
- Then you'll go this way.

1874
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,970
- But we have to take a long way.
- What is this?

1875
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,040
What are you doing?
We're going the opposite way.

1876
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,790
- There's no place for us to U-turn.
- How frustrating.

1877
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,660
- We are...
- Should we break the law then?

1878
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,350
We can't break the law, can we?

1879
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:15,080
GPS Ssaeb, what's the point
of being in the passenger seat?

1880
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,830
Gosh, this is where we did
our opening.

1881
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:20,720
- How nice.
- This reminds me of the opening.

1882
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,700
Guys, can't you just enjoy
the weather?

1883
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,330
- That's right!
- Why are you so strict?

1884
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:26,930
Be more relaxed, will you?

1885
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:27,930
Gosh, it's so hot.

1886
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:30,540
GPS Ssaeb, what are you doing?

1887
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,830
Gosh, it's hot.

1888
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,410
(Bursting into laughter)

1889
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,580
Suk Jin, have some iced coffee.

1890
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,790
- They won't allow me to.
- He can't have it.

1891
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:41,890
Gosh, this is crazy. I'm boiled up.

1892
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:45,250
I touched his gloves earlier,
and they were wet with his sweat.

1893
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,620
It's hot in the afternoon.

1894
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,790
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.
It's so hot.

1895
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,660
- What is it?
- Suk Jin says he's hot.

1896
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,200
Whatever! I'll take it off.

1897
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,870
- Suk Jin.
- Whatever!

1898
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,330
Report it to Hyung In.

1899
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:59,930
Hyung In, he took off his hat.
Report it to Hyung In.

1900
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:01,560
(Suk Jin puts it back on quickly.)

1901
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,740
No, did you see it?
You didn't take a photo.

1902
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,410
It was all caught on camera.

1903
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,500
- It was all caught on camera.
- Seriously. It was all caught,

1904
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,810
but he was like, "Did you see it?"

1905
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,970
The old idol singers, like H.O.T...

1906
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,350
- Gosh, it's hot.
- They went this far?

1907
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:15,080
- Yes, here.
- Why did they come this far?

1908
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,450
Gosh, we're going around too much.

1909
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,160
You need to focus here.

1910
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,430
- From here...
- Be quiet, everyone!

1911
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:22,250
If we go straight, it's Jongno.

1912
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,500
If we go to the right,
it's Namdaemun,

1913
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,620
which is really close to Chungmuro.

1914
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,830
All right. Sounds good.
We're going toward Namdaemun?

1915
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,060
We're going straight to Chungmuro
from there.

1916
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,060
Okay.

1917
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,600
Isn't that where Daehan Cinema is?

1918
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,810
- Stay still, mister!
- Seriously!

1919
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:34,330
Don't talk to me.
I'm very edgy right now.

1920
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,240
If you go straight
from Namsan First Tunnel...

1921
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,310
Stay still.

1922
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:39,600
Why does he show off so much
whenever he has a chance?

1923
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,600
It's not that. I just know
the way around there.

1924
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,310
I know it so well.
I don't even need a GPS.

1925
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:47,040
Suk Jin, I used to study
around this area.

1926
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,640
- You studied around here too?
- Of course.

1927
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,810
Gosh, then you should know
the way around here.

1928
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,250
Jong Kook is so different
toward Jae Suk.

1929
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,160
Why would Jong Kook react like that
when he said he just studied here?

1930
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,180
It's a fun story, that's why!

1931
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,330
- Hey.
- Of course!

1932
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:58,390
Jong Kook, you sound so different
when you talk to Jae Suk.

1933
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,560
- What's with you guys?
- Go ahead, Jae Suk.

1934
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,240
Let me tell you the story.

1935
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,640
You are all in a group chat
without me, right?

1936
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,870
That's true.

1937
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:08,640
Jae Suk is sharing his story.

1938
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,140
I'm sharing a story here,
which is rare.

1939
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,770
All right. Go ahead.

1940
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:14,950
It may be gone now,

1941
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:16,620
but there used to be
an academy around here.

1942
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:19,680
It was around Donam-dong
near Suyu-ri.

1943
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,220
That's where my high school
and my house were.

1944
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,450
There was an academy near my place,

1945
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:24,660
- but I chose...
- Chose?

1946
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,520
to go to an academy here
which took me an hour and a half.

1947
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,660
- Why?
- What's the reason?

1948
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:28,850
- Because...
- Because they're good?

1949
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:31,330
That's one thing, but there were...

1950
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,830
many pretty girls in this academy.

1951
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:33,830
The news spread.

1952
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:36,540
- Then you should come here.
- There were many cool girls here.

1953
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,790
Then you should come here.

1954
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:39,870
- So my friend brought me here.
- He did a good job.

1955
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:42,000
You went home alone anyway.
What was the point of coming here?

1956
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,680
You were invisible
to the girls anyway.

1957
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,000
Still, it must have helped
to come and study...

1958
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,910
- with a sense of excitement.
- That's right.

1959
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,310
- Isn't that right?
- It felt different.

1960
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,520
- It gave you a sense of purpose.
- It gave you strength.

1961
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,620
Of course.

1962
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,120
(They are sick and tired
of the duo.)

1963
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,140
- So I...
- This is driving me crazy.

1964
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,310
I am not used to such reactions.

1965
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,080
We are passing the City Hall.
We are nearly there.

1966
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,160
- We are nearly there.
- Yes.

1967
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,220
The City Hall building is so pretty.

1968
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,890
What's the point?
We are going to circle the place.

1969
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:04,290
- No, we are nearly there.
- We are going to circle the place.

1970
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:05,770
There are many one-way streets here.

1971
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:08,520
Just take a nap.
We will arrive in an hour.

1972
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,040
- No, we are on our way there.
- We are going.

1973
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,930
- Don't talk about the streets!
- Hey.

1974
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,500
- You jerk.
- How dare you glare at your elder?

1975
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,410
How dare you act out when you have
the class two driver's license?

1976
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,640
What? Class two driver's license?

1977
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,350
- Haha.
- That jerk.

1978
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:21,470
- That jerk?
- Hey.

1979
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:22,520
Don't you have the microphone?

1980
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,620
- He called me a jerk.
- What was that?

1981
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,790
- Haha was voicing his opinion.
- I should have gone that way.

1982
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:29,120
- Make a circle.
- Se Chan, what's wrong?

1983
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,160
He took a wrong turn again.

1984
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,680
- Did you take a wrong turn again?
- He took a wrong turn again.

1985
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,220
We will circle the rotary
about three times.

1986
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:36,390
There is nothing wrong with circling
the rotary three times.

1987
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,160
- He is so annoying.
- Jong Kook.

1988
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,200
- What's up with you?
- Seriously.

1989
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,520
Do you have a problem
with circling the rotary?

1990
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,830
Do you have a problem?
I am just asking.

1991
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:45,560
- Don't you need to exercise today?
- He took off his hat.

1992
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:48,700
- He took off his hat.
- Why did you take it off?

1993
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,810
This is driving me crazy.

1994
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,100
(They catch him in the act.)

1995
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,250
(Glancing over)

1996
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,310
Good shot.

1997
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:00,540
- Okay.
- Euljiro Two-ga.

1998
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,620
Nice.

1999
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,350
- Good.
- Let's go.

2000
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,850
- I think we should go this way.
- Yes. Let's focus.

2001
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,850
Quiet down. We need to focus.

2002
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:08,950
Why are you being so loud?

2003
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:11,600
- I didn't say a word.
- I didn't say a single word.

2004
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,270
- Turn left.
- Chungmu-ro. We are nearly there.

2005
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:16,290
- All right.
- We are nearly there.

2006
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,060
- Okay.
- This is it.

2007
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,770
If we turn left,
we will reach Chungmu-ro.

2008
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:21,310
Check the location
of our destination.

2009
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:22,930
- We will get lost.
- We need to make a U-turn.

2010
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:26,770
If we enter through here...
This is our current location.

2011
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,410
- Hold on. It's near the station.
- Yes.

2012
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:31,120
The two of you look cool.

2013
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,750
They are about to fight.

2014
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,580
- It's near here.
- Yes.

2015
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,410
This is bad.

2016
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,250
I will stay still.

2017
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:42,160
It already looks like
we are in trouble.

2018
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,020
We entered an alley. This is bad.

2019
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,720
- I think they took a wrong turn.
- We entered an alley.

2020
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,930
- The two of you were confident.
- Se Chan,

2021
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:49,160
- stay calm.
- This is good.

2022
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,430
Let's stay calm.

2023
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:52,330
Shall we make a big turn instead?

2024
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:55,200
- A big turn?
- Yes. This real estate agency...

2025
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,240
- I think it's near here.
- There is a hotel nearby.

2026
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,910
- I think it's near here.
- I see a hotel.

2027
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:01,410
There are many hotels here.

2028
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:03,620
It might not be this hotel.

2029
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,040
There are countless hotels in Seoul.

2030
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,450
- Se Chan.
- This is so hard.

2031
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:08,040
- This is so hard.
- Turn right.

2032
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,160
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

2033
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,450
No, we need to go one more block.
This isn't the place.

2034
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:13,020
This is the big road.
This restaurant is inside an alley.

2035
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,990
It's so hard to find the place
from this map.

2036
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,660
- My goodness.
- It's a one-way street,

2037
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,060
so you need to go left.

2038
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,600
This is the Printing Alley.

2039
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,830
- This is the Printing Alley.
- Really?

2040
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:23,700
- A print shop. We are nearly there.
- This is...

2041
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,430
- This is the Printing Alley.
- Shall we enter the alley?

2042
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,600
Let's enter the alley.

2043
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,100
This is the place.

2044
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,770
- This is Chungmuro Station.
- We are nearly there.

2045
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:31,270
Here is the important thing.

2046
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:32,770
- It's near here.
- Yes. It's near here.

2047
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:34,950
- Just...
- Ask a local, you punk.

2048
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,270
The right side.

2049
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,720
We need to find
this ribs in soup restaurant.

2050
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,790
- This ribs in soup restaurant...
- Sir, do you know...

2051
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:40,850
a ribs in soup restaurant
around here?

2052
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,850
- A ribs in soup restaurant.
- This place...

2053
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:44,490
- He knows it.
- The one with many customers?

2054
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:46,180
The one with many customers? Yes.

2055
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:48,950
This is a one-way street,
so go straight...

2056
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:50,790
- and turn right.
- Turn right. Okay.

2057
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:52,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2058
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,020
- We found it.
- Why didn't you ask sooner?

2059
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:56,700
- Did you see our teamwork?
- Okay. We are a fantastic duo.

2060
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,270
Had you asked sooner,

2061
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:00,910
we would have started eating by now.

2062
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:03,930
Hold on.

2063
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:05,700
Isn't that it? A print shop.

2064
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:08,040
- Here.
- Make a turn.

2065
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,770
- Here.
- Let's enter the alley.

2066
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:11,310
- A ribs in soup restaurant.
- Where is it?

2067
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:13,390
That... What's that?

2068
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:15,080
This is the place.

2069
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,520
Let's ask them. This is the place.

2070
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:20,560
This is the place.
I see the staff members.

2071
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,390
- This is the place.
- Keep going down the alley.

2072
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:24,930
- I Rye, where is the restaurant?
- The ribs in soup restaurant.

2073
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:27,120
- It's behind you.
- It's behind us. Thank you.

2074
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,200
(They get a decisive hint
from Se Chan's manager.)

2075
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,770
- We had good teamwork.
- That's right.

2076
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:32,270
You can only turn right.
There are restaurants here.

2077
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,040
- Jae Suk, there is the restaurant.
- Where?

2078
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,660
- Where?
- Keep going.

2079
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,830
- Do you see it?
- Keep going.

2080
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:38,000
- There it is.
- We are here.

2081
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,080
- See?
- It's the ribs in soup restaurant.

2082
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,080
- We found it.
- We found it.

2083
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,080
Really?

2084
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,250
This is teamwork.

2085
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,580
Seriously.

2086
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,250
I am impressed that you found it.

2087
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,120
- I am impressed that you found it.
- How did you find it?

2088
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,520
- Get out of the van.
- We arrived at the restaurant.

2089
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,750
- We almost missed it.
- We finally got here.

2090
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,250
- We almost missed it. This is it.
- Okay.

2091
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,350
- I saw it.
- This restaurant is hard to find.

2092
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:59,000
- Jae Suk.
- Se Chan.

2093
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,060
I saw it.

2094
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,830
Suk Jin, you should have seen
the sign.

2095
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,160
- Gosh.
- You found it.

2096
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:06,470
- You found it well.
- I saw the sign.

2097
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:08,160
You found it well.

2098
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:09,640
- Hey.
- What?

2099
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,080
You look like a thug.

2100
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:13,970
You did a good job
finding the place.

2101
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,910
- It looks delicious.
- Hello.

2102
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,180
I saw the sign.

2103
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,770
- We are the best. Nice teamwork.
- We had nice teamwork.

2104
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,450
On your way here,
many members reported...

2105
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:23,660
- how Suk Jin took off his hat.
- What?

2106
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,520
Five penalty balls will be added.

2107
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,060
Okay.

2108
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:28,660
- It's not like that.
- You took it off five times.

2109
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,160
- He took it off many times.
- Five times?

2110
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,250
(This is how he got
multiple penalty balls.)

2111
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:34,000
(The 1st time he took off his hat)

2112
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,770
(Citizens made reports right away.)

2113
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:41,760
(They continued to make reports.)

2114
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,210
(We will deduct one penalty ball.)

2115
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:44,710
(Thank you!
He took it off the second time.)

2116
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:45,970
(- He took it off again.
- You will receive a benefit.)

2117
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:47,300
(He did it again.
He keeps doing it.)

2118
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,770
Think about it.
You could take off your hat...

2119
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:51,770
- and put it back on like this.
- No.

2120
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,210
Sit down.

2121
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,090
You were supposed to sweat.

2122
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,880
(He is so annoying!)

2123
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,090
He is so annoying.

2124
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:02,050
You will enjoy your meal...

2125
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,550
- here.
- Let's eat.

2126
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,960
After the meal,
you will have a short mission.

2127
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,370
- Then you will hit the road.
- Okay.

2128
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,560
It's sliced garlic.

2129
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:11,040
Ribs in soup.

2130
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,130
It contains noodles.

2131
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:13,930
We can eat it when it boils, right?

2132
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:15,540
I will take some out here.

2133
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:18,380
I will eat this much.

2134
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:19,970
There are spoons.

2135
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:22,620
All right.

2136
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,340
- Thank you.
- Eat up, Jong Kook.

2137
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:25,750
- You gave me meat.
- Here, Jong Kook.

2138
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,180
- You gave me protein.
- Why did you give him meat?

2139
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,380
- What?
- There is no meat.

2140
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,590
Why are you so jealous?

2141
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,850
- For goodness' sake.
- Why are you so petty?

2142
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,220
- What's wrong with you?
- You are 44 years old.

2143
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,920
- You are 44 years old.
- I am the jealous type.

2144
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,870
- Why are you...
- They called me jealous.

2145
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:41,090
How old are you?

2146
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,930
(The jealous man gets tormented
all day long.)

2147
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,240
It's like a love triangle.

2148
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,210
It's a unique dish.

2149
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:47,670
You should eat it like this.

2150
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:48,870
- Jong Kook.
- It's a wrap.

2151
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:50,300
- My goodness.
- Try it.

2152
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:52,750
- Try it.
- Did he make Jae Suk a wrap?

2153
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,950
- My goodness.
- How is it? Isn't it good?

2154
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,880
- That was cringe-worthy.
- Listen.

2155
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:58,450
- I hate it.
- That was cringe-worthy.

2156
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:00,290
I was going to eat it myself.

2157
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,510
Then I thought,
"Why don't I give this to Jae Suk?"

2158
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:03,760
That was cringe-worthy.

2159
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,790
- Jae Suk gave me meat.
- That's right.

2160
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:09,630
So I wanted to do something for him.

2161
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,520
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

2162
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,200
You should drive next time
with So Min as the GPS.

2163
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,240
- Okay.
- Suit yourself.

2164
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,340
- GPS So.
- Yes.

2165
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,670
I will make sure...

2166
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,760
no one says a word in the back.

2167
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,040
We should all take a nap.

2168
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,880
- Why don't we take a nap?
- Yes.

2169
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,510
(They really won't say a word.)

2170
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:27,010
- We should all take a nap.
- That would be funny.

2171
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,140
That would be nice.

2172
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:29,670
We should all snore.

2173
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:30,880
A sweet nap.

2174
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,050
Is it good?

2175
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,450
(The Korean dessert,
fried rice is ready.)

2176
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:37,760
- Give me your plate.
- We will give you some rice.

2177
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,880
Okay.

2178
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:40,790
- Jae Suk, this is yours.
- Thank you.

2179
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:43,830
It would be tastier if it's crunchy.

2180
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:45,550
We should push it down.

2181
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,200
- Hey, don't say such nonsense...
- Thank you.

2182
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,200
while eating.

2183
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:49,500
Seriously.

2184
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,560
Why would you complain...

2185
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,410
- when they made it with care?
- What did he say?

2186
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:55,630
Did I do something wrong?

2187
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,100
Haha, what did you say?

2188
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,630
I said it would be tastier
if it's crunchy.

2189
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,970
Then he said,
"Don't say such nonsense."

2190
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:01,250
That's...

2191
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,010
Think about it.

2192
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,450
There are people
who always complain...

2193
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:05,880
- when they eat.
- That's right.

2194
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,550
- I hate such people.
- "It's salty. It should be bland."

2195
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:09,960
- Gosh.
- Don't be like that.

2196
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,460
- Eat without complaint.
- That's right.

2197
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,130
Gosh.

2198
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:15,760
I will tell you
how close of a relationship...

2199
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,760
Jong Kook and I have.

2200
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,960
- Do you know why?
- Listen up.

2201
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:22,130
What? I am going to eat this.

2202
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:23,260
Let us eat.

2203
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,430
- All right.
- You keep giving a speech.

2204
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:27,370
- "Listen up."
- All right.

2205
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:28,410
Everyone.

2206
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,540
Listen up. Pay attention.

2207
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:32,340
- You must be curious about...
- This is so annoying.

2208
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,050
how Jong Kook and I manage
to stay so close.

2209
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:36,140
- No.
- No.

2210
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:40,210
- I am not curious.
- We are curious.

2211
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:41,420
(We are curious.)

2212
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,790
- Everyone.
- What's this? A talk show troupe?

2213
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:47,160
- Yes. We are a talk show troupe.
- We are a troupe.

2214
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:49,330
- A talk show troupe.
- Yes. Two, three.

2215
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:50,550
Hey.

2216
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:52,350
They have nice teamwork.

2217
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,420
- I am annoyed.
- A talk show troupe.

2218
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,630
You are good.

2219
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,500
So the two of you are
a talk show troupe.

2220
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,010
- We are a talk show troupe.
- That's right.

2221
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:02,770
- We go anywhere to tell stories.
- That's right.

2222
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:05,040
- We go anywhere.
- We travel around the nation.

2223
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:07,170
Let's scrape thus rice.

2224
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,140
- "Let's scrape thus rice."
- You mean "This."

2225
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:10,770
- "Let's scrape thus rice."
- "Let's scrape thus rice."

2226
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:11,840
(He makes a mistake
whenever he opens his mouth.)

2227
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,590
- That came out wrong.
- Suk Jin is old.

2228
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:15,920
- Seriously.
- The master of talk.

2229
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,050
"Let's scrape thus rice."

2230
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,520
I had shrimp in my mouth.

2231
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,160
Suk Jin became flustered.

2232
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:22,260
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2233
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,500
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2234
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:26,700
Did you enjoy the meal?

2235
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,330
- Yes.
- It was very tasty.

2236
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:30,000
- Citizens will join you...
- It was so tasty.

2237
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,700
for this mission as well.

2238
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,370
The mission is a success...

2239
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:35,040
if a citizen says
all members' names in five seconds.

2240
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,240
- I see.
- Really?

2241
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,410
It will be hard.

2242
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:39,710
You get three tries.

2243
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:40,710
(They go in search of a citizen
who will bring back fall.)

2244
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,770
- Four, three, two,
- Song Ji Hyo, Yoo Jae Suk, Haha,

2245
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:44,450
- one. Time's up.
- Ji Suk Jin, Kim Jong Kook...

2246
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:45,580
Gosh.

2247
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:47,050
(Gosh.)

2248
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,680
- So Min.
- She was so disappointed...

2249
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,960
that she went, Gosh."

2250
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,760
Five, four,

2251
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,760
- three,
- Ji Suk Jin, Kim Jong Kook,

2252
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,760
- two,
- Yoo Jae Suk,

2253
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,920
- one. Time's up.
- Jeon So Min, Haha...

2254
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,130
(She failed because she hesitated
at first.)

2255
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:58,630
Ha Dong Hoon, Yang Se Hyeong,

2256
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:00,200
- Yang Se Hyeong?
- Kim Jong Kook.

2257
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,370
(Yang Se Hyeong?)

2258
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:06,060
- Yang Se Hyeong?
- All three attempts failed,

2259
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,410
so no one will get fall clothes.

2260
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:08,840
- I am so upset.
- Let's move to the next location.

2261
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,130
- Let's go.
- We need to keep going.

2262
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:11,380
- Let's go.
- She called me Yang Se Hyeong.

2263
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,580
GPS So.

2264
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:14,800
- Give me the map.
- GPS So.

2265
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:16,710
Let's see. Where are we going?

2266
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:18,310
- I will check the map.
- Okay.

2267
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:19,840
All right.

2268
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,310
We are starting
from Chungmuro Station.

2269
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:23,090
Our destination is L Tower.
You know how to get there.

2270
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:24,810
- Are we going to L Tower?
- Yes, take a look.

2271
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:25,990
L Tower.

2272
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:27,880
Gosh, it's easy.

2273
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,500
You can just follow what you see.

2274
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,590
It's easy.

2275
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,020
L Tower.

2276
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:35,670
- You don't even need to look.
- Everyone.

2277
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:37,260
We are going to L Tower.

2278
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,040
I will give you a comfy ride.

2279
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,100
L Tower is an easy destination.

2280
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,300
It's easy.
We won't need to complain.

2281
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,880
- I will give you a comfy ride.
- Okay.

2282
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,950
Please give me a round of applause.

2283
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:51,170
(Uninterested)

2284
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:52,250
No one is clapping.

2285
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:53,340
It's okay.

2286
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,750
- Suk Jin, let's go.
- Let's go.

2287
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:58,760
- Let's take a sweet nap.
- Suk Jin's era is here.

2288
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,290
Be careful.

2289
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:02,550
(They are off to a shaky start.)

2290
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:05,130
- It was nothing.
- You can do it.

2291
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,700
Please be gentle
with the brake pedal.

2292
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,760
- Okay.
- My goodness.

2293
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:10,060
- Suk Jin.
- For goodness' sake.

2294
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,260
I am getting motion sickness.

2295
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:16,270
- Suk Jin, we need to sleep.
- All right. What?

2296
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:18,880
Hey, you are having a shoot.
You can't sleep.

2297
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,210
We already talked in the car.
There is nothing else to talk about.

2298
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:23,310
I am going to sleep.

2299
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:25,950
- "I am going to sleep."
- If you do that...

2300
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:28,290
People are yawning already.

2301
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:30,260
- I know. I am so tired.
- Listen.

2302
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:34,290
If you don't talk,
the entire ride will get edited out.

2303
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:36,300
The distance is quite long.

2304
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,800
You should go this way.

2305
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,520
It won't take that long.

2306
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,020
- Already...
- Where are you going?

2307
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,520
- Suk Jin.
- It's this way.

2308
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,800
Suk Jin, Jae Suk is sleeping.
Please quiet down.

2309
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,170
- What?
- Sleep tight.

2310
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:47,630
- He is sleeping.
- Sleep tight, everyone.

2311
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:48,710
- Okay.
- All right.

2312
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:49,770
Is everyone falling asleep?

2313
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:51,210
Yes. Everyone is tired.

2314
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,100
- Is everyone falling asleep?
- Why are you sleeping?

2315
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,170
- Hey.
- Yes?

2316
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:56,210
GPS So, take a nap.

2317
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:58,210
- Take a nap?
- Take a nap. It's okay.

2318
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:00,420
- Really?
- Everyone is sleeping anyway.

2319
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,340
- Really?
- This will get edited out anyway.

2320
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:05,260
- It will cut to us getting out.
- Don't be sullen and talk that way.

2321
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,520
Seriously.

2322
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:08,220
Why are you so petty?

2323
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:10,700
- I am not petty.
- We were making a funny situation.

2324
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,020
- Don't say it will get edited out.
- It won't get edited out.

2325
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,520
It will be funny if we fall asleep.

2326
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,430
- Don't say it will get edited out.
- Don't be like that.

2327
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:19,200
I had to react.
Did you expect me to keep quiet?

2328
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,710
- For goodness' sake.
- I...

2329
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:25,470
Suk Jin, you need to make a U-turn
and go to Dongho Bridge.

2330
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:28,750
(Suk Jin misses the timing
and goes straight.)

2331
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,170
Dongho Bridge. That's right.

2332
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:31,170
Give me a break.

2333
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:32,550
- I will take Namsan First Tunnel.
- Dongho Bridge. That's right.

2334
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:34,450
- Where are you going?
- I will take Namsan First Tunnel.

2335
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:36,050
- Suk Jin.
- What?

2336
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:38,050
Make a U-turn
and go to Dongho Bridge.

2337
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,050
- You have a point, but...
- You will make a detour.

2338
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,630
There will be heavy traffic.

2339
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:43,050
You should make a U-turn
and go to Dongho Bridge.

2340
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,960
Suk Jin, we are supposed
to be done by 3 p.m.

2341
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,670
- What time is it now?
- It's 2:30 p.m.

2342
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:47,760
- Already?
- It's game over.

2343
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,330
You gave me the wheel too late.

2344
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:50,540
We wasted time.

2345
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,960
I should have gone.

2346
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:53,670
- We should have done that.
- Hey.

2347
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,210
I should have made up my mind.

2348
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:58,270
"I should have gone?"
You are the one who got lost.

2349
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:01,270
- Dongho Bridge has less traffic.
- No. Dongho Bridge...

2350
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:03,120
You should have taken
the Dongho Bridge.

2351
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,270
Had I had GPS,
I would have taken that route.

2352
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,620
- Suk Jin, take the right lane.
- You shouldn't say that.

2353
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,850
- What did you tell me earlier?
- What?

2354
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:11,550
His tone is sullen.

2355
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:13,380
- Suk Jin's tone is sullen.
- He is sullen, right?

2356
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,180
- Suk Jin's tone is sullen.
- I can tell from his tone.

2357
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,020
I am not... Not sullen.

2358
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,500
"I am not... Not sullen."

2359
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,630
There is a traffic jam.
What should we do?

2360
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:24,260
- It gets bad here.
- A traffic jam gets bad here.

2361
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,260
- It would be better to run.
- It will be like this...

2362
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:27,340
until the Banpo Bridge.

2363
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,840
Would Dongho Bridge be
any different?

2364
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,340
- It would be much better.
- There would be a traffic jam too.

2365
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,950
- It would be much better.
- We took a detour too.

2366
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:35,010
Dongho Bridge would be much better.

2367
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:37,580
Suk Jin, what's
the estimated time of arrival?

2368
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:38,950
Fifteen minutes later.

2369
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:41,640
- What?
- Don't lie. That's impossible.

2370
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,260
- To L Tower?
- Yes.

2371
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:44,490
It's game over.

2372
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:46,550
All of us will get the penalty
if we don't arrive by 3 p.m., right?

2373
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:47,630
I think it will take 30 minutes.

2374
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:49,550
No. It will take 20 minutes at most.

2375
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:50,960
- No way.
- It will take longer than that.

2376
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:52,660
I can't see.

2377
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,500
- He is cold.
- Suk Jin.

2378
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,370
If you were going to be like that,

2379
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:01,740
why did you make her sit
next to you?

2380
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:02,760
Why did you sit her there?

2381
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:06,270
So Min, I am sorry.
I was looking at the side mirror.

2382
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,910
- Your paper blocked my view.
- That's right.

2383
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:10,270
- That's right.
- That was why I did that.

2384
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:11,620
That was so funny.

2385
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:13,810
- What?
- My goodness.

2386
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:15,290
- Suk Jin.
- Mister.

2387
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:16,810
Wake up.

2388
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:18,590
- I am sorry.
- I was so startled.

2389
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:20,520
- Mister.
- I was so startled.

2390
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,020
Don't suddenly step on the brakes.
Ji Hyo is sick.

2391
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:25,500
I didn't step on the brakes.

2392
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,920
- You did that.
- We almost threw up.

2393
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,500
- I stepped on them gently.
- We almost threw up.

2394
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,460
- Ribs in soup almost came out.
- I heaved two times.

2395
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,800
Do you want to fill the car
with ribs in soup?

2396
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,870
(Suk Jin receives
so many complaints.)

2397
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:35,370
- Suk Jin.
- We won't get there on time.

2398
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,670
How many minutes remain?

2399
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:38,380
Ten minutes remain.

2400
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,300
- We won't get there on time.
- A traffic jam is inevitable here.

2401
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,080
- It's inevitable.
- There are so many cars.

2402
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,380
A traffic jam is inevitable here.

2403
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:45,170
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

2404
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,490
- Suk Jin.
- What's wrong with you?

2405
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:49,380
- I am scared.
- You need to keep a safe distance.

2406
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:52,710
You need to keep a safe distance
when you drive.

2407
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:53,830
- So Min.
- What are you, a magnet?

2408
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:54,920
You aren't in a parking lot.

2409
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,200
Why do you put our car's mouth
to that car's butt?

2410
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,830
Seriously.

2411
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:00,390
That's an expression
my dad always uses.

2412
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:02,060
- So Min.
- Keep a distance.

2413
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,740
- I know that, but...
- Keep a distance from the butt.

2414
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,930
So Min is a bit annoyed too.

2415
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:07,560
- We can't get there on time.
- We don't have much time.

2416
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:10,010
- What time is it now?
- Suk Jin, don't feel so pressed.

2417
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:12,080
- You need to turn right.
- I plan to do that.

2418
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,380
We are here. Lotte World.
Isn't that the L Tower?

2419
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:16,770
We need to go inside.

2420
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:17,950
Where is the destination?

2421
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:19,140
The shooting location.

2422
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:20,550
The meetup place.

2423
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,990
I see. Is there such a place?

2424
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:25,160
(There is no confidence
in his voice.)

2425
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,380
We will see it when we make a turn.

2426
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,180
Right? We will see it
when we make a turn.

2427
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,720
Why do you suddenly want
my approval?

2428
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,830
- My heart is beating fast.
- Suk Jin's heart is beating fast.

2429
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:34,500
I can hear your heartbeats
from here.

2430
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,000
Your heart is pounding.

2431
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,300
You didn't wet your pants, did you?

2432
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,300
(His heart rate escalates
as the stop sign goes on.)

2433
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,760
It's so hot.

2434
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:41,710
Your heart is pounding.

2435
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:43,040
Why is the stop sign so long?

2436
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,300
- Suk Jin, it's 3 p.m.
- We won't get there on time.

2437
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,210
- Suk Jin, you ruined it.
- What are we going to do?

2438
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:49,580
It's over.

2439
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,710
I told you it was impossible.

2440
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:56,010
- You arrived at the last place.
- Yes.

2441
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:58,710
I told you earlier
that everyone must change...

2442
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:02,180
into fall clothes
to succeed in the mission.

2443
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,800
- My goodness.
- We failed.

2444
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,700
- Only two people changed,
- Okay.

2445
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:09,260
so you must pick penalty balls.

2446
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:10,460
Okay.

2447
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,000
But we will allow
the overlapping names.

2448
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,090
Okay.

2449
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:15,240
Suk Jin has five penalty balls
in there, right?

2450
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,800
- I am bound to get picked.
- I will give you the number.

2451
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:19,010
For goodness' sake.

2452
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:21,640
- I feel bad for Suk Jin.
- Jae Suk has two penalty balls.

2453
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,380
- Suk Jin has seven penalty balls.
- What?

2454
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:25,420
- Earlier...
- Seven?

2455
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,710
- Jong Kook has two penalty balls.
- Okay.

2456
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:29,250
Haha made reports,
so he has one penalty ball.

2457
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,290
Thank you.

2458
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:32,290
- For goodness' sake.
- Ji Hyo has one penalty ball.

2459
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:34,350
- Se Chan has one penalty ball.
- Okay.

2460
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,850
So Min has two penalty balls.

2461
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,550
Why does So Min have two?

2462
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:39,500
- I made a report.
- Those with one penalty ball...

2463
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:41,670
- made reports.
- Reports.

2464
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,960
- Let's go.
- What's the penalty?

2465
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,170
- You had the fall race.
- Yes.

2466
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:49,460
The fall sky is well-known
to be high and clear.

2467
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,510
Go on.

2468
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,340
So the penalty involves...

2469
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:55,770
taking a photo at a place
that is the closest to the fall sky.

2470
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:59,120
(Taking a photo at a place
that is the closest to the fall sky)

2471
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,490
On a bridge that is 541m
above the ground,

2472
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:04,490
take a photo with a designated pose.

2473
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,210
- Where?
- Not here?

2474
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:07,420
- It's on the top.
- There is the Sky Bridge.

2475
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,020
- Not here?
- Not here?

2476
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,390
Okay.

2477
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:13,500
(We will reveal the romantic place
for the penalty.)

2478
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:18,930
(They will get a bird's-eye view
of Seoul in fall.)

2479
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:22,260
(They won't forget this fall.)

2480
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:24,380
It's a serious penalty,
but she said it as if it were nothing.

2481
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,380
- "That's the penalty."
- She said it as if it were nothing.

2482
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:27,450
Pick the balls.

2483
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:29,380
- Please.
- My one ball wouldn't get picked.

2484
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,210
I would get picked, right?

2485
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,710
- You would get picked.
- Will you pick five balls?

2486
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:33,750
You will pick five people, right?

2487
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:36,310
- Overlapping names count too.
- Let me take out one penalty ball.

2488
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:38,210
- Come on.
- I hope all five balls...

2489
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:39,290
belong to Suk Jin.

2490
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,350
Gosh, this is...

2491
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,300
- Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

2492
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,630
(Jong Kook: 2 penalty balls)

2493
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,040
- Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook.

2494
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,210
This isn't much of a penalty
for Jong Kook.

2495
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:56,880
I will make a good memory.

2496
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,130
- He would enjoy it.
- I can't help but be expectant.

2497
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:01,450
- He would enjoy it.
- Se Chan.

2498
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:03,050
(Se Chan got picked
despite the low chance.)

2499
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:04,170
- I had one ball.
- Good.

2500
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:05,310
You still got picked.

2501
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:06,470
You never know.

2502
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:07,750
- You might avoid getting picked.
- That's a possibility.

2503
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:09,380
I am surprised
that Suk Jin didn't get picked yet.

2504
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:10,680
- Suk Jin.
- He got picked.

2505
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:12,260
(Suk Jin got picked without fail.)

2506
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,050
- He didn't get lucky.
- Two more penalty balls.

2507
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:15,590
- I don't want overlapping names.
- Mix them up more.

2508
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,200
- Two more penalty balls.
- Two more penalty balls.

2509
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,850
- I had one penalty ball.
- Seriously.

2510
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:21,260
I hope I get picked again.

2511
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:23,060
- Jong Kook.
- Okay.

2512
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:24,870
(Jong Kook got picked again.)

2513
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:26,370
- It's strange.
- One more penalty ball.

2514
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:27,600
- One.
- What are the odds?

2515
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,930
Is this the last one?

2516
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:30,300
Let me avoid this one.

2517
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,630
- Let me avoid this one.
- Please.

2518
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:32,910
Please. I am so scared of heights.

2519
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:38,530
- I hope Jae Suk gets picked.
- I don't mind the penalty,

2520
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:39,770
- but I will go home late.
- Jae Suk.

2521
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:40,790
- Please.
- Jae Suk.

2522
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,990
- Did you pick it?
- It's Jae Suk.

2523
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:44,700
(Yoo Jae Suk)

2524
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,110
Did you check the name first?

2525
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:48,530
They didn't check the name.

2526
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:50,480
- I avoided that fate.
- This really is...

2527
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,680
Yoo Jae Suk's Running Man.

2528
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,150
- He never gets left out.
- I...

2529
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:54,570
- Four people.
- What should I do?

2530
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,540
I am so scared of heights.

2531
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:59,940
Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Suk Jin,
and Se Chan. Four people.

2532
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,450
I only had one penalty ball.

2533
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:02,520
(Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Suk Jin,
and Se Chan will get the penalty.)

2534
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,360
Let's hurry up.
Let's film it and go home.

2535
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,360
The other three members can go home.

2536
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,620
- Bye.
- Go home.

2537
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:09,360
- I feel so bad.
- All right.

2538
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,730
- Let's go.
- I feel so bad.

2539
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:12,860
All right. Let's go.

2540
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,290
We can't avoid this fate.

2541
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:18,810
- This is...
- We are doing it since it's safe.

2542
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:19,830
- Is it safe?
- Yes.

2543
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:20,830
It's safe.

2544
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,370
We get scared of such things.

2545
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,570
We get scared.

2546
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:24,850
Do many people get scared?

2547
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:26,040
Many people get scared.

2548
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,040
Of course. Although they get scared,
they enjoy the thrill.

2549
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,480
What's the age restriction?

2550
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,910
You need to be 12 years old
or older.

2551
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:33,020
Do children do this?

2552
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:34,910
- Do middle schoolers do this?
- Yes.

2553
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,890
So far,

2554
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,650
Who was the oldest one to try this?

2555
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:42,560
Only those under
the age of 65 can try this.

2556
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:45,730
Suk Jin, you barely made the cut.

2557
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:47,790
If he was a little late,
he wouldn't have gotten to try this.

2558
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:49,400
Only those under
the age of 65 can enjoy it.

2559
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:52,470
- Gosh.
- You narrowly made it.

2560
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:55,280
- I think the zipper is broken.
- Let me do it for you.

2561
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:57,200
- Isn't it broken?
- No.

2562
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,940
Why are we wearing this suit?

2563
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,110
- He keeps asking questions.
- Because he's scared.

2564
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,650
Too many questions.

2565
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,650
To avoid getting my clothes stuck?

2566
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:07,980
That means it's dangerous.

2567
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:10,650
- Gosh, I'm so scared.
- Oh, dear.

2568
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,080
My heart is pounding already.

2569
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,930
The highest place
in the sky of Seoul.

2570
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:16,730
Today, the wind is strong.
It's very windy.

2571
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:17,820
This is so scary.

2572
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,120
Gosh, it's too high.

2573
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:20,690
(The view makes them
give an exclamation of surprise.)

2574
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:23,440
Gosh, what is all this?
It's unbelievable.

2575
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:24,640
My gosh.

2576
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,070
(He can't help but give
a side glance at the blue sky.)

2577
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:27,110
This is terrifying.

2578
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,180
Is this it? Where is it?

2579
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,330
I think we're almost there.

2580
01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:32,280
No way. It can't be that short.

2581
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:33,940
Is this it?

2582
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:37,040
(The cool wind and magnificent view
make them feel liberated.)

2583
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,260
Jong Kook, the floor is
transparent glass in the middle.

2584
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,610
- What?
- Look over there.

2585
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,480
- I can't look down.
- I think they are acrylic plates.

2586
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,560
This is...

2587
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,100
There are gaps in the bridge.

2588
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,690
(The bridge has gaps in it.)

2589
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:53,860
There are transparent plates
in the middle.

2590
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:55,570
- What?
- The four plates are transparent.

2591
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:57,470
- No.
- Between the plates?

2592
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:58,970
You should be careful.

2593
01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:01,270
There are holes.

2594
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,110
(He can't believe his eyes.)

2595
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,330
You should be careful of the holes.

2596
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:05,480
Gosh, this is...

2597
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:07,070
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk should...

2598
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:10,180
be in the middle,
but we can switch places.

2599
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,180
(He plucks up his courage
and takes a step forward.)

2600
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:12,890
- My gosh.
- He must be scared.

2601
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:13,890
(He plucks up his courage
and takes a step forward.)

2602
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:16,150
My gosh.

2603
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,890
My goodness. I'll go...

2604
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:21,990
Darn it. My goodness. I'll go...

2605
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:24,770
(He shivers with fear
and turns around.)

2606
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:26,470
This is so scary.

2607
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,160
- Jae Suk, come here.
- Do you want to switch places?

2608
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,900
- I'll go first.
- You go first, Jong Kook.

2609
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:33,660
- I can't do this.
- Let us switch places.

2610
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,330
How many safety devices are there?

2611
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:37,110
Stop asking questions.

2612
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:38,110
I'm so sorry.

2613
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:41,150
He's been asking questions
about the safety devices all day.

2614
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,020
- Shall we go? Let's do this.
- I'll go first.

2615
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,650
- Wish me good luck.
- This is crazy.

2616
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:46,320
Hey, don't look down.

2617
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,080
You should be careful.

2618
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,110
Okay. All right.

2619
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:53,360
This is no joke.

2620
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,930
Jae Suk, watch out for the holes.

2621
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,430
Be careful of the holes.

2622
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:59,270
(He takes a step toward the fall
one by one.)

2623
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:05,200
(This is the only place
where you can feel the fall sky.)

2624
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,330
(There's no way he can feel it.)

2625
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:07,360
I just looked down.

2626
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,030
I'm so terrified.
Hurry and come here.

2627
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,780
Hurry, Suk Jin. I'm so scared.
It's very windy here.

2628
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,350
Hurry, Suk Jin.

2629
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:16,440
- You have to hurry.
- Darn it.

2630
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,040
(They have to get together
to take a commemorative picture.)

2631
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:21,760
Why are we doing this?

2632
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:23,360
Hurry, Suk Jin. I'm so scared.

2633
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,780
(The ones at the head are
struggling because he's late.)

2634
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:26,260
- Sorry.
- Hurry, Suk Jin.

2635
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,320
There are holes.

2636
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:28,860
It's so windy here.

2637
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:29,930
Please stop it.

2638
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:32,270
(Shaking)

2639
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:34,100
It's so windy here.

2640
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,830
Please stop it. I'm so scared.

2641
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,790
(He's begging sincerely.)

2642
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:40,070
The wind... Don't move.

2643
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:42,510
Gosh, it's a hole.

2644
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,680
- Hurry.
- My gosh.

2645
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,780
- Hurry and come here.
- Okay.

2646
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,180
My goodness. Don't come close.

2647
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:50,070
- Please.
- Hurry.

2648
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:52,040
Hurry. Come here.

2649
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,080
All right.

2650
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:54,950
- Make it quick.
- Look at the camera.

2651
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,690
Hurry and take it.

2652
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:59,360
Make it quick. Hurry.

2653
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,560
- One, two, three.
- Hurry.

2654
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,430
(They completed the penalty.)

2655
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:06,070
- All right.
- Let's go back.

2656
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:07,070
(The season of the high sky)

2657
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:08,730
- Why did you take this off?
- Go?

2658
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:09,990
Gosh, the wind is so strong.

2659
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:10,990
Darn it.

2660
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:12,360
This is driving me crazy.

2661
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,570
Hurry. I have to pee.

2662
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:16,640
- It was so scary.
- I wouldn't have done it alone.

2663
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,810
I would be too afraid to do this
if I were alone.

2664
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:20,870
(We'd like to thank the citizens
for helping us find the fall.)

2665
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:24,150
(Running Man Original Film)

2666
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,650
(What does the bomb look like?)

2667
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,040
(The bomb seemed big.)

2668
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:30,780
(It's here.)

2669
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,690
(Ten bombs...)

2670
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:34,190
(with six cords each)

2671
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,230
Please.

2672
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:39,820
(There's a designer who planned
the whole thing in this building.)

2673
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:40,990
(Kim Rae Won)

2674
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:42,440
(Two spies among the ten members?)

2675
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,640
Who did this?

2676
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:45,940
(There's no progress
in the investigation,)

2677
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:47,530
(but the timer keeps ticking.)

2678
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:50,730
(- I have 5 minutes left.
- I have 9 minutes left.)

2679
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:52,810
(If you want to stop it,)

2680
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:54,910
(you must catch the designer.)

2681
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:57,070
No!

2682
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:58,940
(Operation: Pass the Bomb)

2683
01:26:58,940 --> 01:26:59,940
