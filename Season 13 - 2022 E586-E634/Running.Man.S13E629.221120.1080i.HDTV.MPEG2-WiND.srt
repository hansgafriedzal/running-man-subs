1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,260
- Hello.
- Come here, Ji Hyo.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,970
Look at Ji Hyo's fashion today.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,540
What's with Ji Hyo?
It looks like an awards ceremony.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,680
Oh, right. Haha...

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,810
Ji Hyo looks chic today, right?

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,440
You look pretty. It's so cool.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,320
When something like this happens,

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,480
it means she got...

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,140
- a new stylist or something.
- She looks amazing.

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,620
- She did.
- I knew it.

12
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,940
Right. She got a new stylist.

13
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,050
- Really?
- She did.

14
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,850
- She wants to show something.
- Right.

15
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,010
- Why did you get a new stylist?
- He's so sharp.

16
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,320
Her stylist would want
to make her presence felt.

17
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,960
- Exactly. It's a performance.
- "This is what I can do."

18
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,620
So Min is all dressed up today.

19
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,620
- NewJeans.
- Right.

20
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,690
- Is someone coming today?
- We need to point that out.

21
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,860
You look pretty.

22
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,460
It's strange. She's too dressed up.

23
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,460
Right. What's with her?
Why is she dressed up?

24
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,530
- She must have a reason.
- No.

25
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,330
We have to point this out.
This is connected to the previous story.

26
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,180
- Let me tell you what it is.
- What is it?

27
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,400
What's going on?

28
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,780
- This is about So Min's spy.
- So Min's spy?

29
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,420
(So Min's spy?)

30
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,640
- Is she...
- Is it caught?

31
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,490
- Did you catch the spy?
- That's right.

32
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,780
- Not yet.
- It's not caught yet.

33
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,490
She also knew about
Seok Jin Versus Seok Jin.

34
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,780
She did.

35
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,780
(A question about So Min's spy
has been continuously raised.)

36
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,960
(It was first suggested 6 months ago
at the Credit Card Payment Race.)

37
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,360
- Who is it?
- "We'll dress as slaves tomorrow."

38
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,440
(All the information about venues,
concepts, and PPL has been leaked.)

39
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,270
(She even knew about Jin of BTS,
which was top secret.)

40
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,550
(Who's So Min's spy
who leaked all the information?)

41
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,240
She didn't seem surprised
when the door was open.

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,440
This is what's important.

43
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,940
Since So Min knows a lot
about the shoot,

44
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,520
she can prepare an outfit
that's perfect...

45
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,460
for the concept of the day.

46
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,830
- She even knows about the penalty.
- That's right.

47
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,430
This is getting too big.

48
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,430
- We must cut this vicious link.
- We have to.

49
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,860
(It's time to catch the spy.)

50
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,860
Everyone. That's why...

51
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,500
I've been trying
to detect the spy...

52
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,610
who's been helping So Min.

53
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,910
It's not one of our producers.

54
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,180
- Because...
- Really?

55
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,300
We've been talking about it
for quite a long time.

56
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,110
So they wouldn't have been able
to keep giving her the information.

57
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,580
Then is it one of our writers?

58
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,520
- I don't think it is...
- No.

59
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,360
- one of our writers.
- It can't be one of our cameramen.

60
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,610
Now...

61
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,320
- That's Chan Hee!
- Is it Chan Hee?

62
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,660
- It might be Chan Hee.
- Kang Chan Hee.

63
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,460
- It's not Kang Chan Hee.
- Gang Gam Chan Hee.

64
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,990
- The spy is you, Gang Gam Chan Hee.
- Gang Gam Chan Hee?

65
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,430
Let me tell you
why it's not Chan Hee.

66
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,140
Chan Hee got surgery
for his cervical disk,

67
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,800
so he couldn't come to work
for three months.

68
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,510
- But she still knew stuff.
- So Min kept getting information.

69
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,540
So Chan Hee is excluded
from the list of suspects.

70
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,840
Congratulations.

71
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,340
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

72
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,140
- Then who is it?
- Who would it be?

73
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,840
- Soon, So Min's spy...
- Spy.

74
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,390
- will be caught.
- Good.

75
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,760
We will start the project soon.

76
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,890
(The spy-catching
project is coming soon.)

77
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,460
- That sounds so thrilling.
- Good.

78
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,760
- We will catch the spy.
- That's right.

79
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,050
This is so funny.

80
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,260
- Catch the spy.
- And the one who's...

81
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,170
most indifferent to this
looks like the spy now.

82
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,240
- The spy is Song Ji Hyo.
- It's you!

83
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,270
- It's not Ji Hyo.
- Bang!

84
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,510
- It can't be Ji Hyo.
- She has nothing to do with this.

85
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,040
So is So Min dressed up like this
because she knows about today?

86
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,080
- That's right.
- I guess someone's coming.

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,180
But today...

88
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,180
- We are having guests today.
- I see.

89
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,420
- What's with her?
- Gosh, Jeon So Min.

90
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,950
What's going on?

91
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,140
All right.
We will bring in the guests...

92
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,610
- who will join today's race.
- My goodness.

93
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,760
(So Min already knows
about today's guests.)

94
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,050
- I got goose bumps.
- She knew it.

95
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,650
I just know
that we have guests today.

96
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,800
What kind of guests are they,
So Min?

97
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,560
They're coming from there.

98
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,060
- This way.
- Hey, Sang Hun.

99
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,170
- Hello.
- Hey.

100
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,240
(Actor Jeong Sang Hun)

101
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,980
(And more guests show up after him.)

102
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,300
- That's Oh Tae Sik.
- This is amazing.

103
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,480
Tae Sik.

104
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,510
(Actor Kim Rae Won,
Actor Park Byung Eun)

105
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,950
(An actor with charismatic looks
and a charming voice)

106
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,740
(Park Byung Eun, the icon
of a fatal villain)

107
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,050
(Jeong Sang Hun shows his top-tier
performance in a comic role.)

108
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,830
(Kim Rae Won, the actor
who lives up to his name)

109
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,800
(And he's the protagonist
of the legendary film, "Sunflower.")

110
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,460
(Oh Tae Sik is back.)

111
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

112
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,830
- I'm a big fan.
- Hello.

113
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,610
- Oh Tae Sik is back.
- Did you really have to take...

114
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,370
- everything from me like that?
- Oh Tae Sik is back!

115
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,840
I love him.

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,390
- My gosh.
- Actually,

117
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,580
- Se Chan loves the movie.
- I do.

118
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,960
I'm a big fan of Oh Tae Sik.

119
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,090
- Oh Tae Sik.
- That's true.

120
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,750
Oh Tae Sik is back!

121
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,990
- I'm so excited.
- He's still...

122
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,430
- He's still Oh Tae Sik.
- To me, he's Oh Tae Sik.

123
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,860
Se Chan uses the name
when he books a restaurant.

124
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,900
- I always use the name.
- Right.

125
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,360
- That's true.
- I'm serious.

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,190
- You live as Oh Tae Sik.
- I do.

127
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,470
- You should show him, Se Chan.
- Oh Tae Sik.

128
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,410
"Who did that?"

129
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,870
"Byung Jin, you wait outside."

130
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,070
You just sound like a fool.

131
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,350
Isn't he just a fool?

132
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,720
No, this is what he did.

133
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
- Hey.
- "Byung Jin, you wait outside."

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,990
"I can't believe this."

135
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,240
"Byung Jin, you wait outside."

136
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,450
"Did you really have to..."

137
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,920
All right.
We have three guests today.

138
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,050
- Let's meet them one by one.
- This is so nice.

139
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,050
All right. Byung Eun, please say hi
to our viewers.

140
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,120
Hello. I'm Actor Park Byung Eun.
Nice to meet you.

141
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,970
"The Fishermen and the City."

142
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,930
He's from
"The Fishermen and the City."

143
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,190
Is he on
"The Fishermen and the City?"

144
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,840
That's his latest work.

145
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,340
- He's a close friend of Tae Hyun.
- Right.

146
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,480
And In Sung.

147
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,740
- He's also close to Sang Yeob.
- Right.

148
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,500
And we have Kang Rae Won here.

149
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,810
It's Kim Rae Won.

150
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,480
And we have Kang Rae Won here.

151
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,810
It's Kim Rae Won.

152
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,110
- My goodness.
- Jae Seok!

153
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,180
- I'm so sorry.
- What did you just do?

154
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,990
- Who is Kang Rae Won?
- There's a man named Kang Rae Won.

155
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,430
I guess he was thinking
about Kang Won Rae.

156
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,550
- I'm so sorry.
- I know...

157
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,050
- it's been a long time, but...
- Hey.

158
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,360
How could you call him Kang Rae Won?

159
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,360
- Rae Won, it's been a long time.
- Kang Rae Won?

160
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,000
- Hello, I'm Jegal Byung Eun.
- He was confused.

161
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,700
- Just stay quiet.
- I can't believe this.

162
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,480
Why would you say Jegal Byung Eun?

163
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,180
- Don't make things worse.
- Okay.

164
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,110
- All right. We have Kim Rae Won.
- Namkoong Rae Won.

165
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,050
- I apologize again.
- It's all right.

166
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,150
Hello, I'm Kim Rae Won.
Nice to meet you.

167
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,920
(Tae Sik has
an attractive low voice.)

168
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,090
It sounds like he's in a cave.

169
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,420
He's got an amazing voice.

170
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,660
- Well...
- He was on other variety shows.

171
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,050
I had the movie press conference
a few days ago.

172
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,450
- But I see more cameras here.
- Of course, you do.

173
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,170
We have many cameras
to intimidate our guests.

174
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,400
- Some of them are fake.
- We have fake cameras.

175
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
- There are fifty cameras.
- Some of the cameras are fake.

176
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,130
They are fake cameras.

177
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,410
Some of them are fake.

178
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,040
We don't want people
to look down on us.

179
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,540
- I'm very shy with strangers.
- That's understandable.

180
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,300
So I don't know what to do now.

181
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,410
- There's a drone flying around.
- Right.

182
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,980
- That's fake.
- It's a fake drone.

183
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,220
And half of the production crew
is fake.

184
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,420
It's their hobby.

185
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,610
- Okay.
- To intimidate you.

186
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,680
And we have Sang Hun here.

187
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,110
- Hello.
- Sang Hun!

188
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,860
(The next guest is Jeong Sang Hun,
lamb skewers and beer.)

189
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,900
- How are you?
- Shut it.

190
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,030
(Shut it.)

191
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,490
- Stop talking.
- "Stop talking."

192
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,670
"Stop talking."

193
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,630
- Otherwise, you'll lose your teeth.
- My teeth.

194
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,860
You'll lose all your teeth.

195
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,260
I'm back with
a new movie, "Decibel."

196
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,410
I'm Jeong Sang Hun.

197
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,610
Sang Hun.

198
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,280
The three of them
recently did a movie together.

199
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,870
- It's called "Decibel."
- "Decibel."

200
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,110
Our movie is about a bomb
that has been set in the city.

201
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,550
The bomb goes off if it reaches...

202
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,720
- a certain decibel.
- It goes off.

203
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,110
- It's about sound.
- That sounds interesting.

204
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,550
- It sounds fun.
- Right.

205
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,660
Rae Won, tell us more
about your new movie.

206
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,050
Byung Eun pretty much said
everything that needs to be said.

207
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,990
You can talk about something else.

208
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,970
- Hey, what's wrong with you?
- Don't cut in.

209
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,170
- Leave him alone.
- What's with you?

210
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,040
Why would you treat
a top star like that?

211
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,110
Rae Won.

212
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm not the one who brought it up.

213
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,540
Byung Eun, what's wrong?

214
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,440
- What were you looking at?
- The color of his pants...

215
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,500
What about them?

216
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,810
They look good with his shoes.

217
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,680
Do you like them or what?

218
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,240
(Do you like them or what?)

219
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,360
- Why are you being like this?
- Why are you trying to fight?

220
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,090
- Move over.
- Why are you doing this?

221
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,660
- Am I not supposed to like them?
- What was that?

222
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,360
- Calm down.
- Why is he being like this?

223
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,450
- Byung Eun, calm down.
- He's older than you think.

224
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,820
- They are kind of similar.
- My gosh.

225
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,820
He looks so weak.

226
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,690
- He's a fighter today.
- I'm just feeling good.

227
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,970
Why? What makes you happy?

228
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,670
- That's because of this guy.
- Who?

229
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
- "This guy?"
- Is he your friend?

230
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,870
- Is he your friend?
- Do you not know his name?

231
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,350
- Don't you know my name?
- Are you two friends?

232
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,980
- Of course, I do.
- What's his name?

233
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,610
He asked me
about his name in a whisper.

234
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,610
That's not true.

235
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,940
She's joking.
You know she likes to play jokes.

236
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,010
- So what's my name?
- What's his name?

237
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,290
Can I call you Sung Ho?

238
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,550
- Sung Ho?
- Sung Ho.

239
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,360
- Sung Ho?
- What's his last name?

240
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,120
"Can I call you Sung Ho?"

241
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,320
- I'm sorry.
- My gosh.

242
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,300
- What's Sung Ho's last name?
- I'm sorry.

243
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,530
I'm sorry about this.

244
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,970
- What's his last name?
- His last name.

245
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,170
- Kim.
- That's enough.

246
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,800
It's not easy
to pretend not to know.

247
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,740
I'm just trying to be funny.
This is hard.

248
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,000
- So what's my last name?
- What is it?

249
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,740
What is my last name?

250
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,840
My last name!

251
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,100
- Kim...
- Kim?

252
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,940
- Kim?
- Kim.

253
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,250
Darn it!

254
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,420
(He finishes the SNL-style skit.)

255
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,790
The skit was funny. That was fun.

256
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,710
- I like the skit.
- "Kim?"

257
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,210
- "Kim?"
- He's Kim Sung Ho.

258
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,480
- Kim Sung Ho.
- I'm Kim Sung Ho.

259
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,260
I'm Kim Sung Ho starting today.

260
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,300
- I'm Lee Sung Ho.
- No, you're not Lee Sung Ho.

261
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,000
- What is it then?
- What is it then?

262
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,590
Just let it slide.

263
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,560
- Let's move on.
- "Let's move on."

264
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,040
"Let's move on."

265
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
- All right.
- You know he's old.

266
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,730
- Let's move on.
- Just say you don't know it.

267
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,470
- All three of them are hurt.
- Right.

268
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,700
What are we doing today?

269
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,650
Before we start today's race,
you should choose your teams first.

270
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,750
- Really?
- Really?

271
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,210
- There will be three teams.
- Okay.

272
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,350
The captains are Jae Seok, Seok Jin,
and So Min.

273
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,450
What? Jeon So Min?

274
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,080
(Yu Jae Seok, Jee Seok Jin,
and Jeon So Min are captains.)

275
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,580
- Me? Am I a captain? Why?
- Why?

276
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,850
Is So Min a captain?

277
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,260
Are we starting
the spy project today?

278
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,000
- Why is that?
- You were on "The Age of Shadows."

279
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,690
(Is the spy project
beginning today?)

280
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,270
- Why is that?
- You were on "The Age of Shadows."

281
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,330
- No, it was "Assassination."
- It was "Assassination."

282
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,010
Come on, Seok Jin. What's with you?

283
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,510
Will you stop that?

284
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,800
Seok Jin, please.

285
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
- It's "Assassination."
- It can be confusing.

286
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,600
Just because
it's a two-syllable word?

287
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,180
- It can be confusing.
- Like "Ditto?"

288
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,180
The secrets behind the captains
will be revealed later.

289
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,710
The three captains will stand here.

290
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,790
And the rest of the members...

291
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,760
- will choose a captain they want.
- Okay. Come here.

292
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,130
If you join my team,
you can be the captain.

293
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,800
- Really?
- I'll do the same thing.

294
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,130
- You can be the captain.
- What about you, Jae Seok?

295
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,560
I'll be the captain.

296
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,930
Is that what you're doing?

297
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,770
- Okay.
- Rae Won.

298
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,640
- It's done.
- Is it done?

299
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,370
- So we have three teams now.
- Yes.

300
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,830
Today's race is...

301
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,970
Pass the Bomb: You're the Bomb.

302
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,340
Currently, there are
two secret bomb designers.

303
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,920
(Two of the members are
the secret bomb designers.)

304
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,680
- Two of us?
- There are two.

305
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,210
The captains are
not the bomb designers.

306
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,520
- Captains are not the designers.
- That's right.

307
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,850
Not the captains?

308
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,890
- No. Not the captains.
- We're not the designers.

309
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,850
The captains who are out
of the list of suspects...

310
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,530
- were chosen by the bomb designers.
- What?

311
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,500
The bomb designers chose
these three captains.

312
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,060
- Really?
- I see.

313
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,730
- They were chosen?
- Why?

314
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,460
So there are two designers.

315
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,330
The two designers are supposed
to be on different teams.

316
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,780
If they succeed, all their
team members except for them will...

317
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,070
- get the water bomb penalty.
- All of them?

318
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,440
And the designers and the team
without a designer...

319
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,940
will win the prize.

320
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,660
If the race ends with
the designers on the same team,

321
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,930
the designers and their captain
will get the penalty together.

322
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,720
So the designers
should be separated.

323
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,870
Right. They have to be
on different teams to win.

324
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,900
So are we going
to change our team members?

325
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,400
- You can change your team members.
- Okay.

326
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,170
But only the winning team gets...

327
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,700
a chance to change team members
and hints after each mission.

328
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,550
Are we playing this game
because of our movie, "Decibel?"

329
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,010
- Yes. It's about bombs.
- My gosh.

330
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,050
I like the decibel of his voice.

331
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,340
- It sounds so nice.
- It sounds perfect.

332
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,290
- The bomb will never go off.
- Right.

333
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,450
- The bomb will never go off.
- It sounds like a cave.

334
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,890
All right. We will start the race
after you get changed.

335
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,930
- Okay.
- I like the sunshine.

336
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,160
It's so warm.

337
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,660
You're good at golf.

338
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,770
- Not really.
- Right.

339
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,820
- He's really good.
- In the waiting room...

340
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,770
- I heard Rae Won was good at golf.
- He's amazing.

341
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,270
- That's true.
- He's brilliant.

342
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,600
I heard Rae Won was very athletic.

343
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
And I heard Byung Eun was funny.

344
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,280
(The first mission for athletic
Rae Won and funny Byung Eun)

345
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,510
Let's go.

346
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,300
Here's the first mission.

347
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,880
It's called
Dating Expert or Dating Bomb.

348
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,810
There will be
questionnaires about dating,

349
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,620
and you should guess the answers
ranked 1st, 3rd, and 5th.

350
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,080
The 1st, 3rd, and 5th.

351
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,620
This is what I'm good at.

352
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,020
This is my thing.

353
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,220
(Laughing)

354
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,260
I'm...

355
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,720
- Why are you laughing at me?
- No, it's not like that.

356
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
The team who gives
the most correct answers...

357
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,670
will get hints and a chance
to change the team members.

358
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,400
- Okay.
- We need to figure out...

359
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,510
whether our team has
a bomb designer or not.

360
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,330
- So we have to win.
- We have to win no matter what.

361
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,470
Some of us will give wrong answers
on purpose.

362
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,880
Those who talk nonsense
are likely to be the designers.

363
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,940
So Min is good
when it comes to dating.

364
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,780
- That's her thing.
- Right.

365
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,290
Do you have many dating experiences?

366
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,620
I do.

367
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,660
He just likes fishing.

368
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,350
- Fishing?
- Fishing?

369
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,720
He dated fish.

370
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,050
What about you, Rae Won?

371
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,190
I like fishing too.

372
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,190
- You just like fishing.
- Rock sea bream.

373
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,820
What about you, Sang Hun?

374
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,030
- He's a master.
- I'm married.

375
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,170
As far as I know, you didn't date
many women before you got married.

376
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,830
You didn't date many women.

377
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,960
- Me?
- Yes.

378
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,430
- That's not true.
- No?

379
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,140
I bet he was popular.

380
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,180
Sang Hun is...

381
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,600
- My gosh.
- That's not true?

382
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,250
- Sang Hun was very popular.
- I bet he was.

383
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,470
- He must've been popular.
- I know that.

384
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,420
Sang Hun, were you popular?

385
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,440
- Jae Seok.
- Do I have to say it?

386
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,450
I was really popular.

387
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,790
He dated a girl I knew.

388
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,950
Really?

389
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,000
Are you crazy?
Why would you say that here?

390
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,350
I'm serious.

391
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,500
Why did you bring that up?

392
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,900
- Do you want me to talk about you?
- I'm just...

393
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,870
- I can talk about you.
- Go ahead and say it.

394
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,040
- Do you want me to talk about you?
- I'm just...

395
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,560
- I can talk about you.
- Go ahead and say it.

396
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
- Just say it.
- I can do that.

397
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,070
Here's the first question.

398
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,470
Please bring in the board.

399
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,600
"The man you'd never
introduce to your sister."

400
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,920
- Isn't this obvious?
- It's obvious.

401
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,680
- A man who's busy and flirty.
- A womanizer.

402
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,310
A guy who rarely answers his phone.

403
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,790
- Someone who's hard to reach.
- Exactly.

404
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,180
A guy with many female friends.

405
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,310
Let's talk about it one by one.

406
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,530
Byung Eun, who wouldn't you
introduce to your sister?

407
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,900
A man
who overcommits to his hobbies...

408
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,130
- That's you.
- Yes.

409
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,430
- Fishing?
- I was talking about myself.

410
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,870
- He was talking about himself.
- Fishing and golf.

411
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,670
- But he's right about that.
- Yes.

412
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,730
- It's important.
- A man who's too into his hobby.

413
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,200
- If you're obsessed with it...
- But there's a good thing about it.

414
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,730
Although he's into his hobby,
he'd be interested in nothing else.

415
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,010
- Since it's been brought up...
- I agree with him.

416
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,680
- I agree with Byung Eun.
- Yes.

417
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,180
I mean, you're too passionate
about working out.

418
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,680
- True. But that's my only hobby.
- But it's healthy, and he's frugal.

419
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,080
- I don't drink or spend much money.
- Wherever you go,

420
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,350
you need time to work out
even when you're with others.

421
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,310
- He only needs 2 or 3 hours.
- You can give him only 2 hours.

422
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,220
- Exactly.
- He needs five hours...

423
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,290
including his commute.

424
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:31,800
- No, three hours is enough.
- Don't deny it!

425
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,870
Three hours is enough.

426
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,100
Oh, great. This is it.

427
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,730
- They're finally going to break up.
- That's good.

428
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,960
They're breaking up.

429
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,700
Three hours is enough.

430
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,300
(Will the friends of the century
break up just like this?)

431
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,200
- Jae Seok, you have a point.
- Right. I see now.

432
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,340
- Yes, you're right.
- No.

433
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,440
- Jong Kook, you're right.
- You have a point too.

434
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,890
I see that you have a point as well.

435
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,080
- Sometimes I play soccer too.
- That's annoying.

436
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,680
- Right.
- Then I spend 5 or 6 hours.

437
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,790
- We need to break them up.
- He can go with his girlfriend.

438
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,850
Let's break them up.

439
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,030
What about you, Rae Won?

440
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,660
(What is Rae Won's opinion?)

441
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,170
- A man who lies often.
- Right.

442
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,370
- I agree.
- Small lies.

443
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,000
- Small lies are bad.
- I agree.

444
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,590
Rae Won,
do you often tell small lies?

445
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,670
- I don't think...
- That was unexpected.

446
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,570
- I tell lies.
- You think you don't, but you do.

447
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,380
- He got caught.
- Everyone lies once in a while.

448
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,510
Get the bottom of it.

449
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,470
I think I never tell lies, but...

450
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,340
What was the last lie you told?

451
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,180
- I never lie.
- At the opening earlier...

452
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,480
"I never lie."

453
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,310
- Earlier...
- You can pull this off, Jae Seok.

454
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,350
He's trying to squeeze it out.

455
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,260
- Jae Seok, you've got this!
- Go, Jae Seok!

456
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,680
- Jae Seok, you've got this!
- Since Rae Won is here,

457
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,760
- I'll be hard on him.
- Yes, be hard on him.

458
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,260
I'll be hard on him.

459
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,670
- I don't get to see him often.
- True.

460
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,270
- We shouldn't go easy on him.
- That's right.

461
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,590
- Squeeze it all out.
- You're right.

462
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,100
- We should be hard on him.
- Absolutely.

463
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,560
- It's our job.
- That's right.

464
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,600
He's squeezing it out.

465
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,830
Did you lie or not
at the opening earlier?

466
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,650
- I might have.
- See?

467
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,680
He's honest.

468
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,020
He's honest.

469
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,750
- He's honest.
- Could he be the designer?

470
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,420
A lot of children are watching this.

471
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,760
Is Santa Claus real or not?

472
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,030
(What will Rae Won,
who can't lie, say?)

473
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,230
He's real.

474
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,460
He's real.

475
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,550
(Santa Claus is real.)

476
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,790
- You're lying.
- Rae Won.

477
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,970
You're a liar.

478
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,470
- But he's real.
- I can't believe him.

479
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,700
- He tells so many small lies.
- He's real.

480
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,430
- I see that he tells small lies.
- He just wants to receive a gift.

481
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,480
He does tell small lies.

482
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,530
I would never
set my little sister up with him.

483
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,670
This is hilarious.

484
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,770
What about you, Sang Hun?

485
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,450
Among us?

486
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,750
The bad guy type.

487
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,270
- Oh, I see.
- But they're attractive.

488
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,950
- Women are attracted to bad guys.
- I think...

489
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,780
But you wouldn't want to set him up
with your younger sister.

490
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,090
- I hate it when a man...
- A bad guy.

491
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,780
calls himself a bad guy...

492
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,460
- to justify his unkindness.
- Exactly.

493
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,100
A bad guy comes across as blunt...

494
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,650
because he's not good at
expressing things.

495
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,600
- Aren't you that kind of person?
- What do you mean?

496
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,870
- You feel too shy to show emotions.
- Yes, I do.

497
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,430
I feel too shy
to express my affection.

498
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,000
- You're quite blunt.
- Yes, I am.

499
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,970
- You want to be a bad guy, right?
- Exactly.

500
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,880
But someone like Jae Seok
can't be a bad guy.

501
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,170
- That's right.
- Right.

502
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,350
- They have to be kind to date.
- A bad guy...

503
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:10,120
- A bad guy should be handsome.
- Or else, no one would date them.

504
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,490
- That's right.
- Hey, Sang Hun.

505
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,180
- "A bad guy should be handsome?"
- That's true.

506
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,320
- Why are you getting worked up?
- Right.

507
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,990
- I mean, you crossed the line.
- You can never be a bad guy.

508
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,650
- You're good-looking.
- No one here except for Rae Won...

509
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,950
- can be a bad guy.
- To be honest,

510
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,770
- I'm the bad guy type.
- Rae Won can.

511
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,220
- Don't be ridiculous.
- You're simply a bad person.

512
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,390
- A bad person.
- I'm quite blunt.

513
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,310
- Byung Eun?
- How is your dating style?

514
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,730
- I'm the type that calls her often.
- He must be nice to his girlfriend.

515
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,280
- Oh, he's a sweet guy.
- He'd be a good boyfriend.

516
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,210
- Byung Eun?
- I'd give her the fish I caught.

517
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,850
The fish he caught?

518
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,020
I'm not lying.

519
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,650
- That's nice.
- He gives away the fish he caught.

520
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,290
- That's great.
- He's so pure-hearted.

521
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,030
It's because those who like fishing
feel happy when they give...

522
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,390
- others the fish they've caught...
- They like giving away fish.

523
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,990
- and seeing them enjoy the fish.
- Right.

524
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,660
- Oh, that makes you happy.
- Yes, I really feel happy.

525
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,800
Byung Eun made it sound
like a heartwarming story.

526
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,490
- Why?
- Was that a lie?

527
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,200
Going fishing so often itself
makes him a bad guy.

528
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,010
- I know this because I fish too.
- I see.

529
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,670
Women don't like it, right?

530
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,110
My ex-girlfriend said this
a long time ago.

531
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,510
"Must I be jealous of a fish?"

532
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,620
Oh, right.

533
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,670
- I heard something like that too.
- That's how they feel.

534
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,140
- "Must I be jealous of a dumbbell?"
- That's exactly my point.

535
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,790
"Must I be jealous of a dumbbell?"

536
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,320
- "Must I be jealous of an octopus?"
- Because they like it too much?

537
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,260
- Yes, that's what happens.
- I understand.

538
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,760
Then what about you, Ji Hyo?

539
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,630
- I hate the opposite.
- Okay.

540
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,860
A man
who's obsessed with being kind.

541
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,030
- A man who's kind to everyone.
- Excessive kindness?

542
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,270
- A man who's kind to everyone?
- A man who's... Yes.

543
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,190
A man who's so kind to everyone
that people get the wrong idea.

544
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,810
- He'd give others the wrong idea.
- I see.

545
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,630
Personally, I would never
set my sister up with...

546
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,970
- What type of man?
- a handsome man.

547
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,010
- Why?
- Why?

548
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,110
- They are more likely to cheat.
- Jong Kook.

549
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,580
- Come on. That's not true.
- It's true.

550
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,850
Jong Kook, ugly guys cheat
despite their ugly faces.

551
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,290
Hey, that's mean.

552
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,590
- They're the worst.
- That's out of line.

553
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,260
You've crossed the line.

554
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,980
- Why are you getting upset?
- Why would you say such a thing?

555
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,630
That's why I want to set Se Chan up
with my nieces.

556
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,890
His face is just good enough.

557
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,330
(He has a just good enough face
according to Jong Kook.)

558
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,370
- It's perfect.
- So it's because he's ugly.

559
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,460
- Check the 2nd and 4th places now.
- The 2nd and 4th places?

560
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,130
What... I'm sure what we've said
is on the list.

561
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,430
- Of course.
- I'm sure of it.

562
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,170
Then let's check the second place.
Here we go.

563
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,230
(A man who makes
physical contact naturally)

564
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,470
"A man
who makes physical contact..."

565
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,170
- Right. That wasn't brought up.
- I agree.

566
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,940
- Next up is the fourth place.
- I agree.

567
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,820
- Let's find out.
- The fourth place.

568
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,480
- Oh, we got that one right.
- It's on the list.

569
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
- It's on the list.
- Aren't you surprised?

570
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,420
- But working out is not a problem.
- Right.

571
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Then we have to guess
the 1st, 3rd, and 5th places.

572
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,890
I wouldn't like a man
who likes luxury goods.

573
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,220
- A man who likes fashion.
- Right.

574
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,960
A man who likes to dress up.

575
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,660
- Right. It must be on the list.
- I think it's on the list.

576
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,870
A man who loves himself too much.

577
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,630
- Say, "Let me answer."
- Let me answer!

578
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,630
- And you'll get to answer.
- Oh, gosh.

579
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,700
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer.

580
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,970
- A man who loves himself too much.
- Isn't that our team's answer?

581
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,280
- That's our answer.
- That's our answer.

582
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,640
- No, it's not. I said it first.
- That's our team's answer.

583
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,550
- So Min came up with that answer.
- He got the chance to answer first.

584
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,880
- How could you?
- Exactly.

585
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,980
- She talked about luxury goods.
- My answer is a man with self-love.

586
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,520
- It's different. Tell them.
- It's not the same.

587
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,790
It's different. Rae Won, tell them.

588
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,760
You can say your answer
after he says his. All right?

589
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,990
You can say your answer
after he says his. All right?

590
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,460
(He settled the situation
with his low-pitched voice.)

591
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,990
- He turns out to be a good liar.
- Good job.

592
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,190
- He speaks so calmly.
- Also...

593
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,310
- He's calm and has a good voice.
- He's scary as he speaks so calmly.

594
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,900
- He has such a great voice.
- Okay.

595
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,630
- All right.
- A man with self-love, right?

596
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,670
Yes, a man with self-love.

597
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,350
A man with too much self-love.

598
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,170
- It's not on the list.
- Let me answer.

599
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,780
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

600
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,520
A man who's too interested in
improving his appearance.

601
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,320
- Isn't that the same as self-love?
- That's good.

602
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,880
A man who likes to dress up
is ranked third.

603
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,410
- I told you so.
- I knew it.

604
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,380
Rae Won, we can guess
the one ranked first.

605
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,100
- Rae Won, try to guess the answer.
- I see the words "luxury goods."

606
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,760
- I got it right.
- It should be you.

607
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,770
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

608
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,370
- A man who likes to drink.
- A man who drinks often.

609
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,600
A man who drinks often?

610
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,270
- No, a man who likes to drink.
- Let me answer!

611
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,010
- A man who likes to drink.
- Let me drink!

612
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,660
He drinks often
because he likes to drink.

613
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,310
A man who likes to drink...

614
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,230
- Let me answer.
- Give me a chance for a change.

615
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,350
- Let me answer.
- Right.

616
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,280
- A violent jerk.
- What?

617
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,710
- A violent jerk.
- That's not even worth mentioning.

618
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,620
- That's too obvious.
- A man who gets aggressive...

619
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,650
- when drunk.
- A jerk with nasty drinking habits.

620
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,320
- Let me answer!
- I bet it's on the list.

621
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,530
- You can't say several answers.
- A man with nasty drinking habits.

622
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,490
- A man with bad drinking habits.
- It must be on the list.

623
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,760
It's ranked first.

624
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,990
- That was amazing.
- It's the same as our answer.

625
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,990
- Really?
- No way.

626
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,270
- But...
- It's the same as our answer.

627
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,960
- He said several answers.
- That's what we meant.

628
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,370
- They said several answers.
- He said more than one answer.

629
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,160
- How many answers did he say?
- I did a good job, right?

630
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,470
- He said more than 1 answer.
- He said 5 answers.

631
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,040
A man who gets aggressive
when drunk.

632
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,700
Can we guess
the one ranked fifth now?

633
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,970
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

634
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,320
- A man who never answers his phone.
- Oh, right.

635
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,350
- It must be on the list.
- A man who's hard to get a hold of.

636
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,740
- Maybe it didn't make the list.
- It's one of the other answers.

637
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,560
- Let me answer.
- A man who's close to his mother?

638
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,590
A mama's boy.

639
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,220
- Yes. I bet it's the one.
- Right.

640
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,030
- It didn't make the list.
- Let me answer.

641
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,890
- Let me answer.
- I'll give you a hint.

642
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,070
- It was mentioned earlier.
- I see.

643
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,390
- Let me answer.
- When? Did we mention it?

644
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,370
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

645
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,540
- Sang Hun, go ahead.
- Something like physical contact.

646
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,660
- A friend of mine.
- Maybe.

647
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,770
- What?
- It didn't make the list.

648
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,660
- Oh. That's a shame.
- That's funny. "A friend of mine."

649
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,670
Let me answer!

650
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
- Let me answer.
- She said we had mentioned it.

651
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,940
A jerk who stays in touch
with his ex-girlfriend.

652
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,550
- My gosh.
- Hey.

653
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,350
Stop it.

654
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,520
- Jong Kook mentioned it.
- Jong Kook did?

655
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,020
- What did I say?
- Jong Kook, it was your idea.

656
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,480
- What did I say?
- Try to remember.

657
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,210
- What did I say?
- Try to remember what you said.

658
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,260
- What did I say?
- Is it regarding working out?

659
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,760
- But it's already on the list.
- What did I say?

660
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,920
Try to remember what you said.

661
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
(Thinking hard)

662
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,360
- Let me answer.
- What is it?

663
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,130
- You talked about a handsome man.
- Oh, right.

664
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,390
- A handsome man.
- A handsome man.

665
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,400
Really?

666
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,660
- I remembered what he said.
- Hey.

667
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,810
- A handsome man.
- Is it really on the list?

668
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,670
I would never set my sister up
with a handsome man.

669
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,670
- A handsome man was the answer?
- Right. You shouldn't.

670
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,550
- Such men are more likely to cheat.
- They're more likely to cheat.

671
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,910
- I agree because none of the men...
- A perfect man. Right.

672
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,120
they wanted to set me up with...

673
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,240
- was handsome.
- Right.

674
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,910
- One of the other answers is...
- Yes.

675
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,720
a man who doesn't get nervous
even when he sees a pretty woman.

676
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,480
- Why?
- I don't understand.

677
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,530
It means that he pretends
he's not interested in her.

678
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,630
- Because he's sly?
- Maybe he's not interested in her.

679
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,330
Women hate it
when a man shows his interest too.

680
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,540
- But...
- They hate it if we're interested.

681
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,840
- We shouldn't hide our feelings.
- Then what should we do?

682
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,610
- Is there a halfway point?
- What should we do?

683
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,200
You shouldn't compliment
the beautiful woman...

684
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,700
- to the point...
- Yes.

685
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,240
that it offends your girlfriend.

686
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,440
- Right.
- Of course.

687
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,280
- But you can share your opinion.
- You must be tactful.

688
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,520
- Should we?
- It'd be weird if you hide it.

689
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,090
Oh, my. Can you be that confident?

690
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,520
- That's bold.
- What I'm saying is...

691
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,410
that you shouldn't react
whenever you see a pretty girl.

692
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,790
"My gosh. How gorgeous."

693
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,450
- "Beautiful."
- "Honey."

694
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,530
- "Look at her. She's gorgeous."
- See?

695
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,450
- "She's incredibly beautiful."
- You shouldn't react like that.

696
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,160
- That's not good.
- You shouldn't react like that.

697
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,990
But when your girlfriend asks you
for your opinion...

698
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,300
- What would you say?
- "Well, I think..."

699
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,400
"that she's stylish.
She has a great fashion sense."

700
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,930
- "How about I dress like that?"
- I don't think that's a good idea.

701
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,540
- What?
- "How about I dress like that?"

702
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,230
- "I don't think it suits you."
- That's not a good idea.

703
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,400
"Why? You said she looked pretty."

704
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,850
"Yes, but it suits her, not you."

705
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,020
"Are you saying I'm ugly?"

706
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,240
- "No. You have your own style."
- "Are you saying I'm ugly?"

707
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,140
- He's in trouble.
- "You said that it was pretty."

708
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,410
- He messed up.
- Exactly.

709
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,710
- He fell into a hole.
- I shouldn't react that way.

710
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,360
"Since you like her style,
I want to try it."

711
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
- "I love you just as you are."
- Just tell her that she's prettier.

712
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,560
"Why would you copy her style?"

713
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,360
- "You never said I was pretty."
- Tell her that she's pretty.

714
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,030
- Say, "You're prettier than her."
- But...

715
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,890
- She's upset.
- Just tell her...

716
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,870
- "I can't..."
- He can't get it sorted out.

717
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,660
- "I can't say you're prettier..."
- He can't deal with the situation.

718
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,040
"I can't say
you're prettier than her."

719
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,170
Jae Seok isn't good at improvising
in a situation like that.

720
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I believe that you should be honest.
But don't go overboard.

721
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,380
- Let's move on to the next survey.
- Okay.

722
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,910
What's this?
"When you want some alone time..."

723
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,710
- What to say to go home on a date?
- I see.

724
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,120
- Can we start right away?
- Let me answer.

725
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,520
- Let's begin right away.
- We're ready.

726
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,590
- If we talk about this topic...
- We'll begin right away.

727
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,290
- I'd say that I'm not feeling well.
- Faking it?

728
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,980
- "I'm not feeling well."
- Pretending to be sick.

729
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,720
- Pretending to be sick.
- Pretending to be sick.

730
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,650
- Lying that you're feeling unwell.
- "I'm not feeling well."

731
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,030
- In a worse case,
- "I'm sick."

732
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,040
- you can say it two days before.
- To make it sound convincing.

733
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,570
- Two days before the date, say,
- To make her believe you.

734
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,160
- "I think I'm having a cold."
- Right.

735
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,280
- What's funny is...
- "I'm sick."

736
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,540
- that you start feeling unwell.
- "I'm not feeling well."

737
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,550
- "I'm not feeling well."
- You actually start feeling unwell.

738
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,550
- "I'm not feeling well. I'm sick."
- "I'm sick?"

739
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,640
- It's ranked second.
- Oh, good.

740
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,180
(I'm not feeling well.
I think I need to rest.)

741
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,520
- Oh, the 2nd place?
- The 2nd place? What a shame.

742
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
(They get a point when they guess
the 1st, 3rd, or 5th place.)

743
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,180
- Let him answer.
- Let me answer.

744
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,290
"Something came up at home.
My parents need me home."

745
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,450
A memorial service.

746
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,130
- "My parents need me home?"
- I agree with Jae Seok.

747
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,650
"Something came up at home."

748
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,130
- It's ranked second.
- But... Okay.

749
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,920
- It's ranked third.
- My gosh.

750
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,630
- Which one?
- A memorial service?

751
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,930
- Is it on the list?
- A memorial service.

752
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,930
"Something came up at home."

753
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,130
"Something came up at home?"

754
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,400
I think he has said that
as an excuse before.

755
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,930
- Have you ever told that lie?
- He can't tell a lie.

756
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,470
- I have never done that before.
- I see.

757
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,850
I... No.

758
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,710
- You can even put on an act.
- We didn't get a point.

759
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,980
Your mother asks you to pick up
something on your way home.

760
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,290
You say, "Right now?"

761
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,790
- He's acting.
- You start putting on an act.

762
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,150
- "Yes. I see."
- "What did you say?"

763
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,260
"What?"

764
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,720
- I can tell he's acting.
- "What's wrong?

765
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,220
- You're suspicious.
- You got caught.

766
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,330
Your acting went on for too long.

767
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,530
- "Right now?"
- She suddenly says, "Hello?"

768
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,630
"Yes. Got it. Okay."

769
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,840
(The phone call ended.)

770
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,610
- "What's the matter?"
- "What is it?"

771
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,340
He can't make eye contact
with her...

772
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,040
- because he's not a good liar.
- "I should go now."

773
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,810
- "Why? Is something going on?"
- "Where are you going?"

774
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,550
- He's chuckling.
- Why are you chuckling?

775
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,880
- He can't tell a lie.
- He failed.

776
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,410
He got caught.

777
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,640
- By the way,
- "Where should you go?"

778
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,140
- "Where are you going?"
- why is it always So Min...

779
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,820
who plays my girlfriend?

780
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,410
- She was so natural and serious.
- Prosecutor Jeon.

781
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,030
- You can't get out of it.
- Prosecutor Jeon.

782
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,360
- You got flustered, right?
- I mean...

783
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,720
- As if you were trapped in a maze.
- No.

784
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,030
I'd be worried first.
"Is everything okay?"

785
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,830
- I know, but...
- "Is everything okay?"

786
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,030
- She says she'd be worried first.
- Her eyes...

787
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,990
She doesn't look like she's worried.

788
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,890
It's as if she were saying,
"Look at you trying to fool me."

789
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,900
She's like an investigator.

790
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,400
She looks like an investigator.
Prosecutor Jeon.

791
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,540
Let me answer.
I've said this before.

792
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,610
"You don't look well.
Why don't you go home?"

793
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,700
(Suggesting she should go home)

794
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,280
Oh, right. Yes.

795
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,580
"You don't look well."

796
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,710
Is it on the list?
"You should go home now."

797
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,980
- It's ranked fourth.
- Oh, really?

798
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,920
- It really is on the list.
- How come we got...

799
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,360
- the 2nd and 4th right?
- I'm surprised.

800
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
It's on the list.

801
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,420
- But we didn't get a point.
- "You look tired. Why don't you..."

802
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,300
- "go home now?"
- What a way to fool your lover.

803
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,660
- That's unbelievable.
- "You look tired."

804
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,230
- "You don't look well."
- My goodness.

805
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,160
"You have dark circles
under your eyes."

806
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,460
When she's feeling so energetic.

807
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,630
She couldn't feel better.

808
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,510
She even got a massage
before meeting him.

809
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,510
- Let me answer. "Let's go..."
- Seok Jin...

810
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,550
- Why?
- He got it right.

811
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,910
- He's very active right now.
- I don't even remember...

812
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,550
- the previous topic.
- He's very active.

813
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,710
It's so funny...

814
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,260
I can't even remember
the previous topic.

815
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,910
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

816
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,360
Say you'll take her for a drive
and go to her house naturally.

817
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,100
Driving her home?

818
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,720
While driving...

819
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,370
- Drop her off at her house.
- "We're in front of your house."

820
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,130
- "Go on in."
- He's so good at acting.

821
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,660
"How about we have canned coffee?"

822
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,730
- Just like salmons.
- Yes.

823
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,230
Just like salmons.

824
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,660
- Naturally... Yes.
- Opening the car door for her.

825
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,630
If I were his girlfriend,
I would be so disappointed.

826
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,970
He said he'd take me for a drive
and drove me home.

827
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,820
- But...
- "Why are we heading to my house?"

828
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,210
(Correct)

829
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,120
- Is it on the list?
- Really?

830
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,150
- Really?
- It's ranked fifth.

831
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,380
For real?

832
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,020
- It's on the list.
- Really?

833
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,330
Is it really on the list?

834
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,090
- Do some people really do that?
- For real?

835
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,830
I didn't expect that.

836
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,650
"I didn't realize we were walking
to your house. Go home safely."

837
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,030
Seok Jin is amazing.

838
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,530
- That was unexpected.
- Great job.

839
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,730
- Seok Jin...
- That's unbelievable.

840
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,870
Seok Jin is like an expert
when it comes to this topic.

841
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,930
- He got three answers right.
- Seok Sam is a pro.

842
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,630
- Exactly.
- I have experience.

843
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,670
He's on a roll.

844
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,040
- I saw the one where Seok Jin...
- I'm surprised.

845
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,200
- Which episode?
- The one where he was...

846
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,080
excited because his family members
were on an overseas trip.

847
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,380
(In Episode 621)

848
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,880
(When the news about
his wife's trip was shared,)

849
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,360
(the devoted husband's true face
was revealed.)

850
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,360
- Oh, you saw it?
- Yes.

851
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,800
(Rae Won saw the legendary scene.)

852
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,160
- I was reminded of that scene.
- Because of that...

853
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,990
His wife saw that
and decided not to go on a trip.

854
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,800
- She canceled the trip.
- Because she was so upset.

855
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,340
- Because she was upset.
- And Seok Jin was disappointed.

856
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,900
He was disappointed.

857
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,280
I wonder what's ranked first?

858
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,430
We only have the first place left.

859
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,510
Could it be something like this?
"Something urgent came up."

860
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,510
Right.

861
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,820
Let me answer.
"Something urgent came up."

862
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,820
- "My supervisor called me over."
- That's the one.

863
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,790
- "Something came up."
- Right. I knew it.

864
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,820
(The answer is
"Something urgent came up.")

865
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,380
"Something urgent came up."

866
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,090
- "Something came up at home?"
- It's different.

867
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,330
It was "My parents are coming
to my house."

868
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,390
- We got that one right.
- Exactly.

869
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,300
- You did a good job.
- Indeed.

870
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,030
- It's simple.
- Yes.

871
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,370
Something just came up.

872
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,840
I'll read another example for you.

873
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,540
"I need to go and meet someone
to sell something."

874
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,040
- Really?
- That must be disappointing.

875
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,280
- Times have changed.
- Indeed.

876
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,550
- It's a good idea.
- I think it's a great idea.

877
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,440
I tagged along with my ex-boyfriend
when he went to meet a buyer.

878
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,910
(I tagged along
with my ex-boyfriend.)

879
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,980
- He must've felt smothered.
- Hey.

880
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,710
- He must've felt smothered.
- It's like being locked up.

881
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,520
Couldn't you just let him breathe?

882
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,180
You should've let him go alone.

883
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,630
So Min is so hilarious.

884
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,830
- "When do you hate your friend..."
- "Who's in a relationship?"

885
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,030
- It makes you upset.
- When they kiss in front of me.

886
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,840
Who would do that?

887
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,370
- In a barbecue restaurant.
- Hey!

888
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,840
- Hey.
- No one would do that.

889
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,780
- I have...
- After eating a vegetable wrap.

890
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
And Cheongyang chili.

891
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,050
A friend who puts one leg
over her boyfriend's lap.

892
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,780
- That'd be really annoying.
- It's annoying.

893
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,520
And she touches his ear like this.

894
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,620
"My boyfriend...
I'll tell you something about him."

895
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,760
- Who is she dating?
- Rae Won.

896
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,710
As a result, Team So Min won.

897
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,090
- Yes!
- All right.

898
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,150
(Team So Min won.)

899
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,330
Gosh, So Min.

900
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,100
The captain of the winning team...

901
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,220
will be informed
if there's a designer on her team...

902
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,390
- and get to change a team member.
- Okay.

903
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,270
- If not, change a member.
- You can decide...

904
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,840
- whether to change a member.
- No, I shouldn't.

905
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,780
If So Min changes a member,
it's likely that he's a designer.

906
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,170
- No. Whatever they tell her,
- No. You don't know that.

907
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,740
- Exactly. Right.
- it'll affect her decision.

908
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,620
They'll tell her
if our team has a designer.

909
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,350
(She's telling So Min
if there's a designer on her team.)

910
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,620
Why are there two designers?

911
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,860
So Min, tell us later.

912
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,650
Having four members isn't
an advantage, right?

913
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,880
- We'll all survive if we stay.
- The probability will rise.

914
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,180
Won't you change a member?

915
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,190
(What could be
Captain Jeon's decision?)

916
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,560
Regardless of the hint,
I want to change the atmosphere.

917
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,300
- The whole team.
- Really?

918
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,890
Her team must have a designer.
That's why she made that decision.

919
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,190
I'm not a designer. Trust me.

920
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,310
Win another round to see if there's
still a designer on the team.

921
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,840
Send Byung Eun to another team
no matter what. I'm not a designer.

922
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,630
- Why should she send me away?
- It might be true. Haha...

923
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,110
- He's suspicious.
- Haha might be telling the truth.

924
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,550
He must be one of the designers.

925
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,710
(What could So Min's decision be?)

926
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,280
- Trust me. It's not me.
- I'll replace Haha.

927
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,090
- Hey, you fool.
- Oh, it's Haha.

928
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,240
- Goodness, you fool.
- I will...

929
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,320
- replace Haha.
- With whom?

930
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,830
- Well...
- He must be one of the designers.

931
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,830
(Whom will she recruit?)

932
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,450
- You're making a mistake.
- I hope she won't send Haha here.

933
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,260
- So Min is so foolish. So Min.
- That's right.

934
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,100
You're sending me away
because you heard we had a designer.

935
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,830
- Oh, her team has a designer.
- That's not the case.

936
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,460
- There's a designer on that team.
- If you think about it,

937
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,040
even if there are no designers
on your team,

938
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,630
you can choose to change a member
just to cause confusion.

939
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,630
- Is it up to the team captain?
- That's right.

940
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,470
But So Min wouldn't pull a trick
like that.

941
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,880
- What kind of game will we play?
- Okay.

942
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,010
- That's an important tip.
- It's not a difficult game.

943
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,320
You don't have to be smart
to win this game.

944
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,820
- Then I won't be a bad choice.
- Then...

945
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,050
What makes you think
So Min is not smart?

946
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,380
- Exactly. That's offensive.
- Why...

947
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,450
- I mean, So Min...
- It makes me upset too.

948
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,980
- Why do you think that So Min...
- You guys,

949
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,130
- I'm not offended at all.
- But...

950
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,530
- I'm not offended.
- I mean...

951
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,830
- We feel offended.
- Are you biased against us?

952
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,300
- I want Sang Hun on my team.
- That's so funny.

953
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,930
- I'll replace Haha with Sang Hun.
- You want me to go?

954
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,930
- Okay.
- Okay. Then the team members...

955
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,540
will be changed as she said.
Let's move to the next place.

956
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,610
- Let's go.
- Yes, that's right.

957
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,640
Keep a close eye on him.

958
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,020
- Whom? Okay.
- Haha. Keep a close eye on him.

959
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,820
He's suspicious.
He must be one of the designers.

960
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,820
(They'll move to another place
for the next mission.)

961
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,460
You'll play the drawing game you like.
It's Air Picasso.

962
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,530
- Air Picasso?
- We're good at drawing.

963
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,040
Each team will play the game
at a time.

964
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,570
The first player has to draw
a given keyword in the air.

965
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,230
Another player watches
the first player's drawing,

966
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:37,850
draws it on a sketchbook,
and guess the keyword.

967
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,640
- It's so difficult.
- The remaining player...

968
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,020
has to guess the keyword...

969
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,210
based on the drawings in the air
and on the sketchbook.

970
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,550
The other teams...

971
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,710
can also guess the keyword
based on the drawing in the air.

972
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,620
You get two points if you guessed
what your team members draw.

973
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,860
You get one point if it's a question
for another team.

974
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,300
- Got it.
- What a fun new game.

975
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Each team will get three minutes...

976
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,360
to draw in the air
and guess the answer.

977
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,890
The two teams that finish
first and second...

978
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,130
- will receive the benefits.
- Got it.

979
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,770
Can other teams
also guess the answer?

980
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,460
Yes, but only from the drawing
that is drawn in the air.

981
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,200
- Okay.
- Of course.

982
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,970
- Jeonsobari's team will go first.
- Team So Min is up first.

983
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,140
Ready...

984
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,410
(Byung Eun will be drawing
in the air.)

985
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,940
- And go.
- Let's observe.

986
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,850
(The first word)

987
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,140
Byung Eun is hilarious.

988
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,880
It's three-dimensional.

989
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,790
I doubt they drew it correctly.

990
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,260
- He just drew a star.
- What is that?

991
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,830
A circle. A black hole!

992
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,530
Byung Eun is hilarious.

993
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,100
It's three-dimensional.

994
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,030
(Copying Byung Eun's movement)

995
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,370
- He just drew a star.
- What is that?

996
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,960
A circle. A black hole!

997
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,840
Why are you drawing
a three-dimensional object?

998
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
It's three-dimensional.

999
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,310
I doubt they drew it correctly.

1000
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,730
- He just drew a star.
- What is that?

1001
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,200
(Yang Ssaebssaeb
tries to intercept.)

1002
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,080
Why are you drawing
a three-dimensional object?

1003
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,350
A black hole!

1004
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,580
- Let me answer.
- I don't get it.

1005
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,290
A helicopter.

1006
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,590
- I think that's right.
- That's the one.

1007
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,940
(Helicopter is the right answer.)

1008
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,480
- How?
- How did you know that?

1009
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
You scored one point.

1010
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,060
- Nice!
- How did you know that?

1011
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,190
I lost track of my own drawing.

1012
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,370
Byung Eun, you should be
looking over here.

1013
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,130
I'm the one
you should be drawing for.

1014
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,160
- You?
- Yes.

1015
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,770
- Our team.
- You're part of their team.

1016
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,160
Byung Eun complimented me
on a job well done.

1017
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,540
- Byung Eun.
- But he did do a good job.

1018
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,610
- He's not on your team.
- You shouldn't be helping him.

1019
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,700
- We're on a different team?
- We need to win this.

1020
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,070
He asked if they were on
different teams.

1021
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,180
Check the color of your jacket.

1022
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,970
- Let's switch.
- Let's trade places.

1023
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,450
- Swap places.
- Let's change it up.

1024
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,990
Sang Hun, draw well.

1025
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,660
- Sang Hun, draw well.
- Draw well.

1026
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,890
Hold on a second.

1027
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,280
I'll keep it simple.

1028
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,720
- How can we guess this?
- He'll keep it simple.

1029
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,720
(Bidet)

1030
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,260
- All right.
- He's quite good at drawing.

1031
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,930
Here we go. Watch closely.

1032
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,930
I'll draw it as is,
starting up here.

1033
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,070
Sure. Go ahead.

1034
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,110
Okay.

1035
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,300
- And inside...
- Okay.

1036
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,380
A flower pot!

1037
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,510
- I see.
- And then...

1038
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,950
Watch this.

1039
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,490
This one is three-dimensional.

1040
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,180
What's that?

1041
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,430
- A fountain.
- A fountain.

1042
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,390
I'll do it once again.

1043
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,760
I'll do it once again.

1044
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,970
Let me answer.

1045
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,260
Let me answer. It's a bidet.

1046
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,840
A bidet?

1047
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,360
(Hesitant)

1048
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,610
- A bidet?
- I think that's right.

1049
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,700
- A bidet.
- I think that's the one.

1050
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,880
(Bidet is correct.)

1051
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,450
- He drew the toilet.
- Yes, the toilet.

1052
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,640
(That was close.)

1053
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,820
- Why weren't you participating?
- I didn't know the answer.

1054
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,050
It was a bidet.

1055
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,090
(A swing)

1056
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,360
This is a simple one.

1057
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,680
- We're at zero points.
- It's a simple one.

1058
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,430
- It's really simple.
- We'll guess correctly for you.

1059
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,950
- Just follow the lines.
- We're at an advantage.

1060
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,800
- Sang Hun, show us instead.
- Right.

1061
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,390
- Let us see it.
- Show us instead.

1062
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,930
It goes down.

1063
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,430
Down and across.

1064
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,860
It came back.

1065
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,740
- What is this?
- It goes down.

1066
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,880
(A swing)

1067
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,300
Down and across.

1068
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,680
It came back.

1069
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,740
(She has the outline of a swing.)

1070
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,180
- What is that?
- I don't get it at all.

1071
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,320
It came back?

1072
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,450
It came back.

1073
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,890
- What is that?
- I don't get it at all.

1074
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,950
It came back?

1075
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,680
- Let me answer!
- What is that?

1076
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
(Swinging)

1077
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,530
(The 3D swing moves back and forth.)

1078
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,700
Let me answer. A seesaw!

1079
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,820
- I meant a swing.
- A swing.

1080
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,320
Let me answer. A seesaw!

1081
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,470
(He was late.)

1082
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,090
- Okay!
- Good job.

1083
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,800
- I said "swing."
- Our team said it.

1084
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,610
- She didn't say, "Let me answer."
- She did.

1085
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,430
- I said that.
- She said it.

1086
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,930
- "Let me answer. A swing."
- That's right.

1087
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,180
I said all of it.

1088
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,910
Look at him talk.

1089
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,050
You said "seesaw" first.

1090
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,180
- I know, but...
- Ji Hyo was faster.

1091
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,910
- She said the right answer.
- We agree that you won.

1092
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,780
- "Got it."
- She said it first.

1093
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,780
Our team wasn't able
to score any points.

1094
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,610
- What do we do?
- Team So Min, your time is up.

1095
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,360
- And you scored zero points.
- Okay!

1096
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,490
We can guess the answers later on.

1097
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,930
- Are we up next?
- Yes.

1098
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,660
- We'll guess theirs instead.
- Rae Won, you should draw.

1099
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,760
(Team Jae Seok is up next.)

1100
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,820
- That left me suspicious.
- It doesn't give you an advantage.

1101
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,320
I now have my doubts.

1102
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,570
Byung Eun, why weren't
you saying anything?

1103
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,490
I said "zebra" earlier,
but someone beat me to it.

1104
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,700
Jeonsobari, move.

1105
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,680
- What were you even drawing?
- Byung Eun's gaze...

1106
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,910
- You weren't enthusiastic.
- That's not true.

1107
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,910
You didn't say anything
after claiming to know the answer.

1108
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,180
That's not true.

1109
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,510
- We'll guess theirs correctly.
- But...

1110
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,090
- I don't think the drawing helps.
- We'll guess theirs instead.

1111
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,910
- I'll give it a shot.
- Go ahead.

1112
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,550
Are you ready?

1113
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,820
(The first word)

1114
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,930
Look into his eyes.

1115
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,160
- His eyes?
- Hold on.

1116
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,470
He's taking a while.

1117
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,930
- It must be tricky.
- Yes, tricky to draw.

1118
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,300
No, that's not the case.

1119
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,860
I'll just draw the outline
since it's an easy one.

1120
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,010
(He begins to draw in the air.)

1121
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,160
- Waves?
- Let me answer.

1122
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,430
(He begins to draw in the air.)

1123
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,950
Let me answer. Diving.

1124
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,680
(Incorrect)

1125
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,050
Now, watch this.

1126
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,410
Here's the outline of the object.

1127
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,140
Is it up top?

1128
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,130
- Two dots.
- What's that?

1129
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,280
(He's drawing a power strip!)

1130
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,090
Two dots. An excavator?

1131
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,450
(He's drawing a power strip!)

1132
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,450
(A mess)

1133
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,860
- Two dots.
- What's that?

1134
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,930
That...

1135
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,390
- An excavator?
- Let me answer.

1136
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,590
A truck.

1137
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,260
- Let me answer. An excavator.
- A tank.

1138
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,070
(Incorrect)

1139
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,530
- What is this?
- Let me answer. An excavator.

1140
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,380
- This is a hard one.
- I'll draw it again.

1141
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,570
- From here...
- Is it a tough one?

1142
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,680
Is it hard to guess?

1143
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,470
Watch closely from here.

1144
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,050
Here's the outline.

1145
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,110
(Calmly)

1146
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,490
- You sound like a top tutor.
- You're very kind.

1147
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,280
Here we go.
There are different kinds of these.

1148
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,590
I'll draw it once more.

1149
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,010
(Chapter 1: The Fundamentals
of a Power Strip)

1150
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,220
Doesn't he seem
like a science teacher?

1151
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,760
- You get the shape, right?
- Yes.

1152
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,530
It's like this.

1153
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,160
There's a circle...
Another circle...

1154
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,570
Let me change the order of things.

1155
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,930
From this to...

1156
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,160
Is he allowed to talk like this?

1157
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,840
- Can't I?
- Hold on.

1158
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,110
- You shouldn't talk.
- Seriously.

1159
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,180
- He has a nice voice though.
- I was enjoying his voice.

1160
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,910
- Let me answer. A button.
- Doesn't he have a nice voice?

1161
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,140
(Incorrect)

1162
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,340
A line and then another line.

1163
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,140
I'll make this bigger.

1164
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,720
- Right.
- What is that?

1165
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,220
Two dots.

1166
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,550
Let me answer!

1167
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,660
Electrical outlet!

1168
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,760
- I think that's it.
- What?

1169
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,320
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer. A power strip.

1170
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,530
- Let me answer.
- Nice!

1171
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,660
Okay, good.

1172
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,300
Electrical outlet, no.
A power strip.

1173
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,860
- How was that a power strip?
- That was it.

1174
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,930
Hold on a second.

1175
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,140
How can one guess that?

1176
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,140
- Show us your drawing.
- Here's your power strip.

1177
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,860
- It's true.
- You draw it.

1178
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,510
- It's similar.
- Why couldn't you tell?

1179
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,740
You did quite well.

1180
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,300
It wasn't an easy one.

1181
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,880
A power strip
isn't that distinguishable.

1182
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,180
- It doesn't pop into your head.
- Okay.

1183
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,640
Here we go.

1184
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,780
- What's that?
- Okay.

1185
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,760
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer. A snowman.

1186
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,890
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer. A bottle gourd.

1187
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,490
(Incorrect)

1188
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,320
It's similar.

1189
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,700
It's similar?

1190
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,890
Are you kidding me?

1191
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,360
- He can't say that.
- So what?

1192
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,800
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1193
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,930
Olaf.

1194
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,700
Let me answer. Hoppangman.

1195
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,280
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

1196
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,300
- Let me give you a hint.
- A hint?

1197
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,970
You're supposed to be
giving us hints anyway.

1198
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,910
From my perspective...

1199
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,140
- I know what it is.
- Right here.

1200
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,180
That's Korea.

1201
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,550
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1202
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,780
(It's on Jeju Island.)

1203
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,220
That's Korea. Jeju Island.

1204
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,450
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1205
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,550
- I know.
- Jeju Island.

1206
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,130
- No.
- Let me answer.

1207
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,160
Let me answer. I know what it is.

1208
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,760
- A hareubang.
- A hareubang.

1209
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,470
- Okay.
- A hareubang.

1210
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,360
- A dol hareubang.
- A dol hareubang.

1211
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,260
(The witty Team Seok Jin
guessed correctly again.)

1212
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,430
Something native to Jeju Island.
So that's what it was.

1213
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,660
- I see.
- We should switch places.

1214
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,140
- Take my seat instead.
- What?

1215
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,140
- But he was the best.
- Keep Rae Won up there.

1216
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,680
- It wasn't an easy one.
- It wasn't.

1217
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,840
A power strip and a hareubang.

1218
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,910
- That was a tough one.
- I didn't get it at all.

1219
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,340
I have to ask this.

1220
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,240
Are you both designers?

1221
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,590
No, I'm not it.

1222
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,390
I'm not a designer.
I'm just bad at this game.

1223
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,590
Aren't they both designers?

1224
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,860
Good job, guys.

1225
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,090
- A hareubang was tough to draw.
- We scored a lot of points.

1226
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,160
We did score a lot of points.

1227
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,180
Okay, watch closely.

1228
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,220
(Millstone)

1229
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,130
It has to be flat.

1230
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,300
- That's three-dimensional.
- Keep it flat, will you?

1231
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,800
- It's three-dimensional.
- It's supposed to be a drawing.

1232
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,070
- Draw it in front of you.
- Got it.

1233
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,380
Then...

1234
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,550
(Millstone)

1235
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,240
Why did it have to be him
of all people?

1236
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,180
- Poke.
- He makes it hard for us to focus.

1237
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,720
- What?
- I can't concentrate.

1238
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,450
(Will this be enough
to know that it's a millstone?)

1239
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,180
- He's terrible at drawing.
- I can't concentrate.

1240
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,720
- Can you take it from the top?
- Here we go.

1241
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,160
It's a flat drawing.

1242
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,260
- A flat drawing?
- Yes.

1243
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,470
(A flat drawing of a millstone)

1244
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,030
Let me answer.

1245
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,360
- Let me answer.
- I bet he knows what it is.

1246
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,530
Is it a millstone?

1247
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,610
- Let me answer.
- It's our turn.

1248
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,740
Okay, nice.
Nicely done with the millstone.

1249
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,450
- Good.
- I see.

1250
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,050
Why on earth would you
draw it that way?

1251
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,380
(Thanks to Rae Won,
Team Jae Seok scores 2 points.)

1252
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,550
Are you a genius?

1253
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,490
- It was a millstone.
- I can't believe it.

1254
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,840
There wasn't a handle.

1255
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,360
There wasn't a handle.

1256
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,780
That was him sticking the handle in.

1257
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,090
It's time for the next team.

1258
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,720
- Okay.
- Okay, you guys did well.

1259
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,590
(Lastly, Team Seok Jin is up.)

1260
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,860
Nicely done.

1261
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,760
- Good job.
- He was the best.

1262
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,200
- Ready, set, go.
- Okay.

1263
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,070
(Haha will draw for Team Seok Jin.)

1264
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,090
- I'll copy his exact moves.
- Yes, do so.

1265
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,930
- Go ahead.
- And...

1266
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,300
- Right.
- Good.

1267
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,740
- Okay?
- Yes, okay.

1268
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,910
(Why is Se Chan turning the page
after drawing?)

1269
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,110
He's quite good at drawing.

1270
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,820
What could that be?
It seems complicated.

1271
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,160
(Haha passionately draws.)

1272
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,410
He's quite good at drawing.

1273
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,260
What could that be?
It seems complicated.

1274
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,180
(But Se Chan doesn't copy
Haha's drawings.)

1275
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,950
- Right.
- Okay.

1276
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,220
- He's signaling them with his leg.
- That's not it.

1277
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,570
- That's cheating!
- What's wrong?

1278
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,590
- What?
- You're wrong.

1279
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,260
(Here we go!)

1280
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,510
- He's signaling them with his leg.
- That's not it.

1281
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,840
(So Min suspects foul play.)

1282
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,030
- You're wrong.
- Get over here.

1283
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,030
- You...
- He's signaling them.

1284
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,070
- He was signaling them.
- You have it wrong.

1285
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,200
Let me see that.

1286
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,740
(Before Team Seok Jin
went up as the drawing team.)

1287
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,140
Draw whatever you want
and then make a fist.

1288
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,240
- Got it.
- That's when we get serious.

1289
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,180
- I'll shift my legs.
- Okay, got it.

1290
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,320
- Sure.
- Maybe you can suddenly stand up.

1291
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,930
(And like that,
they came up with a signal.)

1292
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,760
- Come here.
- He's giving them a sign.

1293
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,430
- You can't do it.
- Just do it.

1294
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,630
- Do it.
- Wait a minute.

1295
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,070
- Look.
- This is not right.

1296
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,160
I know it.
They got this, this, and this move.

1297
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,300
No.

1298
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,430
You can't do that.

1299
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,030
How can you give a sign with feet?

1300
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,700
My goodness.

1301
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,300
My gosh.

1302
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,140
(A guard to prevent cheating)

1303
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,380
- It's okay.
- Block it, Jae Seok.

1304
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,410
I blocked it.

1305
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,450
(He blocked the cheating zone.)

1306
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,110
He's doing it with his eyes.

1307
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,990
- Do it.
- Yes. That's it.

1308
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,780
- Do it.
- Yes.

1309
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,390
(It means
he's going to pretend to draw.)

1310
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,320
That's it. Number two. Yes.

1311
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,820
- Yes.
- Number two.

1312
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,530
Is that move for number two?

1313
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,630
Hurry up.

1314
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:29,630
- You can start.
- Yes.

1315
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,220
Okay. That one.

1316
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,760
And that one.

1317
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
(He's going to draw for real now!)

1318
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,890
- Number 20.
- We got 2.

1319
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,470
- Okay.
- That's right.

1320
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,140
- I know.
- I know.

1321
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,410
- I know. A stove.
- That's right.

1322
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,010
- Yes.
- There you go.

1323
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,010
- A stove.
- Yes.

1324
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,990
- It's a crushing victory.
- After doing that...

1325
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,590
We got this.
I think we don't have a spy.

1326
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,220
- We won.
- We're first place.

1327
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,490
We don't have a spy here.

1328
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,680
- We got the final result.
- Okay. We're in second place.

1329
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,320
- We're in 2nd place.
- Team Seok Jin is in 1st place.

1330
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

1331
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,700
With 11 points.

1332
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,890
Just see if we got one or not.

1333
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,590
- Team Jae Seok is in second place.
- Okay.

1334
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,300
- With eight points.
- First place and second place only.

1335
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,200
Team So Min is in 3rd place
with 1 point.

1336
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,570
Okay.

1337
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,300
- I'll give the first place a hint.
- Yes.

1338
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,470
(The leader of the 1st-place team
checks the hint.)

1339
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,380
Without being caught.

1340
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:27,450
(Your team has a designer.)

1341
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:32,630
(One of the three is a designer.)

1342
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,660
(Is Haha who was sent
by So Min earlier the designer?)

1343
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,760
Decide if you're going to switch
team members or stay as it is.

1344
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,970
- I...
- Seok Sam will send one.

1345
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,740
I should send one member at least.

1346
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,340
- Right?
- What?

1347
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,660
- Is there a designer?
- Is there a designer?

1348
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,800
- Do we have one?
- That's why I'm sending one.

1349
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,570
That's why I'm sending a member.

1350
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,640
It's him.

1351
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,800
I said I'm not.

1352
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,340
I'm really not the one.

1353
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,610
His drawing was weird.

1354
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,680
I'm just bad at it.
But I got the stove right.

1355
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,090
(Who is the designer
hiding among the three?)

1356
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,990
- I'm not the one.
- Seok Jin.

1357
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,090
It's Jong Kook.

1358
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,550
- But...
- Jong Kook?

1359
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,890
Is it Jong Kook?

1360
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,180
- It could be Jong Kook.
- They...

1361
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:08,530
I guess they have a designer.

1362
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,030
Look at their eyes.

1363
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,700
Seok Jin, please tell us.

1364
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,820
- It's a glove.
- A glove.

1365
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,930
Sung Hun.

1366
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,340
- Yes.
- "Sung Hun?"

1367
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,860
- "Sung Hun."
- It's "Sang Hun."

1368
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,660
- Sang Hun.
- That's so rude.

1369
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,200
- Jeong Sang Hun.
- I'm sorry.

1370
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,200
Come here, Sang Hun.

1371
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,530
Back to the original members?

1372
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,450
- No, right? Or who are you...
- Me and...

1373
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:27,680
(Either Jong Kook, Haha, or Se Chan
will go to Team So Min.)

1374
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,950
You two play rock, paper, scissors.

1375
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,820
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

1376
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,220
(Win)

1377
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,340
Which one will you send?

1378
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,610
- Jong Kook.
- Okay.

1379
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:35,820
- Are you going to switch like this?
- Yes.

1380
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,450
- Switching with Sang Hun?
- The person who won.

1381
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,550
(Sang Hun from Team So Min,
Jong Kook from Team Seok Jin)

1382
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,860
- Why would he switch like this?
- Are you the designer?

1383
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,990
No, I'm not.

1384
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,300
Didn't you see how hard I worked?

1385
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,390
- You were released.
- I did it like crazy.

1386
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:48,840
- You were released.
- It doesn't make sense.

1387
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,260
Is it me?

1388
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,640
I sent the one who won.

1389
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,740
(Jae Seok, the leader of
the 2nd-place team checks the hint.)

1390
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,380
(Your team...)

1391
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:02,570
Jae Seok, are you going to switch
members or stay as it is?

1392
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,820
But you can't switch with the member
of the first-place team.

1393
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,010
- I can't?
- You can only switch with them.

1394
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,490
(He can bring
either Jong Kook or Byung Eun.)

1395
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,030
(What will Jae Seok choose?)

1396
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:18,950
- I...
- I'm really not the one.

1397
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,220
I'll keep the status quo.

1398
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,790
- You chose to stay.
- For now.

1399
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,620
(Jae Seok will keep
the team members as it is.)

1400
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,160
I'll try with them one more time.

1401
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:27,850
Really?

1402
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:30,660
(Is there no designer
in Jae Seok's team?)

1403
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:36,200
(His strategy might be switching
team members at the end.)

1404
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,580
Okay. Eat with your team members
and move on to the next mission.

1405
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,870
(They will move on to the final race
with new team members.)

1406
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,470
- Come on.
- But it is confusing.

1407
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:50,450
This is the final race where you
can get a hint about the designer.

1408
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,520
Why do they separate everyone?

1409
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,850
Individually?

1410
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,160
Are we doing it separately?

1411
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:01,890
Bombs for each member are hidden
in the training center.

1412
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,220
We should find them.

1413
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:08,240
When the designer turns on the switch,
the bomb is activated.

1414
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,040
When the time runs out,
the bomb will explode immediately.

1415
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,200
Which eliminates
the owner of the bomb.

1416
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,810
There are wires in six colors.

1417
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:22,310
One of them defuses the bomb.

1418
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,180
One of them sets the bomb off.

1419
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,120
Four of them reduce
the remaining time.

1420
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,180
Four of them reduce
the remaining time.

1421
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,330
If you have a good instinct,
you can just cut the wire.

1422
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,200
But you can get a hint about
the defusion wire by taking off...

1423
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,950
the name tag of other teams.

1424
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,720
- If you want a hint.
- I see.

1425
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,600
I should cut it,
following my instinct.

1426
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,970
If your name tag is torn off,
the remaining time...

1427
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,970
will be reduced by ten minutes.

1428
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,080
So I shouldn't let them
take mine off.

1429
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,850
And I should sneak around
to find the bomb as well.

1430
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:55,520
For your information,
only the designer can cut someone else's.

1431
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:59,750
You can cut your own wire, but only
the designer can cut someone else's.

1432
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,120
These designer punks.

1433
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,180
(Glaring)

1434
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,660
No.

1435
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,520
Before the designer activates
the bomb and cuts the wire,

1436
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,290
take off as many name tags as you
can to get hints to your advantage.

1437
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,240
I should meet someone and take off
their name tag to get a hint.

1438
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,870
Then I should find my bomb
and cut the wire based on the hint.

1439
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,270
The race is over when seven people
or more are eliminated.

1440
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,080
The rank of the team is decided
by the number of remaining members.

1441
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:31,120
Only the 1st and 2nd-place teams
can switch members.

1442
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:35,490
We could be eliminated
in ten minutes.

1443
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,560
(The final race will give them
the last chance to switch members.)

1444
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,930
Okay. I got it.

1445
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,120
Are you suspicious of anyone?

1446
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,350
Haha.

1447
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:47,540
If So Min had sent Haha,
there must've been a reason.

1448
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,640
I should be suspicious of him first.

1449
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,770
Seok Jin and I aren't the one.
It's either Se Chan or Jong Kook.

1450
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,750
Why are you suspicious of Se Chan?

1451
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,080
Se Chan is too ugly.

1452
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,850
"It's me, you jerk."

1453
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,310
Why do I like the line so much?

1454
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,850
(The suspect with a protruding mouth
is into playing Oh Tae Sik.)

1455
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:11,850
We got Name Tag Elimination
and I want a 1-on-1 with Tae Sik.

1456
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:15,020
I will fight against Tae Sik.

1457
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,270
"Tae Sik, you must be sad."

1458
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,600
I'm going to take off his name tag
from his back.

1459
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,640
I'll make you even sadder.

1460
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,560
(While Tae Sik's number 1 fan
is into the role play...)

1461
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,410
Byung Eun.

1462
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,580
(Rae Won is suspicious
of Byung Eun.)

1463
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,430
I think Byung Eun is the designer.

1464
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,310
Byung Eun.

1465
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,370
(Rae Won, Jong Kook, and So Min
are suspicious of Byung Eun.)

1466
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,540
It just feels like it.

1467
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,990
Now...

1468
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,180
(What is Byung Eun, the one
suspected the most, thinking?)

1469
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,620
I feel like Jae Seok is suspected.

1470
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,660
Or Seok Jin.

1471
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,450
I think it's the two.

1472
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,870
(He's serious by himself.)

1473
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:53,500
Okay. For taking off name tags...

1474
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,930
How do you do it?

1475
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,910
- Sorry?
- You can get a hint.

1476
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,140
The race will begin.

1477
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,200
Is it starting?

1478
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:05,870
Five.

1479
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,910
Four.

1480
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:07,950
Three.

1481
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,180
Two.

1482
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,180
One.

1483
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,850
- The race begins.
- Okay.

1484
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,250
Oh Tae Sik is back.

1485
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,790
You have no idea
where the bombs are, right?

1486
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,220
(They start searching for bombs
individually for now.)

1487
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,750
Would they have put a bomb here?

1488
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,100
No, right?

1489
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,100
What does the bomb look like?

1490
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,290
What does the bomb look like?

1491
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,290
(While everyone is focused
on finding bombs,)

1492
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,500
What would it look like?

1493
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:35,810
(the designer starts to work.)

1494
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:43,890
(The bombs are activated.)

1495
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,160
(Secretly turning on the power
of the bombs)

1496
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:54,620
(Some of the bombs
already started counting!)

1497
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:55,850
Gosh.

1498
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:56,950
Is it here?

1499
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,160
It's locked.

1500
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,160
(They're still looking for the bombs
separately in the meantime.)

1501
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,370
It's a fake.

1502
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,370
The safe.

1503
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,060
We don't need to compete against
each other. You're not the one.

1504
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,770
We don't need to compete against
each other. You're not the one.

1505
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,040
- I'm not.
- I know you're not.

1506
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,640
- They're making us compete.
- I got it.

1507
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,620
So that we will be eliminated
quickly.

1508
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,580
- Jae Seok. Watch your behind.
- Hey.

1509
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,750
I'm sorry.

1510
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,910
(Jae Seok, watch your behind!)

1511
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,890
I'm sorry. It's because it's been
a very long time.

1512
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,520
You can't do it.

1513
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,660
Without realizing,

1514
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,790
I keep thinking
that I should take it off.

1515
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,720
Rae Won, come here.

1516
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,120
Hold on.

1517
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,270
(Rae Won joins them.)

1518
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:33,560
- You punk.
- Okay.

1519
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,040
- Come here.
- Okay.

1520
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,240
- Let's not do this.
- Let's negotiate.

1521
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,310
- Let's negotiate.
- We don't have to do this.

1522
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,410
- Now, it's like...
- Let's have each other at our back.

1523
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,930
- Wait.
- Let's have each other at our back.

1524
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,310
I did it without realizing it.

1525
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:43,330
- What?
- I'm sorry. I apologize.

1526
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,450
- Let's go this way.
- You go that way.

1527
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,450
- You can't do it.
- I'm sorry.

1528
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,450
You're making a big mistake.

1529
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,750
- You're on our team. Come here.
- Come here.

1530
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,180
Come here. Se Chan, come here.

1531
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,620
- Come here.
- Oh Tae Sik!

1532
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,020
(He finally meets up
with Oh Tae Sik.)

1533
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,790
Oh Tae Sik, you are back.

1534
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,660
Oh Tae Sik, you must be sad.

1535
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,500
- There are three of us.
- What are you going to do?

1536
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,830
- Now...
- You had better watch out.

1537
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,930
I will hold Rae Won.

1538
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,330
Seok Jin.

1539
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:10,830
Hold on.

1540
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,240
- Hold on.
- Be careful.

1541
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,330
- Hold on.
- Be careful.

1542
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,330
- There is something behind you.
- Be careful.

1543
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,330
This is the beginning of the race.

1544
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,810
Don't be ridiculous.
You sent me away.

1545
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:20,270
- Seok Jin, hurry up and come here.
- Come here.

1546
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,180
- It's 4 to 3.
- Hey, Jong Kook.

1547
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,450
- Wait.
- Why?

1548
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,120
- Grab them.
- Why?

1549
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,990
- Grab them.
- Why are you getting involved?

1550
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,120
- Come here.
- For goodness' sake.

1551
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,620
Hey. Hold on.

1552
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,950
Let me ask you this.
Why did you send me away?

1553
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,020
No one worked harder than me.

1554
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,750
- It's true. I regret my decision.
- Seriously.

1555
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,200
It's strange.

1556
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,830
Hey. Hold on.

1557
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,060
All right.
I will stay out of this fight.

1558
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,140
- Same here.
- I will stay out of this fight too.

1559
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,100
- Let's fight some other time.
- That's right.

1560
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,200
Let's fight some other time.

1561
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,370
- Let's fight some other time.
- I can't believe them.

1562
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:53,680
(One man was watching the fight.)

1563
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,450
- I don't understand.
- I think you are it.

1564
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:56,640
- What? Me?
- Yes.

1565
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,020
- Why?
- You seem like a designer.

1566
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,680
You haven't seen my bomb, have you?

1567
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,220
No, I haven't.
I am searching for them.

1568
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,910
- It's okay. I am your teammate.
- Really?

1569
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:09,660
Why do I get so startled?
It's not like I committed a crime.

1570
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,120
Did I commit a crime?

1571
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,390
- For goodness' sake.
- Byung Eun.

1572
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,930
You really look like
you would be bad at fighting.

1573
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,600
Do something about your outfit.

1574
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,140
I haven't fought once in my life.

1575
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,330
People are rough.

1576
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,830
They are rough indeed.
On Running Man,

1577
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,540
people get incredibly rough
during the Name Tag Elimination.

1578
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,810
I need to find my bomb.

1579
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,220
(Jae Seok looks for his bomb.)

1580
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,520
For goodness' sake.

1581
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,680
(What?)

1582
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,830
(He finds his bomb
that hasn't been triggered yet!)

1583
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,330
(It's a special bomb
that has been made safely.)

1584
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,600
One of these wires...

1585
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,660
(The designers haven't turned on
Jae Seok's bomb yet.)

1586
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,970
defuses the bomb.

1587
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:55,000
Yes. One of the six wires
will do that.

1588
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,310
(There is only one "defuse" wire.)

1589
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:58,040
Okay.

1590
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,540
I shouldn't do anything rash.

1591
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,720
(Jae Seok leaves
after checking the location.)

1592
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,580
At least I know
the location of my bomb.

1593
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,180
So things don't happen...

1594
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,830
until the designers
turn on the bomb.

1595
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,390
What? I found it.

1596
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,720
(Did Sang Hun find something?)

1597
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,330
It's Ji Hyo's.
I found Ji Hyo's bomb.

1598
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,040
My goodness. I found Ji Hyo's bomb.

1599
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,970
Ji Hyo.

1600
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,200
(He hurriedly leaves the bomb.)

1601
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,450
Then I will take off name tags.

1602
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,310
I don't know where my bomb is.

1603
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,810
- I will find it.
- I need to find it.

1604
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,580
I know where your bomb is.

1605
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,290
- Where is it?
- It's a secret.

1606
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:41,120
I will give you ten dollars.

1607
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,560
If you tell me where mine is...

1608
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,580
- Look for mine.
- I will look for yours.

1609
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,950
I know exactly where yours is.

1610
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:50,790
(Se Chan leaves after saying
some meaningful words.)

1611
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,540
(Jae Seok searches
every nook and cranny.)

1612
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,930
What? Ji Hyo's bomb is here.

1613
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,140
(He finds Ji Hyo's bomb.)

1614
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,430
What? The timer is going.

1615
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,700
(The timer is going!)

1616
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:13,020
(When Sang Hun saw her bomb,
the timer hadn't been started.)

1617
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,750
- I need to find it.
- I know...

1618
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:19,450
(Se Chan said he knows
the location of Ji Hyo's bomb.)

1619
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:25,120
(Is one of them a designer
who started Ji Hyo's bomb?)

1620
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,870
Ji Hyo's bomb is here.

1621
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,640
Then I should tell Ji Hyo, right?

1622
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,430
Ji Hyo.

1623
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:37,000
(Jae Seok decides to tell Ji Hyo.)

1624
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,540
Ji Hyo.

1625
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:42,220
(He checks up on his bomb
while searching for Ji Hyo.)

1626
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,680
The timer is going.

1627
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,930
(Jae Seok's bomb
has been started as well.)

1628
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,680
The timer is going.

1629
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,220
Someone turned on the timer.

1630
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,290
(His bomb got turned on
just a moment ago.)

1631
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:00,430
We need to catch the designers.

1632
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,560
(He searches the premises
since the designer must be nearby.)

1633
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:05,000
How much time is left on my bomb?
Gosh, you startled me.

1634
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,200
(Byung Eun comes out of the room
Jae Seok's bomb is in.)

1635
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,910
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

1636
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,410
Hello, Jae Seok.

1637
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,020
- What are you doing here?
- Your bomb is here.

1638
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,270
- That's right.
- I was surprised.

1639
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,620
- But...
- What?

1640
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,640
why were you...
You just found my bomb.

1641
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,290
Everyone is searching
for his or her bomb.

1642
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,580
- That was what you were doing.
- Yes.

1643
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,120
(Suspicious)

1644
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,120
What is it?

1645
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,120
- It's nothing.
- You looked at me strangely.

1646
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,000
Who are the designers?

1647
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,720
- What?
- The designers...

1648
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,560
- You aren't a designer, are you?
- No, I am not.

1649
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,140
(Very suspicious)

1650
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,410
- Are you certain?
- I am not a designer.

1651
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,810
- I know who it is.
- Who is it?

1652
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,000
Sang Hun.

1653
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,950
Really?

1654
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:47,450
(Why is Byung Eun certain
that Sang Hun is a designer?)

1655
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:49,220
- Sang Hun?
- Yes.

1656
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,120
I think so. I am 90 percent sure.

1657
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,120
I have time,
so I will look around some more.

1658
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,580
Where is mine?

1659
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,720
- Haven't you found yours yet?
- No.

1660
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,520
- Hey, Sang Hun.
- Jae Seok.

1661
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,660
People say you are a designer.

1662
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,470
- That's nonsense.
- People say you are a designer.

1663
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:07,830
I am not. I swear I am not.

1664
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,740
- Where are you going?
- I am not.

1665
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,310
(Sang Hun says he isn't a designer
and leaves suddenly.)

1666
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:12,640
- You aren't?
- I swear I am not.

1667
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,770
If you aren't a designer,
why are you leaving the area?

1668
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:17,100
- Where are you going?
- I swear I am not.

1669
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:19,470
(Flustered)

1670
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,450
I don't understand.
Where are you going?

1671
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,640
(He left when he became suspected.
Is Sang Hun a designer?)

1672
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,120
Hey.

1673
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,790
You got your name tag removed
once, right?

1674
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:31,720
Your bomb got turned on.

1675
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,520
Where is my bomb?

1676
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,790
- What?
- Are you a designer?

1677
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,500
I can remove
the name tags now, right?

1678
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,770
Byung Eun, come here.

1679
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,240
(He chases after Byung Eun
right away.)

1680
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:46,040
Why would you remove my name tag?

1681
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,140
I need a hint.

1682
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,770
- Really? Did you see my bomb?
- Should I stop?

1683
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,100
- Yes.
- Where?

1684
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,200
I might stop.

1685
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,910
Byung Eun went to my university.

1686
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:58,180
Let me remove your name tag once.

1687
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,180
Go ahead.

1688
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,450
(What?)

1689
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,220
Go ahead.

1690
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,830
(Byung Eun suddenly let him remove
his name tag.)

1691
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:06,930
I removed your name tag.

1692
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,350
What happens now?

1693
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,770
Rae Won, you will receive a hint
since you removed a name tag.

1694
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:13,770
- Okay.
- My goodness.

1695
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,540
Is my bomb turned on?
Did you turn it on?

1696
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,370
- No. It was turned on.
- Really?

1697
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,830
Someone must have turned it on.

1698
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,740
(Rae Won receives a hint
on his "defuse" wire.)

1699
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,080
Among the wires,

1700
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,200
(Rae Won receives a hint
on his "defuse" wire.)

1701
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,370
the "defuse" wire isn't green.

1702
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:28,850
Okay. Maybe I should write it down.

1703
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,450
If I get lucky...

1704
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:36,580
and cut off the "defuse" wire of my bomb,
I will live forever.

1705
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:39,950
Okay. I should find my bomb.
I will cut it off no matter what.

1706
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,390
We haven't done this in a while,
so it's fun.

1707
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,790
I am excited.

1708
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,290
(The short man is excited
about the bomb race.)

1709
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,000
I will cut it off no matter what.

1710
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,660
I am lucky today.
I made many correct guesses today.

1711
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,600
(He believes in his luck
and looks for his bomb.)

1712
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,910
What? Hey. This is incredible.

1713
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,680
(He finds a bomb.)

1714
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,540
This is incredible.

1715
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,640
Someone cut off my wire.

1716
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,910
(Haha's bomb
already has the white wire cut off.)

1717
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,180
Who did it?

1718
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,180
(Haha's bomb
already has the white wire cut off.)

1719
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:16,290
(A designer cut off a "reduce" wire,
so 10 minutes have been deducted.)

1720
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,600
(Designers walk among them.)

1721
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,290
Where did I see it?

1722
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,830
Hey, Oh Tae Sik.
You had better be careful.

1723
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:24,870
(They keep taking action.)

1724
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,770
If I cut off the right wire
in four tries, I will live forever.

1725
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,140
Just avoid the "out" wire.

1726
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:33,540
Okay. Let's go. I will go ahead.

1727
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,910
I will cut the green wire first.

1728
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,180
(1 "defuse" wire, 1 "out" wire,
and 3 "reduce" wires remain.)

1729
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,580
No, the blue one.

1730
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:39,410
Here I go.

1731
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,080
One.

1732
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,080
(What could the blue line be?)

1733
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,310
Two. Please.

1734
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:45,580
Three.

1735
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,290
One, two, three. Okay.

1736
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,750
(He cut it.)

1737
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,060
Three. Okay.

1738
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,390
Oh, no!

1739
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,290
(10 minutes got deducted.)

1740
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:00,470
(He cut a "reduce" wire
and deducted 10 minutes.)

1741
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,200
(Sighing)

1742
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,600
I will cut another one.

1743
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:09,180
I will cut another one.
I am confident. The yellow one.

1744
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,580
(One of the four is
the "defuse" wire.)

1745
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,640
Here I go.

1746
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:15,290
One... No. The green one.

59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,900
One, two, three.

1747
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:21,520
(What will happen this time?)

1748
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,700
(Another 10 minutes got deducted.)

1749
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,220
Come on!

1750
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,620
(He lost 20 minutes in a moment.)

1751
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,830
No!

1752
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,410
(Haha doesn't have much time left
since he failed twice in a row.)

1753
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:34,040
I should remove someone's name tag.

1754
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,240
(Haha doesn't have much time left
since he failed twice in a row.)

1755
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,310
I will be able to guess if I remove
one more person's name tag.

1756
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:39,700
(Rae Won already received 2 hints
by removing name tags.)

1757
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,720
Is there an easy target?
I will go up to the second floor.

1758
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,540
(The 2nd floor)

1759
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,910
Where is my bomb?

1760
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:48,950
(He is the only one
who hasn't found his bomb yet.)

1761
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,580
I need to see it.

1762
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:51,620
Gosh.

1763
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:55,660
(He found an easy target.)

1764
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,290
Where is my bomb?

1765
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,830
(A sudden attack)

1766
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:03,770
(My goodness!)

1767
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,330
(Falling down)

1768
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,600
- Are you okay?
- I am okay.

1769
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,040
Gosh, you are quick.

1770
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,100
(He threw his body
and took off Seok Jin's name tag.)

1771
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,950
- Gosh.
- Seok Jin, you lose ten minutes...

1772
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,620
for getting your name tag
ripped off.

1773
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,640
Did I lose ten minutes?
Is my timer going?

1774
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,310
My timer must be going.

1775
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,220
I have to hurry up and find it.

1776
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,020
For goodness' sake. Rae Won got me.

1777
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:27,720
Maybe I will die
without seeing my bomb.

1778
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,020
Did your bomb get turned on?

1779
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,330
Well... Jong Kook.

1780
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,330
- Did your bomb get turned on?
- Not yet.

1781
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,700
- What are you doing?
- I think it got turned on.

1782
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,140
I will tell you where yours is.

1783
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,200
- Where is it?
- Then don't rip off my name tag.

1784
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:42,540
Your bomb got turned on, right?

1785
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,310
I haven't even found my bomb yet.

1786
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:45,310
- I...
- So you don't know.

1787
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,270
I got my name tag ripped off
by four people.

1788
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:49,470
- Really?
- I will tell you where yours is.

1789
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,750
Seok Jin. You don't have a chance.

1790
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,220
(The name tag hunt begins.)

1791
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,850
At this rate...

1792
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,020
For goodness' sake.

1793
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,100
Hold on.

1794
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,520
I will run out of time
and die at this rate.

1795
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:06,020
Without seeing my bomb...

1796
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,770
Without seeing my bomb, I will die.

1797
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:09,560
Hold on. I don't think
I have much time left.

1798
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,790
I need to receive a hint.

1799
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,500
Give me a hint.

1800
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,330
(Jong Kook receives a hint
after a successful hunt.)

1801
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,000
Hint!

1802
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,080
Gosh.

1803
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:21,750
I will die without seeing my bomb.

1804
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,270
I need to see my bomb
to cut off a wire or something.

1805
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:26,040
(He hurriedly looks for his bomb.)

1806
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,180
Now...

1807
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,350
Now, I have no choice...
What? It's here!

1808
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,890
(At that moment)

1809
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:32,620
Now, I have no choice...
What? It's here!

1810
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,930
(He finally finds his bomb.)

1811
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,250
(Only 15 minutes remain
on the timer!)

1812
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,470
Fifteen minutes remain.

1813
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:40,930
Gosh, what should I do? Hold on.

1814
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,140
It will be late if my name tag
gets ripped off once more.

1815
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,330
If my name tag
gets ripped off once more...

1816
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:47,640
(Should I cut off a wire or not?)

1817
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,930
I should take off
someone's name tag.

1818
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,040
Hold on.

1819
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:52,040
No.

1820
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,270
I have...

1821
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,080
two chances.

1822
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,020
Even if I fail once...

1823
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,250
If I avoid the "out" wire...

1824
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:00,640
If I avoid the "out" wire...

1825
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,180
(Solemn)

1826
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:07,790
(He becomes serious
as if it's a real bomb.)

1827
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:09,000
The blue wire.

1828
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,560
(He has 14 minutes left.)

1829
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,500
Which color should I choose? Yellow?

1830
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:13,970
White?

1831
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:18,770
(If he avoids the "out" wire,
he has two chances.)

1832
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:20,640
White.

1833
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,180
(After deliberation,
Seok Jin chooses the white wire.)

1834
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:28,270
(What's the white wire?)

1835
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,910
(He cuts it!)

1836
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,660
(It exploded.)

1837
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,100
(The wire he cut off
detonated the bomb.)

1838
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,770
Was the white one...
Was the white one the "out" wire?

1839
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,790
It was a 1 in 6 chance.

1840
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,200
This is unbelievable.

1841
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,060
(He got eliminated
with a 1 in 6 chance.)

1842
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,930
I had 2 chances
even if I chose a "reduce" wire.

1843
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,830
(He is unbelievably unlucky.)

1844
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,100
This is unbelievable.

1845
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,600
You are out.

1846
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,540
I am so unlucky.

1847
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,120
Gosh.

1848
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,620
This won't do.
I am too hot in these clothes.

1849
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:07,140
(I am too hot in these clothes.)

1850
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,490
I don't have time for this. Hold on.

1851
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,990
I need to rip off
someone's name tag.

1852
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:14,660
- I will leave it here.
- What are you doing here?

1853
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,430
- Aren't you scared of me?
- It's not like that.

1854
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,830
Don't rip off my name tag.
I have ten minutes left.

1855
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,470
- Please let go of me.
- Why do you have ten minutes left?

1856
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,000
Jong Kook, we were good together.

1857
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,910
What? I don't care about that.
This is a team competition.

1858
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:26,470
- Hold on.
- I called your name,

1859
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:28,180
- but you kept your distance.
- No, I didn't.

1860
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,870
You totally did that.

1861
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,100
- Hold on.
- I know you did that.

1862
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,370
If you do this,
I will have ten minutes left.

1863
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,580
You said earlier
that you have ten minutes left now.

1864
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,220
- Your timer hasn't started yet.
- Did you rip it off?

1865
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:40,310
- Did you rip it off?
- Se Chan, hurry up and come here.

1866
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:41,810
- What is it?
- Se Chan.

1867
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:42,990
- Behind you.
- His timer hasn't started yet,

1868
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:44,180
so it would be meaningless
to rip off his name tag.

1869
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,390
- Really? It hasn't started yet?
- No.

1870
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:46,620
- It would be meaningless.
- Really?

1871
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:47,950
- My timer hasn't started yet.
- I know...

1872
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,250
- It would be meaningless.
- Really?

1873
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,720
- My timer hasn't started yet.
- I know that it has started.

1874
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:54,370
- Haha, you lost ten minutes.
- Okay.

1875
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:56,140
(Haha lost 10 minutes.)

1876
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,310
- Put this on my back.
- Be careful.

1877
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:59,500
- Doesn't that mean...
- Is your timer going?

1878
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,700
I have eight minutes left?

1879
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:02,270
You have five minutes left.

1880
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,410
Five minutes?

1881
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:04,470
Hold on.

1882
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,270
I have five minutes left.

1883
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:11,220
I am done for
if I cut the wrong wire, right?

1884
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,810
I have five minutes left,
so I need to cut a wire.

1885
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,310
- Three wires have been cut off.
- My guess is the black one.

1886
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,580
The black one?

1887
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,160
- The black one?
- Yes. The black one.

1888
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,330
I am certain it's the black one.

1889
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:28,100
(What will Haha's choice be?)

1890
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,330
For goodness' sake.

1891
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:30,660
I will cut off the black one.

1892
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:32,100
I believe in you, Sang Hun.

1893
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,430
One, two,

1894
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,830
three.

1895
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:43,410
(Will he be able to survive
miraculously?)

1896
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,020
(Haha's bomb explodes.)

1897
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,180
What?

1898
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:49,160
What?

1899
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:51,350
The black one was the "out" wire.

1900
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,390
Which one was the "defuse" wire?

1901
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:56,930
(Team Seok Jin is at a disadvantage
since Haha got eliminated.)

1902
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,330
Gosh.

1903
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,930
Hold on.

1904
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:04,560
(Sang Hun comes to see his bomb.)

1905
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,770
Okay.

1906
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:09,680
Hold on.

1907
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,930
(However,)

1908
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,310
(one wire is cut.)

1909
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:13,750
Did my bomb explode already?

1910
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:15,410
Look at this. I almost died.

1911
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:21,410
(A designer came secretly
and cut a wire.)

1912
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,850
Hold on.

1913
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:29,200
(Despite the suspicion,
Sang Hun isn't a designer!)

1914
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,330
There is a favorite color of mine.

1915
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:32,870
(He decides to cut a wire.)

1916
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,470
Yellow.

1917
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,370
Yellow.

1918
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,310
One, two, three.

1919
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,200
Two, three.

1920
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,770
Ten minutes have been deducted.

1921
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:46,910
Gosh.

1922
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,270
(10 minutes have been deducted.)

1923
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:49,720
All right.

1924
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,270
I have 24 minutes left.

1925
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:52,620
No one knows that my bomb is here.

1926
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:54,680
Only one person knows.

1927
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,290
(Who is the designer
who cut Sang Hun's wire?)

1928
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:00,560
(Is either Byung Eun or Se Chan
a designer?)

1929
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,720
Jae Seok, when I took off...

1930
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,020
Byung Eun's name tag
for a hint earlier.

1931
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,120
he let me do it
without any resistance.

1932
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,470
Isn't Byung Eun suspicious?

1933
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:12,910
I have been suspecting him.

1934
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,770
- Byung Eun.
- From the start. Earlier,

1935
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:17,100
when we had the drawing game,
he did it very half-heartedly.

1936
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:19,580
(Please scold him.)

1937
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,970
when we had the drawing game,
he did it very half-heartedly.

1938
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,220
(He tattles in an honest way.)

1939
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,020
You are good at tattling.

1940
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,020
- Really?
- Your tone...

1941
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:30,520
- Your tone is very trustworthy.
- Okay.

1942
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,720
(Ji Hyo is looking
for her teammates.)

1943
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,220
Will you rip off my name tag again?

1944
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:38,220
No.

1945
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,600
Don't lie.
I only have 35 minutes left.

1946
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,540
- How many minutes?
- I only have 35 minutes left.

1947
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,370
Byung Eun.

1948
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:47,000
No.

1949
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,000
- No.
- Byung Eun, rip off her name tag.

1950
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,200
Come on.

1951
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,970
- Please excuse me.
- No!

1952
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,640
I am sorry.

1953
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,140
All right. Let go of me.

1954
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,450
- Let's have a 1-on-1 fight.
- A 1-on-1 fight.

1955
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:02,950
(She asks for a face-off.)

1956
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:04,520
- I don't think I have a chance.
- Let's have a 1-on-1 fight.

1957
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,080
- Your eyes look scary.
- Don't help him.

1958
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:10,350
(Ji Hyo has a chance against him.)

1959
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:12,200
Hold on. My goodness.

1960
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:14,560
- Don't kick him.
- Don't hit me.

1961
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,200
- My goodness.
- Byung Eun.

1962
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:17,640
Come on, Byung Eun.

1963
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,600
- Hold on. Excuse me.
- Hey, rip off her name tag.

1964
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,930
Hey.

1965
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,700
Jong Kook, Jae Seok is coming.

1966
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,140
(So Min joins them
with Jae Seok chasing after her.)

1967
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,140
- Jae Seok is coming.
- Jae Seok.

1968
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,680
- Hey.
- Hey.

1969
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:30,350
- Jae Seok is coming.
- Jae Seok.

1970
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,810
(Jae Seok entered a tiger's den.)

1971
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:33,220
- Hey.
- Hey.

1972
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:35,120
Jong Kook is here.

1973
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:40,220
You should have told me
that Jong Kook was here.

1974
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:43,160
(Jae Seok)

1975
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,060
(Jae Seok lost 10 minutes.)

1976
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,800
For goodness' sake. Hey.

1977
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,460
You did it.
You ripped off her name tag.

1978
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:49,960
- You did it.
- For goodness' sake.

1979
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:52,240
- Jae Seok.
- Jong Kook was next to you guys.

1980
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,630
- Didn't you see me?
- No.

1981
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,300
I was looking at you.

1982
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,910
- For goodness' sake.
- This is...

1983
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,170
I didn't see you
since your clothes were dark.

1984
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,670
- No way.
- That was the worst.

1985
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:02,010
- I couldn't rip it off again.
- All right, Jong Kook.

1986
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,470
We are in trouble.

1987
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,880
- We got taken out.
- That shouldn't happen again.

1988
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:07,640
- I shouldn't have chased after her.
- There are people.

1989
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,490
- There are people.
- No.

1990
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:11,660
It's a strategy.

1991
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:15,500
(Team Se Chan is hiding
in order to get Jong Kook.)

1992
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,760
It would become
too exhausted and sweaty...

1993
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,420
- if I challenge Jong Kook, right?
- You should do it.

1994
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,240
Give it a go.

1995
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,500
You should do it.

1996
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:26,840
- Do you want to remove my name tag?
- A 1-on-1 fight?

1997
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,380
- No.
- A 1-on-1 fight?

1998
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,540
Just in case...

1999
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:33,170
- I might remove your name tag.
- Yes.

2000
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,470
- Both of us have a chance.
- Yes.

2001
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,620
(Glancing over)

2002
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,810
Bring it on.

2003
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,310
- It's a 1-on-1 fight.
- Bring it on.

2004
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,420
All right.

2005
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:44,850
(They get caught.)

2006
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,550
Jong Kook, there are people
behind you.

2007
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,830
- Hey!
- Jong Kook.

2008
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,130
Jong Kook, there are... Stop it.

2009
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:52,420
- I said, "Bring it on."
- I knew something was off.

2010
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,460
- I knew something was off.
- Come on.

2011
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,760
- I felt like there were people.
- Let's go out.

2012
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,910
This is wrong.

2013
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:00,010
- Hey.
- Come here.

2014
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,370
Hey.

2015
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,840
Jae Seok, come here.

2016
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,740
Don't do it.

2017
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:06,670
Come on.

2018
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:08,670
(So Min)

2019
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:10,270
(So Min lost 10 minutes.)

2020
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,310
(At that moment)

2021
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:13,880
- Get him.
- Good.

2022
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,380
(Jong Kook goes for a face-off.)

2023
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,850
I got him. Rip off his name tag.

2024
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,460
- Rip off his name tag.
- Jae Seok, come here.

2025
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,590
- Hurry up.
- Rip off his name tag.

2026
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:23,090
- Jae Seok.
- Rip off his name tag.

2027
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,920
- My clothes came off.
- I ripped it off.

2028
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,130
- I ripped it off.
- Hey.

2029
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,560
I ripped it off.

2030
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,740
(Jong Kook's name tag
gets ripped off!)

2031
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,840
(Jong Kook lost 10 minutes too.)

2032
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,300
Stay put!

2033
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,430
(Byung Eun lies down.)

2034
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:38,470
Come on.

2035
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,380
(Byung Eun lost 10 minutes.)

2036
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:41,470
Jong Kook's name tag got ripped off.

2037
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,010
(Things turned chaotic
in an instant.)

2038
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,550
Did it satisfy you...

2039
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,640
to rip off my name tag like that?

2040
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,810
(Did it satisfy you
to rip off my name tag like that?)

2041
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:49,850
(Jae Seok, Rae Won, Ji Hyo, So Min,)

2042
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:50,850
(Byung Eun, Jong Kook,
Sang Hun, Se Chan)

2043
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:51,960
Oh Tae Sik.

2044
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,720
I don't know what to say to that.

2045
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:59,000
(So Min checks the time
on her bomb.)

2046
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:01,420
I have 27 minutes left.

2047
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,240
Shall I cut a wire?

2048
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,460
(She tries cutting a wire
right away.)

2049
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:06,600
Hold on.

2050
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:10,910
(Despite having no hints,
the tiger moth doesn't hesitate.)

2051
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,840
Green is my favorite color,
so I will cut the green wire.

2052
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,970
(She chooses her favorite color.)

2053
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:19,640
(So Min)

2054
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,880
(10 minutes have been deducted.)

2055
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,990
I will cut another one.

2056
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:26,830
This is the last chance.
I don't have much time left.

2057
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:28,590
(She has about 16 minutes left.)

2058
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:30,590
(Cutting the "defuse" wire
is a 1 in 5 chance.)

2059
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,560
The yellow one.

2060
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:35,630
(She chooses the yellow one.)

2061
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,410
The bomb has been defused.

2062
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:40,630
(The bomb has been defused.)

2063
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:42,630
No way.

2064
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,930
No way. I am invincible.

2065
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:47,450
I am invincible.

2066
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,620
(So Min survived.)

2067
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:51,340
- I need to make a decisive move.
- Right.

2068
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,590
- Have you seen mine?
- Yes.

2069
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:53,590
(Sang Hun is going to end the game.)

2070
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:56,590
A minute.

2071
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,310
Hurry up.

2072
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:00,330
Hurry.

2073
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:03,330
(The "defuse" wire is not red.)

2074
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:04,390
Yellow.

2075
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,870
("Defuse" wire)

2076
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:09,260
If it's not red, then it's black.
I think it's black.

2077
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,130
Black.

2078
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:12,740
Am I right?

2079
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,040
I'll trust my luck.

2080
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,300
One, two, three.

2081
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,250
(Sang Hun's bomb blew up.)

2082
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,300
Oh, my goodness.

2083
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,750
(Jeong Sang Hun)

2084
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:26,710
(He cut the "reduce" wire.
Sang Hun is out.)

2085
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:31,090
I'll blow up my own and suicide.

2086
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:32,880
It'll be funny.

2087
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,520
(He's the only one left in the team.
He decides to blow himself up?)

2088
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:36,660
Let's end the game.

2089
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:38,460
- Se Chan.
- Yes.

2090
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,700
Your "defuse" wire is...

2091
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,370
not blue.

2092
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:44,200
(The "defuse" wire is not blue.)

2093
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,300
I choose red.

2094
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,340
Red.

2095
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:50,840
(He contemplates and chooses red.)

2096
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,880
("Defuse" wire)

2097
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,910
Wait.

2098
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:56,670
(What's the red wire Se Chan chose?)

2099
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:58,950
(It blew up.)

2100
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:03,350
Why did you choose that wire
of all lines?

2101
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,120
(Everyone in Team Seok Jin is out.)

2102
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,180
Am I out?

2103
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:07,350
That's so lame.

2104
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,420
(Se Chan's acting weird.
Is he the designer?)

2105
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,200
(Seok Jin, Sang Hun,
Se Chan, and Haha are out.)

2106
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,420
Se Chan, let's go.

2107
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,670
- Did you die too?
- It was hilarious.

2108
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:19,170
Did your bomb blow up too?

2109
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,340
It blew up in front of me.

2110
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,880
How many times did you try
before it blew up?

2111
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,470
- How many times?
- Two.

2112
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:25,670
I had two left.

2113
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,640
I had three left.

2114
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,270
We can show that off here.

2115
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:30,550
I had three left.

2116
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:33,510
- "How many did you cut?" "Two."
- That ranks us.

2117
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:35,790
He blew it up at once.

2118
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:36,990
Amazing.

2119
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,120
At once.

2120
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:40,520
I think I'm the bottom here.

2121
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,050
- Life is all about one shot.
- Yes.

2122
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,220
(They all blew up their own bombs.)

2123
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,220
That's hilarious.

2124
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,800
Let's just cut it.

2125
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,090
If I'm out, that's too bad.

2126
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:50,460
(Ji Hyo in Team Jae Seok is
moving to end the game.)

2127
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,910
(Song Ji Hyo)

2128
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:58,270
(Ji Hyo has no hint
or any broken wire.)

2129
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,410
It's black.

2130
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,210
Black...

2131
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,840
Do I cut it?

2132
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,550
(Lucky Ji Hyo chooses black
without contemplation.)

2133
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:12,290
(Ji Hyo's bomb blew up.)

2134
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:13,990
I'm out.

2135
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:15,160
(Ji Hyo is out.)

2136
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,350
I must not curse.

2137
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:18,700
(Now, it's 2 versus 3.
It's advantageous for Team So Min.)

2138
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,960
No.

2139
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,960
I can't go because of Jong Kook.

2140
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,260
You can catch him.

2141
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,870
Catch him and rip off his name tag.

2142
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,300
Byung Eun can't run.

2143
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:32,010
Byung Eun. It's too dangerous.

2144
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:34,210
- I'm stuck.
- Just catch him.

2145
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:36,340
- No.
- We first...

2146
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,840
- Why not?
- No.

2147
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,050
It's our job.

2148
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:40,990
- Right. We have no choice.
- Sit down.

2149
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:43,510
- No.
- It's "Sunflower."

2150
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:45,090
- It's "Sunflower."
- "Sunflower."

2151
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:47,020
- No.
- It's "Sunflower."

2152
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,720
Sit down first.

2153
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,220
- We need to rip his name tag off.
- There's no place to jump.

2154
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,720
You should rip it off.

2155
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,260
Okay. I have no other choice.

2156
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,060
- Jong Kook.
- Come here.

2157
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,130
Jong Kook. No.

2158
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:01,540
- No.
- Wait.

2159
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,540
No.

2160
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,600
(Will Oh Tae Sik be able to
get away?)

2161
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,750
- No.
- Be careful.

2162
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,080
Wait.

2163
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,140
No.

2164
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:10,550
(Kim Rae Won)

2165
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:11,970
You lost ten minutes.

2166
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,180
(Rae Won loses 10 minutes.)

2167
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:17,120
- Let's go.
- Go, "Decibel."

2168
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,490
(The power is shifting.)

2169
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:22,800
- What are you doing here?
- I'm...

2170
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:24,590
I don't have much time left.

2171
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:26,060
What are you doing here? Come here.

2172
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,200
- Wait.
- Byung Eun.

2173
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:29,170
Wait.

2174
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:31,040
What were you doing here?

2175
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,910
- What were you doing here?
- Isn't that cheating?

2176
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:35,770
Let's go.

2177
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:37,040
Follow me.

2178
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,510
- I'll go up.
- So Min. Come here.

2179
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:39,750
- I'm okay.
- Hey...

2180
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,250
You shouldn't go around alone.
It's too dangerous.

2181
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,250
I'm...

2182
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,420
- What?
- I'm...

2183
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,310
Okay.

2184
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:46,620
(So Min is invincible
after deactivating her bomb.)

2185
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,180
I don't have much time left.

2186
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,420
It's either one.

2187
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,350
I have to end it.

2188
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,380
It's not black or red or blue.

2189
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,500
It's either yellow or white.

2190
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:59,890
(At that moment,
Byung Eun heads to his bomb.)

2191
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:03,560
(He also doesn't
have much time left.)

2192
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,800
("Defuse" wire)

2193
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,260
Then...

2194
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:08,260
(Only 3 wires remain.)

2195
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:12,300
(Going for a 30 percent chance)

2196
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,340
(Another person stands
before the bomb.)

2197
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,250
I'm going for white.

2198
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:20,590
White.

2199
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:25,460
(Someone's bomb blew up.)

2200
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,790
I cut the "out" wire.

2201
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:29,000
Now... Are you out?

2202
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:30,830
- Yes.
- How?

2203
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,560
(Byung Eun is out.)

2204
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:35,670
I thought you were the designer.

2205
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:37,700
- I cut the wire.
- Did your bomb blow up?

2206
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,840
It blew up.

2207
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,060
(Byung Eun's bomb blew up?)

2208
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:47,250
(Park Byung Eun)

2209
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:51,950
(Byung Eun cut the "out" wire.)

2210
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:54,680
(He might not be the designer.)

2211
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:56,010
White.

2212
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,680
The bomb is deactivated.

2213
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:59,790
Okay!

2214
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:00,920
(The bomb is deactivated.)

2215
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,720
I'm immortal, right?

2216
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,800
Yes.

2217
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,390
I'm immortal.

2218
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,890
Let me go cut it.

2219
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,060
(Rae Won is off to end the game...)

2220
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,740
(after hearing Jae Seok
deactivated his bomb.)

2221
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:15,260
I got three hints.

2222
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:17,130
(He has 20 minutes left.)

2223
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:18,300
Should I cut it?

2224
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,800
(He tries to deactivate it.)

2225
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:26,880
(Rae Won got 3 hints
from ripping off name tags.)

2226
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,160
Green.

2227
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,160
Blue.

2228
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,160
(If he cuts the "defuse" wire,
he wins.)

2229
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,160
Black.

2230
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:34,680
(So far, 6 people are out.)

2231
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,220
(With 1 more person out,
the race ends.)

2232
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,390
(If Rae Won is out,
Team So Min wins.)

2233
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:41,420
Yellow it is.

2234
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,630
(If Rae Won deactivates it,
Team Jae Seok wins.)

2235
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:43,740
What do I do?

2236
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:46,170
(This will determine the result.)

2237
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:47,800
One, two, three.

2238
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:50,880
(What's the result?)

2239
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,510
It blew up.

2240
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:59,510
(Rae Won is out.)

2241
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,210
Why did I have to choose that?

2242
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,880
- Good.
- Nice.

2243
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,010
Is it over now?

2244
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:06,260
The race is over.

2245
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,200
With seven people out in total,

2246
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,260
the winner is Team So Min
with only one person out.

2247
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,560
Who's out?

2248
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,060
- Byung Eun.
- Me.

2249
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,410
My goodness.

2250
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:21,670
I mean...

2251
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,540
When did you get eliminated?

2252
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:25,210
How did you get eliminated?
Did you cut the wire?

2253
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,770
- Yes.
- I see.

2254
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,210
Seriously.

2255
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:29,420
He was out?

2256
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:30,840
Does that mean
he's not the designer?

2257
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:34,490
Second place goes to Team Jae Seok.

2258
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:35,510
(Team Jae Seok places 2nd.)

2259
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,510
We all cut the bomb and blew it up.

2260
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,550
- We all blew it up.
- Third place goes to...

2261
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,180
Team Seok Jin where everyone is out.

2262
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:44,850
- We love fireworks.
- We love to cut wires.

2263
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:46,200
Did you all major in engineering?

2264
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

2265
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,760
- In just one go.
- We go crazy when we see wires.

2266
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,870
We can't wait to cut it.

2267
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:54,460
First place can change two people.

2268
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:57,580
Second place can change one person.

2269
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,580
(Team So Min can change 2 people.
Team Jae Seok can change 1 person.)

2270
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:03,250
- We have a strong suspect.
- So Min?

2271
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:05,620
(Strong suspect)

2272
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,710
Isn't the answer obvious?

2273
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:08,010
- The answer is obvious.
- Yes.

2274
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,160
What's there to think?

2275
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,620
Isn't it strange that he's out?

2276
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:13,520
Maybe it was his strategy.

2277
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,130
You don't know
if the spy is here or not.

2278
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,460
I don't know.
I'm sending both of them.

2279
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,170
(She'll change all her members.)

2280
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:22,340
- Me too?
- You're not even ridiculous.

2281
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,460
Me?

2282
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,260
You're not even ridiculous.

2283
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,460
- I know.
- Me?

2284
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:29,100
I chased you like crazy,
and you're letting me go?

2285
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,080
I think I should
let both of them go.

2286
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:34,800
I want to let both of them go.

2287
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,640
- Oh, you're the captain.
- I'm the captain.

2288
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,310
- That's so cool.
- But I...

2289
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:41,490
But I eliminated
so many people here.

2290
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,590
Jong Kook.
All your efforts went to waste.

2291
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:46,550
- No, wait...
- Me?

2292
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,660
(He's about to get discarded
after making her win.)

2293
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,920
I'll send Jong Kook back
to his original team.

2294
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,500
- Why?
- Why?

2295
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,090
- Am I going back?
- I'll bring Haha.

2296
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:54,200
Thank you.

2297
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,840
Why are you letting me go?

2298
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,840
- If I send them both...
- Don't make eye contact.

2299
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,870
(With Jong Kook)

2300
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:01,510
- They both...
- Why did you take Haha?

2301
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:03,430
- Because it's clear it's not me.
- I'll also let Byung Eun go.

2302
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:04,430
- To where?
- To where?

2303
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:05,430
(Who will she bring
instead of Byung Eun?)

2304
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:07,250
How about him?

2305
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:10,670
Choose someone
who isn't the designer for sure.

2306
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,310
- I think it's not Ji Hyo for sure.
- That's right.

2307
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:13,840
- Bring someone who isn't.
- I'll trade him with Ji Hyo.

2308
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,090
- Ji Hyo?
- You may trade them.

2309
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:16,120
- It's not Ji Hyo?
- I think she isn't.

2310
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,810
Byung Eun.
You're back to Team Jae Seok.

2311
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:19,850
Like this.

2312
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:23,590
Haha could be the designer.

2313
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:25,330
- Never.
- That's possible.

2314
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,060
But Haha said...

2315
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,460
- Wait.
- Don't say that.

2316
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:32,840
Jae Seok. Now you can trade...

2317
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,340
someone from the bottom team.

2318
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,410
(Who will he send
and who will he bring?)

2319
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:38,740
You're the captain.

2320
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,450
- Right.
- Can he keep the team?

2321
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:41,640
- Yes.
- Jae Seok.

2322
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,550
I have no idea who it is.

2323
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:45,270
- Me too.
- I have no idea.

2324
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:48,680
I think you should let Byung Eun go.

2325
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,790
(Rae Won suggests him
to let Byung Eun go.)

2326
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:53,420
Byung Eun did act weird.

2327
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,830
- Isn't it Rae Won?
- I don't think it's Rae Won.

2328
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,130
- No.
- It could be Rae Won.

2329
01:20:58,130 --> 01:20:59,760
- No.
- He's very good at this.

2330
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,960
But I think...

2331
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,020
He keeps a poker face.

2332
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,800
They're both nervous.

2333
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,800
It's not him
based on the hint I got.

2334
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,600
- What did the hint say?
- It's not whom?

2335
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,910
My second hint said...

2336
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:13,550
there was no designer in my team.

2337
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:19,750
(Jae Seok received a hint
after the mission.)

2338
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:25,120
(Your team doesn't have a designer.)

2339
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:28,960
(At the time, Ji Hyo and Rae Won
were in Team Jae Seok.)

2340
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,830
I had Ji Hyo and Rae Won.

2341
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:32,520
- That means...
- It makes sense.

2342
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,720
Exactly.

2343
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,830
It's obvious now.

2344
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,500
It's obvious now.
What's there to think?

2345
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,800
If there wasn't one,
send Byung Eun to the other team.

2346
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,040
You can't bring Ji Hyo back anyway.

2347
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,010
- I'm not sure about whom to bring.
- Me?

2348
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:43,080
From this team?

2349
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,600
- It can't be the captain.
- No.

2350
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,550
Jong Kook... I have no idea.

2351
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:50,770
Jong Kook?

2352
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,680
(Jong Kook's face says
he shouldn't bring Se Chan.)

2353
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,680
Jong Kook? I have no idea.

2354
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,020
Jong Kook? Is it Jong Kook?

2355
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,630
I thought it was Jong Kook,
but now I think it's Haha.

2356
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:04,720
- I swear I'm not a designer.
- I hope you're not.

2357
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,220
- I think it's Jong Kook.
- I pick Se Chan.

2358
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:08,670
- Okay!
- I pick Se Chan.

2359
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:10,340
- Who's going?
- Byung Eun.

2360
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:11,870
- Se Chan?
- Go.

2361
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:13,340
- I swear.
- I knew it.

2362
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,240
- You're not a designer, are you?
- You know me.

2363
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,880
I'm not a designer. Thank you.

2364
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,600
- Are you done choosing your team?
- Yes.

2365
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:21,600
- The teams are fixed now.
- It's not you, right?

2366
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,920
Today's penalty is the last bomb
installed by the bomb designers.

2367
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,640
It's the water bomb.

2368
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,050
Each team should stand
under the bomb.

2369
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:30,810
- Each team?
- Gosh, this is really...

2370
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:31,810
In teams?

2371
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:33,420
My goodness.

2372
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,850
- Jae Seok.
- This is so nerve-wracking.

2373
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:37,220
- Gosh.
- You should gather around.

2374
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,220
Okay.

2375
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:41,020
- You're not a designer, are you?
- No, I'm not.

2376
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:44,060
If the two designers are
on different teams,

2377
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:46,010
- the citizens in those teams...
- The designers don't get splashed.

2378
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:47,630
- will get the water bomb.
- Two designers.

2379
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,710
If the two designers are
on the same team,

2380
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:53,670
all the team members
will get the water bomb.

2381
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:55,510
- One.
- I'm so nervous.

2382
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:57,380
- Two.
- My gosh.

2383
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,510
Three.

2384
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,460
(Only Team Seok Jin gets splashed.)

2385
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,830
- Darn it.
- I told you.

2386
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:15,390
Today's bomb designers were
Kim Jong Kook and Park Byung Eun.

2387
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,660
It's them.

2388
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,660
(Today's bomb designers,
Kim Jong Kook, Park Byung Eun!)

2389
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:21,560
(The 2 bomb designers
sneaked into Running Man.)

2390
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:27,040
(And they installed
the members' bombs in advance.)

2391
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:33,380
(They turned on the bombs secretly
at the beginning of the race.)

2392
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:37,920
(They avoided
everyone's eyes like that.)

2393
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,490
(And the designers
activated the bombs.)

2394
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:42,990
You two...

2395
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:45,830
are the bomb designers
who sneaked into Running Man.

2396
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:47,350
You should be on different teams...

2397
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:50,520
at the end of the race
hiding your identities.

2398
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:53,870
If you end up on the same team,
you will lose and get the penalty.

2399
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:57,130
We should be on different teams.

2400
01:23:57,130 --> 01:23:59,800
After each mission,
only the captains of each team...

2401
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,240
will get a hint about the designers
and a chance to switch members.

2402
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,470
You should stop the captains
from getting a hint...

2403
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:09,640
and make the other team members
look suspicious.

2404
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,840
I see.

2405
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:15,350
(Byung Eun was
not competitive at all.)

2406
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,220
(When he gave the right answer...)

2407
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,850
(Lukewarm)

2408
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,920
(When the other team
gave the right answer,)

2409
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,000
(he seemed very excited.)

2410
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,090
(He stayed calm even when he had
his name tag ripped off.)

2411
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:34,600
(When Jae Seok almost caught him,)

2412
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:38,270
(he escaped the crisis
by framing Sang Hun.)

2413
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:43,470
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook took
the opposite strategy.)

2414
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:47,750
(He tried his best for the missions
to avoid any suspicion.)

2415
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:50,880
(However...)

2416
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,200
(Jong Kook and Byung Eun were
put on the same team.)

2417
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,390
(They didn't expect this to happen.)

2418
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:58,870
How did that happen?

2419
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:02,500
I tried my best to avoid suspicion.

2420
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,910
And I was hoping to be switched
at the last minute.

2421
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:07,370
Things were going just as I planned.

2422
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:10,380
So Min, listen to me. Now...

2423
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:11,880
we are on the same team.

2424
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,750
Let's say... What if...

2425
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,670
the two of us are the designers?

2426
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:19,990
Then what should you do to survive?

2427
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,210
There's nothing you can do
in this situation.

2428
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:25,850
Then you have to tell me the truth.

2429
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,830
So I'm telling you now.

2430
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:30,000
- She should understand it by now.
- Are you two the designers?

2431
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,590
No way. That's highly unlikely.

2432
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:33,720
The chances are so slim.

2433
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,840
Do you want to survive?

2434
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,700
You should win
first place in the mission.

2435
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,930
Then you can send us
to another team.

2436
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,080
That way, you can survive
and we can survive too.

2437
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:48,050
(With So Min on their side,
they started a joint strategy.)

2438
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:49,470
(They cut the wires of the other members
to shorten their lives.)

2439
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:50,810
Okay.

2440
01:25:52,880 --> 01:26:00,550
(They removed their name tags
whenever they got the chance.)

2441
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:04,000
(That's how they won
1st place in the mission.)

2442
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,670
(And So Min sent them
to other teams.)

2443
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:12,010
(While the designers were happy...)

2444
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:15,240
(There was no designer on my team.)

2445
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:19,550
(The designers forgot
about Jae Seok's hint.)

2446
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:22,010
(With Jae Seok's choice,)

2447
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:25,490
(the 2 designers
got together again.)

2448
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:28,290
(Their plans went down the drain
because of Jae Seok.)

2449
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:29,990
It was them.

2450
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:32,290
- Jae Seok chose it.
- This is unbelievable.

2451
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:34,130
- I knew you weren't the designer.
- I'm sorry, Haha.

2452
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:35,630
I wasn't the designer.

2453
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:38,300
Team Jae Seok and Team So Min
avoided the designers...

2454
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:40,020
- The water is warm.
- with their hawk eyes.

2455
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:43,040
- So they get the prize.
- Yes!

2456
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,200
(Team So Min and Team Jae Seok
get the prize.)

2457
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,460
- Please bring in the prize.
- It's been a long time.

2458
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:48,880
The prize is crabs.

2459
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,380
It's soy sauce marinated crabs.

2460
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:52,270
- Soy sauce marinated crabs?
- Yes.

2461
01:26:52,270 --> 01:26:53,270
This is nice.

2462
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:55,550
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2463
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:57,550
- This is it for today.
- Yes!

2464
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,840
- Thank you.
- We had a lot of fun.

2465
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,420
