1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,920
- So this is it.
- These are cereals.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,630
- Hello.
- I should eat cereals.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,160
- I will eat them too.
- I want cereals.

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,090
- Hello.
- What is all this?

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,090
- Look at this.
- Who sent this?

6
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,170
- It's from Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk bought it.

7
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,330
- Why?
- Why all of a sudden?

8
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,690
- To cheer you up.
- Hello.

9
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,670
- All of a sudden?
- For no reason?

10
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,130
I've never seen a coffee truck
that serves this.

11
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,400
I know.

12
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,840
- It costs a lot.
- This is...

13
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,930
- My gosh.
- Hello.

14
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,040
Those who live
in Apgujeong are different.

15
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,150
I drink iced Americano
no matter how cold it is.

16
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,090
Hello.

17
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,950
It's strange that
he's suddenly being nice to us.

18
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,750
Jae Suk got us a coffee truck.

19
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,880
If your husband is
suddenly nice to you,

20
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,190
that means he's having an affair.

21
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,320
Why is he doing this
all of a sudden?

22
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,630
Is Jae Suk your husband?

23
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,700
I'm just giving you an example.
Why is he being so nice?

24
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,920
What's with him? This is strange.

25
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,170
I paid for it.

26
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,940
- Thank you, Jae Suk.
- All right.

27
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,170
- Thank you.
- Hey.

28
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,030
(Suk Jin and the one who paid
for the coffee truck show up.)

29
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,170
- Hey.
- You look great today.

30
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,140
- I do?
- I like your cardigan.

31
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,810
Why are you saying that?

32
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,550
I'm just saying that
because it's pretty.

33
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,050
- He's conscious of what people say.
- It looks pretty.

34
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,560
And I like your white cap.
It looks good on you.

35
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,710
What's going on?

36
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,560
- Why are you...
- I like your outfit.

37
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,730
- That's enough.
- And you smell nice today.

38
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,790
Your shoes are pretty too.

39
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,150
Look at your pants.

40
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,070
- By the way...
- You look so cute.

41
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,370
- That's enough.
- Hey.

42
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,900
- It's true that it's pretty.
- It's true.

43
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,400
- Why are you being like this?
- I'm not joking.

44
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,540
I'm saying this because it's pretty.

45
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,930
As soon as you got off the car,

46
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,510
I was surprised to find out
that we're wearing the same color.

47
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,130
- Don't be so self-conscious.
- I was like, "It's pretty."

48
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,850
- That's enough.
- Suk Jin, I like your voice.

49
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,420
- You have a nice voice.
- My voice was always like this.

50
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,820
So yesterday...

51
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,790
Jae Suk, why did you buy this?

52
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,180
- Why is that?
- Why all of a sudden?

53
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,420
- You know what?
- Tell us.

54
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,090
He has nothing to spend money on.

55
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,460
- He's got nowhere to spend...
- I saw him...

56
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,460
looking for places
where he could spend money.

57
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,320
He doesn't buy clothes
or eat something expensive.

58
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,900
- He doesn't need money.
- The thing is,

59
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,290
I wanted to cheer up
our production staff.

60
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,290
Everything is going well.

61
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,540
- What's wrong with them?
- Everything's fine.

62
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,960
They are applauding.

63
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,430
I wanted to express my gratitude
at the end of the year.

64
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,400
Are you doing this to win
the Grand Award?

65
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,920
Then I would've sent it to the CEO.

66
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,880
By the way, Suk Jin, are you
expecting to win an award this year?

67
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,750
- Are you?
- You deserve one this year.

68
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,980
- Right. This year...
- The Grand Award?

69
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,190
- Just stay quiet.
- He deserves it.

70
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,790
- The Grand Award.
- This year...

71
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,850
I'm not doing this to win an award.

72
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,850
They are not doing this
for an award either.

73
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,350
Did I work hard
to win an award then?

74
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,860
- You deserve one.
- Even if I win,

75
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,260
it's not like I get a pay raise.

76
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,170
- You do get a pay raise.
- He got a raise.

77
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,290
- Suk Jin.
- He also got meal tickets.

78
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,940
I got a pay raise
after I won an award.

79
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,700
When I won
the Honorary Employee Award,

80
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,940
I only got four sacks of rice.

81
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,800
- Did you get rice?
- You did?

82
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,070
(Did you get rice?)

83
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,780
- I did.
- You did?

84
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,250
- You didn't get one?
- No, I didn't.

85
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,480
- I got rice.
- My gosh.

86
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,950
- Really?
- You got four sacks of rice?

87
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,720
Is that right, Hyung In?
You get four sacks of rice a year.

88
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,760
- That's true.
- The employees get it.

89
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,260
- That's what I got.
- Really?

90
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,820
Do the employees get rice?

91
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,420
- Really?
- That's what I got.

92
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,000
That's the benefit
for the SBS employees.

93
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
That's nice.

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,730
And we got beef jerky from SBS.

95
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,730
That's from the director.

96
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,630
- It tasted really good.
- It was Korean beef jerky.

97
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,330
Right. The beef jerky
from the director.

98
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,040
You got the beef jerky
thanks to Running Man.

99
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,850
You don't get
things like that elsewhere.

100
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,910
It's only for major TV shows.

101
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,070
- Suk Jin.
- I sometimes get apples.

102
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,980
He has money to buy
his own beef jerky.

103
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,540
When I was sick
and got hospitalized,

104
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,790
I got a fruit basket.

105
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,010
- Really?
- From whom?

106
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,190
- From SBS.
- The director.

107
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,630
- Right. That's what you got.
- Really?

108
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,160
Yes. I got a fruit basket.

109
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,550
- That's Director Choi Young In.
- She's very thoughtful.

110
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,820
I'm so disappointed.

111
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,170
When I was sick,
she didn't send me anything.

112
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,100
- When were you sick?
- When was that?

113
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,330
She wouldn't send it
just for a cold or something.

114
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,170
- It's not like that.
- Were you sick?

115
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,860
- When I was hospitalized.
- When was that?

116
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,640
- When were you hospitalized?
- When were you so sick?

117
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,640
- Why were you sick secretly?
- I was hospitalized,

118
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,320
- so I skipped the shoot once.
- What? You did?

119
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,720
- When was that?
- When were you sick?

120
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,040
- Was it ten years ago?
- When Girls' Generation was here.

121
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,160
- When Girls' Generation was here?
- So you called me.

122
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
(It was 11 years ago.)

123
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,050
- Girls' Generation?
- It was like a party.

124
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,160
That was a long time ago.

125
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,030
It was like a party
when Girls' Generation was here.

126
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,530
I still remember them.

127
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,170
It was even before they joined.

128
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,540
It was before we joined.

129
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,440
Today, we are having the guests...

130
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,880
who will make some of you
go wild for sure.

131
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,540
- What?
- Really?

132
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,540
Really?

133
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,540
- Bring in the first guest.
- Is it me?

134
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,150
(The first guest shows up.)

135
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,890
- Someone's coming. It's a woman.
- Where?

136
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,940
- What?
- My goodness.

137
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,160
Is she from the drama,
"One Dollar Lawyer?"

138
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,350
(That's her!)

139
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,050
That's right. She's from
"One Dollar Lawyer."

140
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,850
- Look at her.
- She's Ji Eun.

141
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,460
- How did her hair get so long?
- Hello.

142
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,060
- I'm surprised.
- Hello.

143
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,190
Hello.

144
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,140
- Hello.
- Hello. I'm a big fan.

145
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,340
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

146
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,230
(The heroin from the SBS drama,
"One Dollar Lawyer")

147
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,040
(She's a rising star who captivated
viewers with her lively charm.)

148
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
(Actress Kim Ji Eun)

149
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,350
- Hello.
- Her acting is brilliant.

150
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,680
Ji Eun. My gosh.

151
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,350
She's so good at acting drunk.

152
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,460
She had short hair in the drama.

153
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,920
- Right. I had short hair.
- This is amazing.

154
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,330
Did you get a hair piece?

155
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,620
- Yes. For another drama.
- I can't believe she's here.

156
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,730
We have the second guest.

157
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,360
- Do we have another guest?
- Really?

158
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
- I didn't get to see who it is.
- Really?

159
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,990
So Min seems very excited.

160
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,490
- You don't know who it is?
- Bring in the second guest.

161
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,670
- Hello.
- Who is it?

162
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,230
- I just heard.
- She doesn't know the guest.

163
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,300
- They didn't let them meet.
- I won't go wild easily.

164
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,370
Someone's coming.

165
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,910
(Someone's coming.)

166
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,330
- Hello.
- Someone's coming.

167
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,810
That's Cho Sae Ho.

168
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,140
- My gosh.
- Darn it.

169
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,770
- What is he doing?
- Gosh.

170
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,870
- It's Cho Sae Ho.
- That's Cho Sae Ho.

171
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,190
- My gosh.
- Darn it.

172
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,690
- What is he doing?
- Gosh.

173
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,860
I thought...

174
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,710
I thought I smelled something sour.

175
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,080
Look at her face.

176
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,620
(She's the only one
who welcomes him.)

177
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,950
Why are you dressed up?

178
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,760
- Look at her.
- They said, "Darn it."

179
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,620
- What?
- Look at Ji Hyo's face.

180
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,800
Ji Hyo. These two...

181
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,460
- Does he have shares or what?
- Why is his jacket so tight?

182
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,330
- Why is he coming here so often?
- What's with his outfit?

183
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,700
Hey, he's wearing a school uniform.

184
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,250
My gosh. Even from over there,

185
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,770
- Why are you in a school uniform?
- I could hear your boos.

186
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,370
I could hear that even from there.

187
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,750
This is a Japanese school uniform.

188
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,640
Hello.

189
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,510
- Hello.
- What's with your outfit?

190
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,210
- What is this?
- That's a Japanese style.

191
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,710
- He's Japanese.
- Isn't this a Japanese uniform?

192
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,060
This is not acceptable.
Go get changed.

193
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,930
- This is a Japanese uniform.
- This is unisex.

194
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,450
Isn't this what G-DRAGON wears?

195
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,690
- This is a Japanese style.
- G-DRAGON wears this.

196
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,370
- This is not a Japanese style.
- This is Japanese...

197
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,800
- Is that Chanel?
- Look at his shoes.

198
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,260
- Nice to meet you.
- Aren't these your shoes?

199
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,440
Did you give him the shoes?

200
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,700
Am I standing here
when I'm the guest?

201
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,960
Sae Ho, come over here.

202
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,500
- Can I go there?
- You sent there yourself.

203
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,540
As soon as I got here...

204
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,810
- You went there yourself.
- Right.

205
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,810
This is Chanel.

206
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,370
- You look cute today.
- It's too tight for you.

207
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,610
I was excited to be on Running Man
after a long time,

208
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,870
- By the way...
- You look cute.

209
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,050
so I chose expensive clothes.

210
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,420
You look really lovely.

211
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,550
So Min, today...

212
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,690
- You're frowning.
- No, I'm happy.

213
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,950
I thought you weren't feeling well,
but that wasn't the case.

214
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,360
- Right. That's because of you.
- No, I'm happy.

215
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,950
I'm really excited to see him.

216
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,230
I'm sorry.

217
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,870
- I'm really glad.
- All right then.

218
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,520
We have Ji Eun and Sae Ho here.

219
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,670
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

220
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,500
- What brought these two together?
- Why is Sae Ho here?

221
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,110
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- What do they have in common?

222
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,370
- Did they do a drama together?
- Ji Eun.

223
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,110
I heard you rearranged your schedule
to be on our show.

224
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,050
Thankfully, I was supposed
to start my next drama right away.

225
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,620
But they agreed to wait.
I really wanted to be here.

226
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,920
- Seriously...
- So are you happy to be here?

227
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,440
- Yes.
- What?

228
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,450
- So are you happy to be here?
- Yes.

229
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,290
- Why would you ask that?
- What was that?

230
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,360
- I'm happy.
- This is what we do here.

231
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,190
- You can have fun.
- He sounds so mean.

232
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
- Why would you ask that?
- What was that?

233
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,820
He's being so mean.

234
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,740
- Stop it.
- My gosh.

235
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,000
How can I possibly stop it?

236
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,410
- Look at Jong Kook.
- She just got here.

237
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,630
Jong Kook tells him to stop.

238
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,700
Stop what?

239
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,270
- How can I stop it?
- That's enough.

240
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,980
I have to talk to him.

241
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,510
If there's anything
you want to say, just say it.

242
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,980
Go ahead and say it.

243
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,510
By the way, Ji Eun recently
finished her drama.

244
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,060
- That's "One Dollar Lawyer."
- That was amazing.

245
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,560
- She had short hair in the drama.
- That was...

246
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,820
- Right.
- It's "One Dollar Lawyer."

247
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,750
Did anything change
after the drama was over?

248
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,870
Yes. The drama was
loved by a lot of people.

249
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,060
So many people recognize me
even when I don't wear any makeup.

250
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,060
- Really?
- I see.

251
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,190
Wasn't it like that before?

252
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,200
No. Only a few fans
recognized me before.

253
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,500
But many people recognize me now.

254
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,480
Once you join Running Man,

255
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,200
people will recognize you
even when you wear a cap and a mask.

256
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,480
- Really?
- Gosh, Suk Jin.

257
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,070
You're right about that.

258
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,920
- Gosh, Suk Jin.
- You're right about that.

259
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,160
- Exactly.
- Stop it.

260
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,420
Listen to him carefully.

261
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,190
- Listen to him carefully.
- That's enough.

262
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,690
- He's right.
- Are you making fun of him?

263
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,260
Just criticize me instead.

264
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,130
- I like what you said.
- I said something silly.

265
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,990
- What you just said was great.
- My gosh.

266
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,860
Anyway,

267
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,410
even her family at home...

268
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,600
is treating her differently now.

269
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,100
They call me Actress Kim.

270
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,740
And my aunts asked me
for my autograph.

271
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,380
- That never happened before.
- That happens a lot.

272
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,440
- That's the change.
- All of a sudden.

273
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,610
They ask for your autograph.

274
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,190
I'm sorry, but do you want me
to stay out of this?

275
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,740
There's nothing
I can do in the middle.

276
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,420
- I just say, "Oh."
- What are you talking about?

277
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,220
- Please keep doing that.
- Okay.

278
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,890
- Please keep saying that.
- I'm sorry.

279
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,480
- Sae Ho, already...
- You are up next.

280
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,220
By the way, what are you doing here?

281
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,490
- Shouldn't you be in school?
- What school?

282
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,220
You know
which high school you go to.

283
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,300
Ji Eun's outfit and mine...

284
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,360
- are similar in style.
- No, it's not.

285
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,170
- In what way?
- We have similar patterns.

286
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,040
- The patterns are similar.
- I see.

287
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,680
So do you have
anything to do with Ji Eun?

288
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,330
- No.
- About Ji Eun...

289
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,340
Lee Dong Wook is
a close friend of mine.

290
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,810
- Right. I heard that.
- And Ji Eun did a drama with him.

291
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,410
It's called "Strangers from Hell."

292
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,310
- Did you watch the drama?
- I did.

293
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,890
Really? What was her character?

294
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,080
- Why are you doing this?
- You really don't know?

295
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,690
- Why are you upset?
- You can't be a star like that.

296
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,220
- Why are you being like that?
- I don't need to be a star.

297
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,930
- Why are you lying?
- Isn't that your goal?

298
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,460
- She was Im Si Wan's girlfriend.
- Exactly.

299
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,690
I heard a lot about you.

300
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,900
- Really?
- What did you hear?

301
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,490
- That they were close friends.
- I see.

302
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,830
And you two meet often
at the end of the year.

303
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,330
- That's true.
- Why at the end of the year?

304
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,360
I heard he was really fun.

305
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,180
- Dong Wook praised her a lot.
- What did he say?

306
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,570
This is it for today.

307
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,880
- You don't need the details.
- I want the details.

308
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,310
This is about Dong Wook.

309
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,340
It's okay because it's a compliment.

310
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,810
He says she works harder
than anyone else.

311
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,660
- And that...
- He's just making things up.

312
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,850
- Who wouldn't work hard here?
- Right.

313
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,350
He doesn't work so hard.

314
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,320
- Hey!
- You didn't work hard, did you?

315
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,590
(He got a blow after a long time.)

316
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,220
- He works really hard.
- I'm sorry.

317
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,590
- I'm just experienced.
- He's really hard-working.

318
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,360
- I just hit it and quit it.
- I'm sorry.

319
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,590
- I'm a pro.
- That's what he does.

320
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,010
- Okay. I get it.
- I hit it and quit it.

321
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,640
He does his own part.

322
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,540
By the way, the thing is...

323
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,310
Actually, the two people
I tried fixing up together were...

324
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,280
- Sae Ho...
- So Min.

325
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,840
- and So Min.
- Why does it have to be me?

326
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,290
- Why didn't it work?
- They both weren't interested.

327
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,810
Sae Ho refused it.

328
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,790
- Right.
- I don't like him either.

329
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,080
- I know.
- I hate it even more.

330
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,820
Why do you hate it even more?

331
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,220
(I hate it even more.)

332
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,300
Why do you hate it even more?

333
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,060
Why would you hate
to go out with me?

334
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,300
- Why are you doing this to So Min?
- I hate it too.

335
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,800
How dare you not like her?

336
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,440
- Do I have to like her?
- Who do you think you are?

337
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,910
- I get it.
- That darn brat.

338
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,380
- Sae Ho is...
- All right.

339
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,380
- How dare you?
- This is what upsets So Min.

340
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,310
- She's not interested in him,
- Exactly.

341
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,610
but he refused her.
That makes her feel terrible.

342
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,940
- Right.
- How dare you refuse So Min?

343
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,440
If So Min really wants to go out
with me, I could give it a thought.

344
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,290
- But she's not like that.
- I hate this too.

345
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,520
I hate the way
he's thinking right now.

346
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
- Why?
- Why should I want to go out?

347
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,260
Then why are you
so dressed up today?

348
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,990
She got the wrong information.

349
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,060
- The information...
- She was misinformed.

350
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,320
I think she heard
Jinyoung of GOT7 would come.

351
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,640
Will you go out with me once?

352
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,640
I won't!

353
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,960
Go away!

354
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,810
"I won't."

355
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,880
(The tragic ending)

356
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
- I'll eat with Nam Chang Hee.
- "I won't."

357
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,280
- That's funny.
- That's hilarious.

358
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,020
Ji Eun became popular
with her line, "You darn jerk!"

359
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,310
- "You darn jerk!"
- "You darn jerk!"

360
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,650
You darn jerk!

361
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,950
I heard she wanted to say that
to one of the members.

362
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,580
- The exact line?
- Ji Eun.

363
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,130
- It's the famous line.
- Who is it?

364
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,450
- You need a partner.
- What about Sae Ho?

365
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,660
What about Sae Ho?

366
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,630
- I think that would be nice.
- Okay. Good.

367
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,900
- Ji Eun, speak your line to him.
- Okay.

368
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,640
- But how...
- It's a famous line.

369
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,490
- It's from a drama.
- I know it's a famous line.

370
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,010
- I don't find it offensive.
- She doesn't mean it.

371
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,040
You darn jerk!

372
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,140
You darn jerk!

373
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,780
(Flinching)

374
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,050
- I like the tone of her voice.
- "You darn jerk!"

375
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,920
- You've got the vibe.
- "You darn jerk!"

376
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,080
- She sounds like an old fossil.
- She's got the vibe.

377
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,310
- She's not just saying that.
- You're right.

378
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,690
It comes from deep within.

379
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,080
- That's explosive.
- She's different.

380
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,190
When Ji Hyo says that,
she even makes the face.

381
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,630
Ji Hyo, show us.

382
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,900
You darn jerk.

383
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,630
You darn jerk.

384
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,900
That's new. She's different.

385
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,130
- My gosh.
- She's good.

386
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,360
- She's a veteran actress.
- This is intenser.

387
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,590
- This is...
- It sounds a lot intenser.

388
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,600
- She didn't even yell.
- She's different.

389
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,200
- I have no hard feelings.
- I know that.

390
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,680
- This is what she sounds like.
- That's heavy.

391
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,180
Today, we are having
One Dollar Gourmet Race.

392
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,150
We prepared
all sorts of delicacies for you.

393
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,890
(They will visit many places
for all sorts of delicacies.)

394
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,790
And everything will be
only one dollar.

395
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,980
- What?
- My gosh.

396
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,080
Everything will be a dollar.

397
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,790
- What?
- My gosh.

398
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,090
And you can earn one dollar
during the race.

399
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,030
Today, Jong Kook, Ji Eun,
and Sae Ho will be the captains.

400
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,590
- Three captains?
- Why me?

401
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,300
We have three kinds of R money
with their faces on them.

402
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,860
- They look cute.
- Why did they do that?

403
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,570
- Sae Ho loves stuff like this.
- It's so cute.

404
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,880
I like it
when people do things with me.

405
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,150
So you will choose a captain
you want for each mission.

406
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,150
I see.

407
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,610
After a mission, you get the money
with your captain's face on it.

408
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,350
The value of the captain's money
goes up with the team's ranking.

409
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,760
It goes up together.

410
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,350
The value of money goes up.

411
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,690
After the money value is decided,
you can exchange your money...

412
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,720
and use it to pay for your meal.

413
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,540
- Each meal has different values.
- I got it.

414
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,910
You can move to another team
in each round considering the value.

415
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,670
- To pick the captain you want.
- I see.

416
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,180
Among the three kinds of R money,

417
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,470
you can choose 20 bills
at the beginning.

418
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,310
Now you can split up
and get the bills you want.

419
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,580
- Okay.
- Okay.

420
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,810
All right.

421
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,290
How would you like
to have your 20 bills?

422
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,190
I'll take Ji Eun's money.

423
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,560
- I'll give you 20 bills of Ji Eun.
- Okay.

424
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,900
I'll try hard anyway.

425
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,960
I'll take ten bills of my money...

426
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,300
and five bills of the other two.

427
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,730
My goodness.

428
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,010
If I do well and win the mission,

429
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,680
the value of my money will go up.

430
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,100
- So...
- Sae Ho, you're talking too much.

431
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,970
(Embarrassed)

432
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,020
- I'm sorry, but I need some time.
- What's taking you so long?

433
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,610
- I'm back after a long time.
- Okay. Go ahead.

434
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,690
It's nice to meet you. I'm...

435
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,450
Will you keep quiet?
I'm doing the shoot here.

436
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,610
I know.

437
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,630
- Why is he being so...
- All right.

438
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,220
Let's go to a secluded spot.

439
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,430
His comments are so lame.

440
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,460
Hey, are you sure you can do this?

441
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,460
I was going
to get your money, but...

442
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,090
Are you sure about this?

443
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,540
I'm sure. I'm feeling good today.

444
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,700
- My gosh.
- Let me make it simple.

445
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,200
Then...

446
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,680
I'll take 10 bills
of Ji Eun's money.

447
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,050
(Ten bills of Ji Eun's money)

448
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,600
And five each.

449
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,180
Ten bills of Ji Eun's money.

450
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,580
Nine bills of Jong Kook's money,
and one bill of Sae Ho's money.

451
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,190
(Ji Eun 10, Jong Kook 9, Sae Ho 1)

452
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,980
Sae Ho money has no value.

453
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,350
I can actually hear it drop.

454
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,080
You can trust me.
I'm feeling good today.

455
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
I'm all-in today.

456
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,850
You are done
choosing your seed money.

457
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,460
- Yes.
- Based on the money you have,

458
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,190
- you can choose a captain you want.
- Shall we?

459
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,440
- We can change teams, right?
- Yes.

460
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,310
One of them might not be chosen
by anyone.

461
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,560
- Yes, that's possible.
- Would that be okay?

462
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,380
- I see.
- That'd be funny too.

463
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,810
- Why would you look at me?
- Really?

464
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,610
If we complete the mission,
the money value will increase.

465
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,710
- We should work together.
- We know nothing about the mission.

466
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,210
- We can make our team strong.
- Okay.

467
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,350
- Shall I say it in front of them?
- Yes.

468
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,580
Really?

469
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,690
- Then let's start with Ssaebssaeb.
- In front of us?

470
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,430
- Can I join the team I want?
- Yes.

471
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,930
- Just as we all want?
- I pick Sae Ho.

472
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,030
- Really?
- Really? You picked Sae Ho?

473
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,270
- That's unexpected.
- All right.

474
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,300
- They're both comedians.
- That's true.

475
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,860
- We're both from SBS as well.
- We...

476
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,060
- Both of them are comedians.
- Right.

477
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,090
- He's my senior comedian.
- Yes.

478
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,510
- Okay. Next.
- I want you to treat me as one.

479
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,560
Ji Hyo, go ahead.

480
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,100
- I pick Sae Ho too.
- Oh, really?

481
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,410
- I'm surprised.
- Gosh, Sae Ho?

482
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,550
- I wonder why.
- Because he's easy to control.

483
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,920
- Oh, is that so?
- Right.

484
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,740
- If you can control the captain...
- If that's not the case...

485
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,580
- I'll pick Sae Ho too.
- Really?

486
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,810
- Are you serious?
- Go ahead.

487
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,350
- I want to join his team.
- Go.

488
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,890
- I pick...
- He...

489
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,260
- I picked him to ruin him.
- It'd be funny if he picks Sae Ho.

490
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,300
Me too. I have the least amount of
Sae Ho's money.

491
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,820
(They joined the team
to decrease the value of his money.)

492
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,460
We can't leave Ji Eun alone.

493
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,640
- I pick Ji Eun.
- I also...

494
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,140
(Suk Jin and Jae Suk chose Ji Eun
without hesitating.)

495
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,730
(If that's the case...)

496
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,810
- Then I'll...
- Haha, join our team.

497
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,180
- Well...
- No pressure.

498
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,380
- I mean...
- Go ahead. It's okay.

499
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,050
Hey, let's start over again.

500
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,680
Starting with me.

501
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,520
- Sae Ho, we...
- Then...

502
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,610
- I said, no pressure.
- I know. It's not like that.

503
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,580
- I'll go with him no matter what.
- No pressure, Minion.

504
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,560
- Hey, make up your mind.
- I already did.

505
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,130
- Which team did you pick?
- I picked Jong Kook.

506
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,190
- I'll make them all dirt broke.
- I picked Jong Kook.

507
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,030
- We're all quite young.
- Right. We're Generation MZ.

508
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,430
- We're Team MZ. Go, Team MZ!
- Team MZ!

509
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,030
- Go, Team MZ!
- Go, Team MZ!

510
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,490
Sae Ho's feelings might change.

511
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,530
- Since they're on the same team...
- Right.

512
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,530
- You never know.
- He might develop feelings for her.

513
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,080
- "How about we have a drink later?"
- That's possible.

514
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,800
Stop it, you all.
I didn't say I wanted that.

515
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,910
- Seriously.
- What are your plans for tonight?

516
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,540
- I have no plans.
- I see. But I have plans.

517
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,820
- I mean...
- Why would you...

518
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,320
- do that to So Min?
- She got rejected by him twice.

519
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,860
- What is wrong with you?
- That's so mean.

520
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,320
- There's nothing wrong with asking.
- Come on.

521
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,190
- You punk.
- But you have plans.

522
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,190
- Why would you do that to So Min?
- I apologize.

523
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,520
Now that you've chosen your teams,

524
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
we'll go to have the first food
after you get changed.

525
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,190
- Okay!
- Okay!

526
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,440
(National Hangeul Museum)

527
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,200
- My gosh.
- Oh, you two are sitting together.

528
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
That's right.

529
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,540
Gosh, So Min. Why are we wearing
matching clothes like a couple?

530
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,270
- This is our team uniform.
- Oh, I see.

531
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,420
- They look like a newlywed couple.
- Right.

532
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,210
I guess
that's how I look from behind.

533
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,120
- That's how I look from behind.
- I can see the resemblance.

534
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,590
Se Chan, why are you sitting there?

535
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,920
- I always sit in the back.
- You two look great together.

536
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,630
- You see, I love romance.
- Yes.

537
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,830
- But you're not curious about them?
- To the point that I'm frustrated.

538
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,430
- I don't think it'll work out.
- I know how that feels.

539
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,190
Hold on. How old are you, Ji Eun?

540
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,340
I'm 30.

541
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,140
- She's Generation MZ.
- She's still young.

542
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,500
- You were born in 1993.
- Yes, I was.

543
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,800
- She was born in 1993.
- I see.

544
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,140
She's still very young.

545
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,270
She was born in 1993?
She's very young.

546
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,540
Ji Eun, do you have a boyfriend?

547
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,000
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

548
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,080
May I ask what type of man you like?

549
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,710
- I care about their personality.
- But...

550
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,690
I care about their personality.

551
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,980
But Ji Eun, listen.

552
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,710
- Don't you care about appearance?
- You see,

553
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,550
- I hate that answer the most.
- unlike what she said,

554
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,100
- when she starts dating someone...
- Exactly.

555
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,190
- Right.
- I bet she'll date a handsome man.

556
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,130
- She'll date a handsome man.
- No.

557
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,870
- What I'm trying to say is...
- Appearance does matter, right?

558
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,960
- that even the flaws he may have...
- Remember Lee Na Young?

559
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,190
- Lee Na Young.
- She said that too...

560
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,460
- but married Won Bin.
- That's right.

561
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,760
- Exactly.
- Ji Eun.

562
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,380
Se Chan has a good personality.

563
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,440
- Indeed. And he's funny.
- Se Chan has a good personality.

564
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,350
I like a funny guy.

565
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,470
And when I start to like his flaws,
I fall for him.

566
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,150
When you start to like his flaws,
you fall for him?

567
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,710
- Yes.
- Do you see his flaws now?

568
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,390
I bet she does.

569
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,980
(Taken aback)

570
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,450
- See? Ji Eun, don't be like this.
- She couldn't answer that.

571
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,360
- Be honest with us.
- You shouldn't be like this.

572
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
- Ji Eun.
- If you don't like me, just say it.

573
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,100
- Wasn't I honest?
- I think...

574
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,170
- Se Chan looks quite charming.
- Indeed.

575
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,170
- He's cute.
- He's moderately good-looking.

576
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,290
- Se Chan is cute, indeed.
- Especially his eyes...

577
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,030
Considering only the appearances
of Sae Ho and me,

578
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,570
- which one of us would you prefer?
- Sae Ho...

579
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,700
(Yang Se Chan versus Cho Sae Ho)

580
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,770
Sae Ho...

581
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,300
- Sae Ho?
- Just be honest.

582
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,850
I think that Se Chan looks better
than Sae Ho.

583
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,650
- She sounds firm.
- Se Chan looks better than Sae Ho.

584
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,540
(Se Chan wins, and Sae Ho loses.)

585
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,620
- She sounds firm.
- I think that it's her way...

586
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,750
- of approaching me.
- She's playing hard to get?

587
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,250
Okay. All right.

588
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,220
- My, he's so optimistic.
- She did that on purpose.

589
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,070
- This is...
- She's trying to get my attention.

590
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,370
- This is the way an ugly man...
- Really?

591
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,190
behaves in front of pretty women
just as So Min said.

592
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,570
- Ji Eun, you're not good at it.
- This is...

593
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,230
She has a long way to go.

594
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,670
- He said she had a long way to go.
- My gosh.

595
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,380
- I like his positive spirit.
- He's handsome.

596
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,910
- You see, I heard...
- He's not handsome.

597
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,650
- that the ladies Sae Ho took...
- I'd say he's cute.

598
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,270
out on dates were all very pretty
although he's not dating them now.

599
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,590
- That's what I heard. Right?
- I heard that too.

600
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,090
- What's your ideal type, Sae Ho?
- He says I'm too small.

601
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,210
- We have never asked him about it.
- True.

602
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,450
- What's your ideal type?
- Exactly. You've never asked.

603
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,930
- We've never asked, right?
- What's your ideal type?

604
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,290
- I'll be honest with you.
- Okay.

605
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,050
- I do like pretty women.
- I see.

606
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,720
- I like pretty women.
- He's very honest.

607
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,640
- You like tall women too, right?
- I prefer pretty women.

608
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
- What about the height?
- Since I'm small,

609
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,140
- Tall women?
- I prefer tall women.

610
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,170
- Then she'd look down at you.
- He likes that.

611
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,700
- That's not a problem.
- Do you like it?

612
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,080
- "That's not a problem."
- "That's not a problem."

613
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,010
I actually had a thing going
with someone who was 178cm tall.

614
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,280
- I met her.
- That was it?

615
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,590
- Didn't you go out with her?
- Was that it?

616
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,190
- I held her hand.
- I see.

617
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,090
- I saw you putting your arm...
- You held her hand?

618
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,630
- around her waist.
- He saw that too.

619
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,830
- Oh, when he spent all his money?
- Yes.

620
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,550
After watching a movie, I wanted
to kiss her on the forehead.

621
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,220
- I went up one step of the stairs.
- Yes.

622
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,100
Then I turned around,
but I was still smaller than her.

623
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,030
That made me feel
a little embarrassed.

624
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,700
- That's a funny story.
- I felt...

625
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,610
- I felt a little embarrassed.
- That was good.

626
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,030
- Good. You're doing great.
- Was it good?

627
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,270
It was good.

628
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,110
Also, I like someone
who's pleasant and cheerful.

629
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,380
So Min is very cheerful and tall.

630
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,920
I'm small and gloomy.
I'm not your type, Sae Ho.

631
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,090
So Min is right.

632
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,250
- That's not true.
- I'm not a cheerful person.

633
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,090
- Ji Eun seems very cheerful.
- Just eat with him.

634
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,390
Yes, I'm quite cheerful.

635
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,750
You're tall too.

636
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,290
- I'm small though.
- How tall are you?

637
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,900
- How tall are you?
- I'm short.

638
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,220
- She doesn't want his attention.
- You're short?

639
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,730
- Yes, I'm short.
- But you seem tall.

640
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,900
- You don't seem short.
- I'm only 165cm tall.

641
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,000
- Oh, you're quite tall.
- You're very tall for me.

642
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,640
- I'm too short.
- You're tall for me.

643
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,440
- I'm too short.
- She's not interested in you.

644
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,580
- You should do better than that.
- That's funny.

645
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,770
- "You should do better than that."
- Right.

646
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,440
By the way, the smell of someone's
cologne is filling up the bus.

647
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,820
It's Sae Ho.

648
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,040
Gosh, seriously.

649
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,650
Oh, great.
This is a barbecue restaurant.

650
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,780
I'm so hungry.
I've been here before.

651
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,510
They serve top-quality Korean beef,
Sae Ho.

652
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,280
- The food is good here, Suk Jin.
- Right?

653
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,100
Oh, my. Something smells good.

654
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,630
- Great.
- Really? You've been here before?

655
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,190
- I don't smell anything.
- I've been here before.

656
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,070
The dishes on the first menu
that will fill your stomach are...

657
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,140
top quality Korean beef
and naengmyeon.

658
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Naengmyeon.

659
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,140
Sounds great.

660
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,440
It looks nice.

661
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,540
(Cool naengmyeon
and fresh, tasty Korean beef)

662
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,010
- Do we have enough money for this?
- Is this okay?

663
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,480
The result of the mission will
determine the prices of the dishes.

664
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,850
So the money we have... I see.

665
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,750
Oh, we need enough money to eat it.

666
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,050
The first mission is
Calculating with a Shaky Hand.

667
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,020
You will use a calculator...

668
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,690
with a low-frequency massager
on one hand...

669
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,990
to answer the given math question.

670
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,030
- We can use a calculator?
- Yes.

671
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,170
- We don't calculate mentally?
- That's right.

672
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,670
Good. So Min, we can do this.

673
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,300
- We'll use our fingers. Right.
- Yes. So we can do this.

674
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,730
The fastest team...

675
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,230
- to get the right answer will win.
- Okay.

676
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,040
- There will be three rounds.
- Got it.

677
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,580
The team captains will go first.

678
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,320
We'll start with Sae Ho and Ji Eun.

679
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

680
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,420
- Okay.
- Go, Ji Eun!

681
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,890
- Let's do this!
- I'll try my best to win.

682
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,050
Sae Ho must be determined to win.

683
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,950
It's just a game,
so I hope you understand me, Ji Eun.

684
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,400
I enjoy using
a low-frequency massager.

685
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,260
That's great. We'll get to eat.

686
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,720
As long as you give me food to eat,
I won't ever leave your team.

687
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,690
- All right.
- I'll stay on this team forever.

688
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,800
- I'm good at games like this.
- You are?

689
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,340
- I'm okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

690
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm good at games like this.

691
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,180
Endure it.

692
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

693
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,880
Ji Eun, let us have some meat.

694
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,210
- I know. I'm hungry.
- Good.

695
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,470
- Ji Eun.
- Let us have some meat.

696
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,090
I really want to eat some meat
and naengmyeon.

697
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,150
Of course.

698
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,040
- I'll make sure we'll eat the food.
- Good.

699
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,050
- Let's eat.
- Oh, gosh.

700
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,830
- It's too intense.
- Hey.

701
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,830
- Is it that intense?
- It makes your arm shake like that?

702
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,660
- It's too intense.
- Ji Eun.

703
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,190
- What is this? It's too intense.
- Ji Eun, remain calm.

704
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,520
Come on, Sae Ho.

705
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,430
- That'd make the game more fun.
- Oh, my. This is fun.

706
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,570
- My gosh. Is it that intense?
- Let's eat some beef.

707
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,960
- Ready. Go.
- Gosh!

708
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,340
(Round One begins.)

709
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,670
- Hold on.
- Ji Eun, start calculating.

710
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,140
- That's a lot of numbers.
- What's that?

711
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,580
My goodness. What's that?

712
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,910
- Let me count. Is it 100,000,000?
- It's difficult.

713
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,510
Should I use only one hand?
Am I allowed to use both hands?

714
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,440
- You can't use both hands.
- Only one hand?

715
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,920
(Falling)

716
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,590
(His hand keeps shaking.)

717
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,480
(His calculator fell off.)

718
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,430
- It doesn't seem easy.
- It seems difficult.

719
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,450
Hold on a second. It's too intense.

720
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,100
- Hey.
- You can't use both hands.

721
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,290
- Only one hand?
- You can use only one hand.

722
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,840
- Oh, no.
- It's 342 million and...

723
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,370
- I can't do it.
- That doesn't look easy.

724
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,300
Gosh. It's too intense.

725
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,530
Hey, Ji Eun.

726
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,570
Hey.

727
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,410
- He's struggling too. Slow down.
- Hey, Ji Eun.

728
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,500
All right.

729
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,910
(Be quiet.)

730
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,080
Ji Eun, get it together.

731
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,580
The last one. Take your time.

732
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,770
My gosh. It's so hard.

733
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,320
- How should I do that?
- It's hard.

734
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,040
- Keep your arm off the table.
- Ji Eun.

735
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,690
Really?

736
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,930
- That makes it even harder.
- How can I do this, then?

737
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,950
Sae Ho, hurry up.
What are you doing?

738
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,660
- That one is Ji Eun's calculator.
- I see. Ji Eun, you're doing great.

739
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
- Ji Eun.
- It's about enduring the pain.

740
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,430
- Oh, my.
- Ji Eun, focus.

741
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,990
How can I do this, then?

742
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,460
- Sae Ho, hurry up.
- Oh, I see.

743
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,870
(Ji Eun starts entering
the 2nd number 1st.)

744
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,730
(Team Ji Eun is doing great
from the beginning.)

745
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,030
- Oh, my.
- Ji Eun, focus.

746
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,380
She's going to win.

747
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,940
Zero, five, two, one...

748
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,700
Zero, five, two, one, one...

749
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,580
- Zero, five, two, one, one...
- Look at Sae Ho.

750
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,440
(Zero, five, two, one)

751
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,820
(Zero, five, two, one, one)

752
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,510
- Zero, five, two, one...
- Look at Sae Ho. He's confused.

753
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,830
- One.
- Sae Ho is confused.

754
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,330
- Minus...
- He's entering a different number.

755
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,450
- Two, eight, one, zero.
- Look at Sae Ho's face.

756
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,830
- Two, eight, one...
- What's with his lips?

757
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,220
- Zero, seven...
- He's really bad at this.

758
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,960
- Sae Ho entered the wrong number.
- Ji Eun, you're doing great.

759
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,200
- Ji Eun, keep going.
- Number nine is missing.

760
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
(He moved on to the 3rd number
without fixing the 2nd number.)

761
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,110
- Two, three...
- Sae Ho entered the wrong number.

762
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,270
- Ji Eun, you're doing great.
- One.

763
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,800
- Am I doing well?
- Ji Eun, keep going.

764
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,580
- She's doing really well.
- Nine, nine, one, zero.

765
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,820
- Nine, nine...
- Sae Ho is so slow.

766
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,010
- My, she's so fast.
- One...

767
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,280
- I think she's...
- Zero.

768
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,390
I didn't put my arm on the table.

769
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,540
- That's not what I meant.
- One, zero, four...

770
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,550
- Ji Eun, keep going.
- I mean...

771
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,820
I think mine is more intense
than hers.

772
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,010
- Ji Eun is doing so well.
- Mine is intense too.

773
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,630
- Four, two, three...
- It seems really hard.

774
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,980
- One.
- You're doing great.

775
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,160
- Sae Ho, you know you can do this.
- Keep going.

776
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,020
- It's 7, 3, 5, 6, 2, 7, 3, 4.
- Overcome it.

777
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,670
- It's 5, 1, 6, 8, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4.
- Oh, no.

778
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,670
Oh, no. What should I do?

779
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,730
- You can do it if you focus.
- One, two, three?

780
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,760
- I think I tapped the wrong button.
- Did you?

781
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,180
Why is that bracket there?

782
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,200
A bracket? Then delete it. Hurry.

783
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,150
- How do I do that?
- Go back and delete it.

784
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,380
How do I go back... Oh, no.

785
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,470
- Okay!
- Gosh.

786
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,470
- Hey, Ji Eun!
- How do I go back... Oh, no.

787
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,690
(She reset her calculator.)

788
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,090
- Hey!
- I'll do it really quickly.

789
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,250
- Three, four, two...
- Sae Ho, hurry up!

790
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,930
- Sae Ho, hurry up!
- Why did you do that?

791
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,100
Are you going to let us
starve to death?

792
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,250
- Eight, four, nine.
- Ji Eun!

793
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,570
Ji Eun, I'll teach you a lesson
if I don't get to eat.

794
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,290
- Come on. Seven, seven, two, zero.
- What should I tap?

795
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,570
Seven, seven, two, zero, three.

796
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,370
Two, eight, one.

797
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,370
- Two, eight, one.
- I'm done.

798
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,030
- Tap the equal button!
- I'm done.

799
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,300
(Meanwhile, Sae Ho is done!)

800
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
I'm done.

801
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,410
- Seven, two, three...
- How do we delete a number?

802
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,970
(Incorrect!)

803
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,770
- Incorrect.
- He got the wrong answer.

804
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,890
- Okay.
- Start over again.

805
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,980
- Darn it.
- Start over again.

806
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,150
- One, zero, four.
- Gosh!

807
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,980
Why is he so bad at calculating
when he's a calculative person?

808
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,050
- Why is it incorrect?
- Minus.

809
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,050
- Take your time.
- One, two, three, one.

810
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,990
- Two...
- Hey, Ji Eun!

811
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,520
- Take your time.
- Ji Eun, tap the "C" button.

812
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,190
Sae Ho is doing it all over again.
So take your time.

813
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,570
- Ji Eun, come on.
- All right.

814
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,190
Two, one. I didn't enter
the wrong number. Oh, dear.

815
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,910
Come on. Ji Eun, keep it together.

816
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,840
- The last one. Take your time.
- Plus.

817
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,110
- Five, five.
- Ji Eun, you've got this!

818
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,380
Sae Ho, divide the numbers
into four sections.

819
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,240
- Ji Eun, you've got this!
- She's almost done.

820
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,040
Eight, two, three.

821
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,110
No, it's 8, 2, 1.

822
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,580
- Eight, two, three.
- Eight, two, one.

823
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,620
- Eight, two, three.
- Four, three, four.

824
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,590
- It's 8, 2...
- It's 8, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4.

825
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,510
- That's good! She's doing well.
- Good.

826
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,550
- You're doing great!
- Ji Eun, we'll get to eat.

827
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,950
- Four.
- Ji Eun!

828
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,950
- Tap the equal button!
- Please get the correct answer.

829
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,720
- Three, four. Equals...
- Tap the equal button.

830
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,190
- The equal button.
- Is this correct?

831
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,450
(She's finally done!)

832
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,520
Tell us.

833
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,170
(Did she get the correct answer
on her second attempt?)

834
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,670
(Incorrect)

835
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,290
- Oh, gosh!
- Oh, no.

836
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,370
- Take your time.
- Start over again.

837
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,410
- Do it again.
- Ji Eun, start over again.

838
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,910
- Okay! Sae Ho, take your time.
- Start over again.

839
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,200
- The first number is wrong.
- He moved on to the next number.

840
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,200
- You're right.
- Three.

841
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,010
- Four.
- Hey, Ji Eun.

842
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,740
- Three, four.
- Seven, seven, two, zero.

843
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,390
- Three, zero, five...
- I'm done.

844
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,550
(Sae Ho is done again!)

845
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,980
- I think he got it right this time.
- Three, zero, five, one, two.

846
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,450
- He got the correct answer.
- Yes!

847
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,660
(Sae Ho got the correct answer.)

848
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,600
- Why don't you guys look happy?
- Hooray!

849
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
- Did you get the right answer?
- Yes, I did.

850
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,900
- Give us food, please.
- Why don't my teammates look happy?

851
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,070
- We're elated.
- What a shame.

852
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,190
(Disappointed)

853
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,200
- Why don't you guys look happy?
- Come on, Ji Eun.

854
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,300
- Please turn this off now.
- Ji Eun.

855
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,640
- Please turn it off.
- Why don't they look happy?

856
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,580
Come on, Ji Eun.

857
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,080
(Screaming)

858
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,850
- No!
- Oh, is it the opposite? Okay.

859
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,740
- All right.
- Ji Eun's reaction was so funny.

860
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,440
I like her reaction.

861
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,360
- I'm sweating.
- That wasn't easy.

862
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,860
- I feel bad. I'm sorry.
- It's so hard.

863
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,630
- By the way, Sae Ho.
- Yes?

864
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,400
- It wasn't professional.
- It was so intense.

865
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,290
- What?
- I can't believe you beat her.

866
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,960
What do you mean,
it wasn't professional?

867
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,260
- Good job.
- Thank you.

868
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,290
What a shame.

869
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,370
I gave her a chance.

870
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,730
- Where are your manners?
- Enjoy your meal.

871
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,570
It didn't hurt so much,
but it kept tingling.

872
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,200
- It keeps tingling.
- Shall we...

873
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,380
- I know how that feels.
- move on to the next round?

874
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,730
You look thinner now.

875
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,150
- Really?
- Yes.

876
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,910
Your face looks sharper now.

877
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,040
Shall we move on to the next round?

878
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
The second round is
Team Ji Eun versus Team Jong Kook.

879
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,010
One player from each team will
play the game.

880
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,890
- How about Seok Sam?
- Okay.

881
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,320
- What do you think?
- Shall I do it?

882
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,660
- Gosh.
- Don't you think...

883
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,050
- we should win this round?
- Yes, Suk Jin?

884
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,720
Let Haha do it.

885
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,750
Okay. Haha will do it.

886
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,050
Okay. Haha will do it.

887
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,460
I think he should go first.

888
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,960
- Only then will I have a chance.
- Okay.

889
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,440
- Haha will do it.
- I like to see them like that.

890
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,840
- Go ahead, Haha.
- Okay.

891
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,260
- Let's do him a favor.
- Jong Kook would say yes...

892
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,030
Maybe I'll win.

893
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,440
Of course. You'll win.

894
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,270
- I must win.
- Right.

895
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,940
- Right. You should win.
- I'll win so that we can eat.

896
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,300
Suk Jin, this feels great.

897
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,850
Jae Suk is enjoying it.

898
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,970
- Does it feel good?
- Yes.

899
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,980
- What is he doing?
- Are you getting therapy right now?

900
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,590
- I'm getting physical therapy.
- Exactly.

901
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,010
It's used for physical therapy.

902
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,890
- Hey, go away.
- I hope he'll win.

903
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,660
- Come on. I'm on your team.
- I know what you'll do.

904
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,360
I know you're going to increase
the intensity all at once.

905
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,100
I won't do that. Come here.

906
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,960
Wait. I'm afraid.

907
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,370
- Come on.
- No.

908
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,290
(Scaredy-cats always scream first.)

909
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,290
(And they overact.)

910
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,870
Gosh. It's no joke.
What's wrong with my arm?

911
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,870
- Increase it gradually.
- He's being a scaredy-cat.

912
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,770
I don't think it's as intense
as it was when I did it.

913
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,580
Gosh, I really hate this.
Hey, don't do that.

914
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,940
- Sit down. I should...
- Don't do that.

915
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,880
It should be the same as Haha's.

916
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,010
(He increases the intensity.)

917
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,940
- Stop it.
- Jae Suk is...

918
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,890
standing there... Jae Suk,
are you playing a game or something?

919
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,010
(Fiddling)

920
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,360
- Jae Suk?
- Increase it gradually.

921
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,450
He looks like a DJ.

922
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,830
- Are you playing a game?
- He looks like a DJ.

923
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,950
(He's enjoying low-frequency DJing
that makes Seok Sam dance.)

924
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,720
Gosh. Stop it.

925
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,670
- Come on, Haha.
- Come on.

926
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,170
- Stop it.
- Hey.

927
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,760
Gosh. I'm not faking it.

928
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,800
- It shouldn't be that intense.
- I'm not faking it.

929
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,370
- It's not that intense.
- Are you serious?

930
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,380
- I'm not faking it, Jae Suk.
- It's not that intense.

931
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,080
Haha, why is your left hand shaking?

932
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,200
- Hey, that's enough.
- I'm not faking it!

933
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,540
The intensity is the same. Look.

934
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,590
Hey, but...

935
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,090
(He's screaming
unnecessarily loudly.)

936
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,550
- What's wrong with him?
- It's the same as yours.

937
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,930
- I'm sure he's faking it.
- All right.

938
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,550
- Hey, how intense...
- Fine. Go back to your seat.

939
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,630
- Go back to your seat.
- Right. Give up.

940
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,830
(Embarrassed)

941
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,170
- There you go.
- I'm sorry.

942
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,370
- This is embarrassing.
- Go.

943
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,640
It was...

944
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,460
- Gosh, seriously.
- It was unbearable.

945
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,170
- Haha gave up.
- He can't play this game.

946
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,460
- He gave up.
- My gosh.

947
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,770
- I felt like I was going to die.
- What's wrong with him?

948
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,540
- Gosh, that scaredy-cat.
- I can't believe him.

949
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,180
Haha is the weakest of all.

950
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,680
- Gosh.
- Hey, Haha.

951
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,180
- He can't...
- Even Ji Eun did it.

952
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,320
Okay. That's just right.

953
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,850
- Are you two ready?
- It should be that intense.

954
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,710
- Hey, go easy on me.
- Keep your arm off the table.

955
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:33,020
- Ready. Go.
- Good. Go, Seok Sam.

956
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,330
- Gosh, this is...
- You must win.

957
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,430
Seok Sam, if you don't win,
we won't get to eat.

958
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,190
- One, four, two, one,
- One at a time. Take your time.

959
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,570
- You can do this.
- nine, four, five, six, seven.

960
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,730
- You must not use the other hand.
- Exactly.

961
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,030
- Jong Kook, don't hold the phone.
- Hey.

962
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,800
- You shouldn't do that.
- I'm not allowed to do that? Okay.

963
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,110
- Come on.
- Plus.

964
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,470
- Plus.
- What's wrong with you?

965
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,940
- Why are you being so sly?
- He entered the wrong number.

966
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,740
- How do I delete a number?
- And 2, 1, 3, 9, 4, 5.

967
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,470
(The digitally illiterate Jong Kook
faced a hurdle already.)

968
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,980
- Two... He's...
- Tap the arrow.

969
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,050
- The delete button.
- This one?

970
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,010
- In the top right corner.
- This one? I see.

971
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,250
- Three.
- Three, nine, four, five? Three.

972
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,790
- Suk Jin's is less intense.
- Two, one, three, nine...

973
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,020
- No, it's the same as Jong Kook's.
- Eight, seven, three, five.

974
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,520
- Gosh, it hurts.
- I'll read it for you.

975
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,930
- It's the same as Jong Kook's.
- Eight, seven, three, five.

976
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,940
- Eight, seven, three, five. Minus.
- Minus.

977
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,140
- One, four, five, six. Minus.
- Gosh, this is hard.

978
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,170
- Am I taking the lead?
- One, four, five, six, three.

979
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,680
- Jae Suk is reading it too.
- It's 1, 4, 5, 6, 3, 9, 8, 2, 7.

980
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,380
(Jong Kook is entering
the right numbers.)

981
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,470
Jong Kook, delete one more number.

982
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,650
- No, delete one more number.
- Behind that number.

983
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,440
- Five, six, three.
- One, four, five, six, three.

984
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,680
- Five, six, three.
- Jong Kook.

985
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
- One, four, five, six, three.
- What?

986
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,350
I said, it was 1, 4, 5, 6, 3.

987
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,210
- Are you sure...
- No, delete it.

988
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,820
- Whom are you talking to?
- Delete it.

989
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,860
- Jong Kook is doing it right.
- That one is mine.

990
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,450
Oh, that one is yours?
I thought it was the other.

991
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,990
- Jong Kook is doing well.
- I was mistaken.

992
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,190
- I thought that one was his.
- What was that?

993
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,050
- What's up with him today?
- I'm sorry.

994
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,190
- What's the matter with you?
- Jong Kook is doing great.

995
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,520
Right. You're doing great.

996
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,670
- Plus... Minus?
- It's perfect.

997
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,260
- Minus?
- Put number 5 between 4 and 6.

998
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,910
- Delete.
- One, four... Oh, it wasn't seven.

999
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,470
- Delete the numbers.
- How do I delete it?

1000
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,300
- Isn't there a button for deleting?
- Don't tap the "C" button.

1001
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,880
- Tap the "C" button!
- The "C" button!

1002
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,470
- Suk Jin, tap the "C" button!
- That's correct.

1003
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,040
- You missed number four. Delete it.
- Eight, five, four.

1004
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,210
- Darn it.
- Three, two...

1005
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,450
- Eight, five, four, three, nine.
- Three, two, five, nine.

1006
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,950
- Four, three, nine.
- Nine. Next.

1007
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,090
- Seven, six, zero, zero, seven.
- Seven, six, zero, zero, seven.

1008
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,160
- Seven, one, nine, nine, four.
- Seven, one, nine, nine, four.

1009
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,020
(Shaking)

1010
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,720
(He can't move his finger
as he wants.)

1011
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,870
- Seven, one, nine, nine, four!
- Minus.

1012
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,300
- Seven, one, nine, nine, four!
- Five, six, four, two.

1013
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,760
- Next.
- Four, four.

1014
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,770
Zero, zero, one, one.

1015
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,380
Four. Plus.

1016
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,790
- Plus.
- One, one.

1017
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,560
- Plus. Gosh, it hurts.
- Three.

1018
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,500
- Is it correct?
- Three, two, five, nine, seven.

1019
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,500
- Correct!
- Jong Kook got the correct answer.

1020
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,360
(Jong Kook got it right.)

1021
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,430
My gosh.

1022
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,840
Darn it. Hey, you try it.

1023
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,700
- Why couldn't you do better?
- Try it.

1024
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,100
- Our team keeps losing.
- I'm worried.

1025
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
You should've played in this round.

1026
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,840
- I should've. I'm the ace.
- Exactly.

1027
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,110
You can't be sure.
You're not the ace.

1028
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,590
- My gosh.
- I'm the ace.

1029
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,790
You would've done a poor job.

1030
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,850
If you can't endure it, go home.

1031
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,490
- What are you doing, Haha?
- Gosh, seriously.

1032
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,790
- So Min.
- What's wrong with him?

1033
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,180
Hey, Haha is doing great.

1034
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,120
- Eight, eight.
- So Min, you made a mistake.

1035
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,090
- Wait.
- So Min, delete the whole thing.

1036
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,660
That's the wrong number.
Eight, eight.

1037
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,860
So Min, delete the whole thing.

1038
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,190
- Haha got the correct answer.
- Yes!

1039
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,300
(Haha got the correct answer.)

1040
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,890
- Hey, I'm impressed.
- He pulled it off.

1041
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,070
- I'm proud of you, Haha.
- I pulled it off.

1042
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,930
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I made it.

1043
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,340
- I'm sorry. We lost.
- It's okay.

1044
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,470
- We lost. What do we do?
- It's okay.

1045
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,070
- I'm sorry.
- You did better than me.

1046
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,620
Each team will receive...

1047
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,640
- How much do we get?
- twenty each.

1048
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
How much is this?

1049
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,010
We'll now reveal the exchange rate.

1050
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,490
See? The money...

1051
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,220
- But...
- Nice.

1052
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,450
The exchange rate is high.

1053
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,450
(Current Exchange Rate)

1054
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,930
- You're right.
- To eat the Korean beef,

1055
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,390
- we need to pay 60 bills.
- Yes, 60.

1056
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,720
With that currency, right?

1057
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,930
If we want to pay
with Ji Eun's notes.

1058
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,100
How much meat will be served?
Not much, I guess.

1059
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,160
The exchange rate
is the worst right now.

1060
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,840
Let's wait until the rate improves.

1061
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,930
The money...

1062
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,300
- Sure.
- Let's not eat for now.

1063
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,680
- Not at all?
- That's right.

1064
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,870
- We should wait for a better time.
- Until the exchange rate improves.

1065
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,050
This is so annoying.
What should I do?

1066
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,070
(He's 5 bills short.)

1067
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,550
- I only have 20.
- Let's do that.

1068
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,120
What about the money
you received before the game?

1069
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,410
I don't want to spend
all of it just yet.

1070
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,350
I should've received Jong Kook's
when I had the chance.

1071
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,600
- We can cash other things in.
- Who wishes to exchange...

1072
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,100
- What's better?
- Se Chan, do you wear a watch?

1073
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,200
Sae Ho, you can exchange
your watch for more money.

1074
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,340
- Do they take watches?
- Luxurious watches,

1075
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,870
- shoes, and...
- I can't believe it.

1076
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,240
- You're right.
- You can cash it in for money.

1077
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,760
And even gold.
I'm glad I accessorized today.

1078
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,370
Why don't we sell a few things?

1079
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,200
Maybe our shoes.

1080
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,550
- Do you take gold?
- Yes.

1081
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,280
We're only being generous
because Ji Eun's our team leader.

1082
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,390
So Min, I'd like to exchange
what I have as well.

1083
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,410
(He visits the exchange counter
when he's practically broke.)

1084
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,220
- A dollar.
- The gold.

1085
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,660
- Just a dollar? Seriously?
- Really?

1086
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,320
Here.

1087
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,700
- These are gold.
- I should at least get 50 dollars.

1088
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,120
(He carefully submits
the brass cutlery.)

1089
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,660
It's 14k gold.

1090
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,370
- It's stainless...
- No, it's gold.

1091
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,470
It's gold.

1092
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,300
- What are you up to?
- I'm selling gold.

1093
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,200
- Gold...
- Hold on a second.

1094
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
- When did you steal these?
- You're selling cutlery?

1095
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,140
- Is it not allowed?
- No.

1096
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,100
Sae Ho...

1097
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,350
How much is Sae Ho's watch worth?

1098
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,200
- A dollar.
- A dollar?

1099
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,180
- Is this worth only a dollar?
- Only a dollar?

1100
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,010
- Everything's worth a dollar.
- Is that so?

1101
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,550
- Come on.
- Really?

1102
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,320
Will I get a dollar
for this 50-dollar bill?

1103
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,780
- A dollar for a 50-dollar bill?
- Seriously?

1104
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,890
(The price is knocked down
in the Running Man universe.)

1105
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:25,950
I'm next.

1106
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,720
(Ji Eun's at the exchange counter.)

1107
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,160
- Just a second.
- I can't believe this.

1108
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,220
Are you buying something?

1109
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,070
- No, I'm selling something.
- I see.

1110
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,870
Here's my smart watch.

1111
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,910
(What she wishes to exchange)

1112
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,970
That's two dollars.

1113
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,530
Three dollars.

1114
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,300
Four dollars.

1115
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,780
(What she wishes to exchange)

1116
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,800
Five dollars.

1117
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,140
She took off all her earrings.

1118
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,140
(She's submitting
all the jewelry she has on.)

1119
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,280
Five dollars.

1120
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,320
We can't take the smart watch.

1121
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,490
I was told that you'd accept it.

1122
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,620
(What fluctuates in price
can't be submitted.)

1123
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,820
Are you sure this is gold?

1124
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,450
Yes, it is.

1125
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,280
They won't take your watch?

1126
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,430
- They won't.
- Why not?

1127
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,300
(Stealthily)

1128
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,720
This is silver.

1129
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,070
It's silver.

1130
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,740
You won't take lip balm, right?

1131
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,890
What else do I have?

1132
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,470
(She even submits
the 50-dollar bill she has.)

1133
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,800
(I'll give you 2 dollars
for everything.)

1134
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,510
- Thank you.
- I can't believe you.

1135
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,240
(With everything she had,
she manages to get 2 dollars.)

1136
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,570
Why did you tell us
not to eat anything beforehand?

1137
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,680
I can't believe these guys.

1138
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,680
- Seriously.
- Jong Seo, here.

1139
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,350
These pants are Calvin Klein.

1140
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,010
Why not when it's a luxury brand?

1141
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,320
(Urgency has him flashing
his chubby tummy.)

1142
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,680
Guys, check this out.

1143
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,320
Isn't Calvin Klein a luxury brand?

1144
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,850
- It is.
- I wanted to exchange it, but...

1145
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,530
It lost its value
when you put it on.

1146
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,530
They wouldn't take it.

1147
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,970
- You showed them that?
- Calvin Klein...

1148
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,740
- Come on, Se Chan.
- I can't believe you showed him.

1149
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,300
- Then I'll...
- Which brand is it?

1150
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,570
- Which brand is it?
- Armani.

1151
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,870
Right, I know that brand.

1152
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,030
Armani.

1153
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,240
Why won't you accept underwear
from luxurious brands?

1154
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,820
I'm also wearing Armani.

1155
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,410
- I'll take this off.
- Armani.

1156
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,950
- They won't take underwear.
- What about this?

1157
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,350
He must've known in advance
to have this much gold.

1158
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,180
- This is real gold though.
- Just so you know,

1159
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,450
you won't get these back
once you have them exchanged.

1160
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,660
You won't get them back.

1161
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,320
- What?
- They won't give them back.

1162
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,890
- Really?
- Viewers will criticize us...

1163
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,120
- for not keeping things real.
- What are you talking about?

1164
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,760
It doesn't make sense
for them to return these.

1165
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,570
You shouldn't return
his gold bracelet.

1166
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,570
(The nail in the coffin)

1167
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,030
- This...
- That made him anxious.

1168
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,010
You can't return his bracelet.

1169
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,100
- You have to be genuine, Sae Ho.
- Hold on.

1170
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,010
Why would I waste
this expensive bracelet here?

1171
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,950
Then don't exchange them for money.

1172
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,320
- Not those you want to keep.
- I'll hand in the bracelet.

1173
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,490
Is a 50-dollar bill
worth a dollar too?

1174
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,090
(Sae Ho exchanges his gold bracelet
for a dollar.)

1175
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,120
- Are you not going to eat?
- No.

1176
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,260
For some reason, I'm not interested.

1177
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,620
(Team Jong Kook that's in 1st place
is the one to save up the money.)

1178
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,550
It's better to save up the money
for later on.

1179
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,160
Director, hold on.

1180
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,220
(Jae Suk visits
the exchange counter.)

1181
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,660
Can I buy the gold bracelet?

1182
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,470
Can I buy it for a dollar?

1183
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,200
Then I'll take it.

1184
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,510
Jae Suk, here. Buy it with this.

1185
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,530
- But that's my money.
- Buy the bracelet.

1186
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,450
(They're hoping to put on
a fun show.)

1187
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,680
- There.
- Thank you.

1188
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,490
- Hey, you can't wear that.
- I bought it.

1189
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,950
- Why would you buy that?
- I bought it.

1190
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,260
I bought it for a dollar.

1191
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,850
Why?

1192
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,050
It was only a dollar.

1193
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,450
Hey, get over here!

1194
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,450
Gosh, sorry about that.

1195
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,700
- Let me help you.
- But I bought it.

1196
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,070
You can't let someone else buy it.

1197
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,660
- But I bought it.
- Good for you.

1198
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,660
- Because...
- Nicely done.

1199
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,530
I'd like to get this
for a dollar as well.

1200
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,430
It's better to buy it
when it's cheap.

1201
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,200
- The exchange rate might go up.
- Sure.

1202
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,300
- Is it Jae Suk's now?
- I bought it for a dollar.

1203
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,700
Do you have any idea
how expensive this is?

1204
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,410
You shouldn't have sold it.

1205
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,910
I'll take it back for a dollar.

1206
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,890
- What?
- I'll sell it for two dollars.

1207
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,280
(The gold is now
double its original price.)

1208
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,890
- Nicely done.
- That's still a bargain though.

1209
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,090
- If not...
- It's still cheap for two dollars.

1210
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,890
I'll sell this for a dollar
and 40 of your bills.

1211
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,260
- Because...
- Hold on.

1212
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,870
Sae Ho's actually worried.

1213
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,240
- But...
- No way, right?

1214
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,870
- He won't give it back.
- I'm not kidding.

1215
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,200
You sold it just now.

1216
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,800
Giving you back the goods
could get us into trouble.

1217
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,100
I'll give you two dollars for it,
then.

1218
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,280
Right now would be preferable.

1219
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,140
I can't believe we have people...

1220
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,600
who are trying to profit
in the middle.

1221
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,820
Why do we have people doing that?

1222
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,850
Everything here
is worth a dollar today.

1223
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,740
- Right.
- And Sae Ho handed in the goods.

1224
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,780
(He hands in a 50-dollar bill
for another dollar.)

1225
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,320
- At a bargain price.
- I made a purchase.

1226
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,350
- I asked if it was possible.
- Good for you.

1227
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,720
- And I was told it was allowed.
- It's so mean.

1228
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,320
Give back my bracelet.

1229
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,890
- Here.
- No way!

1230
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,100
Will I get a dollar
if I sell this again?

1231
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,300
(An exchange where
you spend two dollars to gain one)

1232
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,660
- Don't buy it this time.
- But...

1233
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,430
This is the definition
of creative economy.

1234
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,660
- That's how you earn money.
- Don't just idly sit there.

1235
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,530
- What an investment.
- Exactly.

1236
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,840
I'll buy it again if I can.

1237
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,570
- Then...
- Unbelievable.

1238
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,140
Without doing anything...

1239
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,740
- Naengmyeon.
- A bowl of naengmyeon...

1240
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,010
and two portions of beef.
How's that?

1241
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,590
- How's that?
- I love it.

1242
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,640
Let's have our fill.

1243
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,090
We're having a feast
despite finishing last.

1244
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,490
Exactly. We finished last
in the game.

1245
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,890
Aren't the other teams going to eat?

1246
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,600
- No.
- No, we're going to save up.

1247
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,260
- We don't have the money.
- We'll sit this one out.

1248
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,890
- So Min.
- I'll sell my shoes for money.

1249
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,030
Are we the only ones eating?

1250
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,240
Just us?

1251
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,840
- Hold on.
- Are you selling your shoes?

1252
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,340
- I'll buy those too.
- What?

1253
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,430
These won't fit you though.
Can I sell these?

1254
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,280
- Of course.
- We need to retrieve those shoes.

1255
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,570
I don't have a dollar though.

1256
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,140
Can you lend me 20 bills?

1257
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,740
- The Sae Ho bill?
- Yes.

1258
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,570
I'll exchange 40 of the bills
for a dollar and buy the shoes.

1259
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,280
- I really want those.
- Sure.

1260
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,550
Thanks, So Min.

1261
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,910
- How many do you need?
- Twenty will do.

1262
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,220
Okay, good.
I can buy these back, right?

1263
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,320
(Sae Ho sells his shoes
for a dollar.)

1264
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,320
(There's a reason
he desperately needed the dollar.)

1265
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,120
- There. So Min.
- Go ahead.

1266
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,720
- Have the barbecue.
- Are you sure?

1267
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,100
- Really?
- Go ahead.

1268
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,470
Can I make a purchase?

1269
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,370
- What's with him?
- What about you?

1270
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,930
Go ahead.

1271
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,530
I'm having barbecue
with a friend later today.

1272
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,300
It's like I said. You never know.

1273
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,680
- If he's nice...
- They've never been this close.

1274
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,050
She might change her mind.

1275
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,120
- People slowly grow on you.
- Exactly.

1276
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,010
Ji Eun, what's your take
on men like that?

1277
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,240
They impress me.

1278
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,680
That sounded robotic just now.

1279
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,660
- Ji Eun.
- You're the best!

1280
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,590
- That sounded soulless.
- That's cool of him.

1281
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,820
I'll buy the shoes.
I have 40. It's all there.

1282
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,600
(Se Chan's at the counter
buying the shoes.)

1283
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,700
Thank you.

1284
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,470
These shoes aren't easy
to come by these days.

1285
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,660
I can't believe it.

1286
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,100
I have those too, you know.

1287
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,840
Hold on. Him...

1288
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,010
These shoes aren't easy
to come by these days.

1289
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,240
Can you believe
that I got this for a dollar?

1290
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,300
(Can you believe
that I got this for a dollar?)

1291
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,340
(These shoes
aren't in stock anymore.)

1292
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,640
They fit perfectly!

1293
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,100
How did you pay for it?

1294
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,570
You can get a dollar
for 40 of the Sae Ho bills.

1295
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,050
That can get you these.

1296
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,950
These are for us to keep.

1297
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,550
- Se Chan, pay me back, okay?
- Try those on.

1298
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,820
- Sure thing.
- Why would you lend him the money?

1299
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,050
He badly wanted those shoes.

1300
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,930
- Sae Ho...
- But I sold them for you.

1301
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,220
- Why would you help him out?
- You can't take it back though.

1302
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,030
- He badly wanted the shoes.
- He badly wanted those.

1303
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,030
- He asked in an adorable way.
- They fit like gloves.

1304
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,470
He expressed his wishes.

1305
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,910
They'll look even cooler
if you fold them at the heel.

1306
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,800
- Like this?
- Don't you dare.

1307
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,300
- Don't.
- Okay, my gosh.

1308
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,850
I'll have the Korean beef.

1309
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,370
Forget it. Give it back.

1310
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,070
You can't take back
what you gave me.

1311
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,870
- I'll have the Korean beef.
- The Korean beef?

1312
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,870
The shoes look great on you.

1313
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,850
- Right?
- Please bring in the food.

1314
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,050
- Let's eat.
- Let's do this.

1315
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,820
Check out the naengmyeon.

1316
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,030
This is crazy.

1317
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,490
The marbling is a work of art.

1318
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,050
Here we go. My gosh.

1319
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,490
The beef already looks delicious.

1320
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,470
- This smells like the holidays.
- The marbling is a work of art.

1321
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,930
(He tries a bite.)

1322
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
(So good!)

1323
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,410
It's delicious.

1324
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,510
This is to die for.

1325
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,740
My gosh.

1326
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,240
Have some of the naengmyeon.

1327
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,240
(It was worth selling her jewelry.)

1328
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,090
- Isn't it amazing?
- It is.

1329
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,490
This is incredible.

1330
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,590
- It melts in your mouth.
- This is unbelievable.

1331
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:35,550
- The meat is incredible.
- It looks so good.

1332
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,620
- My gosh.
- Unbelievable.

1333
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,320
Why wouldn't you have this?

1334
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,760
- It's so good.
- You should all have some.

1335
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,890
- I'm not hungry at all.
- As if.

1336
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,570
- He looks starving to me.
- You're not hungry?

1337
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,300
Jong Kook,
you should eat when others do.

1338
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,510
It's just that...

1339
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,870
You know how I am.
I would eat if I was hungry.

1340
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,070
Haha looks hungry to me.

1341
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,070
I'd rather have
something better later.

1342
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,200
- But this is to die for.
- Come on.

1343
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,370
Don't be so calculative.

1344
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,850
One should eat when one's hungry.

1345
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,180
Just eat when you have the chance.

1346
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,490
This is delicious.

1347
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,280
- Try the naengmyeon.
- All right.

1348
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,590
- What do you prefer?
- The spring onions.

1349
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:08,660
- Spring onions?
- Yes.

1350
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,720
I'd like more.

1351
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,990
- This is more than enough.
- I love them a lot.

1352
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,930
(The guilt has So Min
offering a wrap to him.)

1353
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,430
This is incredible.

1354
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,720
Here.

1355
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,370
(Not you)

1356
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,140
Enjoy.

1357
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,840
Enjoy, Se Chan. Is it good?

1358
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:24,700
It's good, isn't it?

1359
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,240
I'm glad...

1360
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,740
there's someone else
that has it worse than I do.

1361
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,970
I'm glad Sae Ho's here.

1362
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,620
Do you not have slippers at least?

1363
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,280
Wear a plastic bag or something.

1364
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,180
- Give me one and I'll wear it.
- Yes. Wear a plastic bag.

1365
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,780
- It happened a lot in the past.
- Yes.

1366
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,260
- Wearing plastic bags.
- Right.

1367
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,890
- It happened a lot in the past?
- Yes.

1368
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,660
- His shoe is cool.
- What's that?

1369
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,620
But isn't it too big?

1370
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,490
Do you not have a small one?

1371
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,930
Are these boots or what?

1372
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,930
Because it's winter.

1373
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,390
- I'll do it.
- Sae Ho...

1374
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,700
- I'll do it.
- Do you think he's trash or what?

1375
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,470
- Give it to me.
- Isn't this a garbage bag?

1376
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,910
Just put Sae Ho in it.

1377
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,780
It's too big.

1378
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,930
Are these long boots?

1379
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,800
(They didn't save the material
when making long boots.)

1380
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,910
Sae Ho has a sense
of fashion indeed.

1381
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:06,910
But...

1382
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,890
It's done.

1383
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,260
- Let's go to the next spot.
- You...

1384
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,850
- The plastic bag is...
- This is warm.

1385
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,350
- That's cool.
- Is it okay?

1386
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:17,350
It looks cool.

1387
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,490
Let's go.

1388
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:19,850
I got no shoes.

1389
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:20,850
(The runway is connected
to the outside.)

1390
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,530
I should just watch out for my feet.
Okay.

1391
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,570
(A fashionista who can pull off
even unusual boots)

1392
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,700
That looks cool.

1393
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,470
You look like Puss in Boots.

1394
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,470
We had meat thanks to Ji Eun.

1395
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,740
We could have it thanks to Ji Eun.

1396
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,340
I'll try to collect more gold.

1397
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,850
- Ji Eun...
- I won't leave Team Ji Eun.

1398
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:38,970
I guess you switched the team.

1399
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,550
- Suk Jin, you too?
- Of course.

1400
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,490
- I guess you switched the team.
- I got to eat meat.

1401
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,680
You switched the team
when we weren't there. Oh, no.

1402
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,050
Look at Ji Eun.

1403
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,050
- Sae Ho.
- Yes.

1404
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:50,660
This is not how you make
people laugh these days.

1405
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
(What?)

1406
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Jae Suk.

1407
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,100
Honey, people make others laugh
with their talk these days.

1408
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,070
- This is not it.
- You wrapped it nicely.

1409
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:00,370
- Why did he take off his shoes?
- What are you doing?

1410
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:03,370
I'm a semi-professional.
Do you think I'd want to do it this way?

1411
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,260
- Sae Ho is working very hard.
- I also want to be funny...

1412
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,280
with my fancy talk.

1413
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,410
- Honey.
- This is not what I intended.

1414
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,680
You should make people laugh
with your talk these days.

1415
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,950
My gosh.

1416
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,220
Why are you sitting there, baby?

1417
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,220
I...

1418
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,970
- He became her baby.
- "Baby."

1419
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,450
He doesn't know what to say.

1420
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,850
- He's perplexed.
- She went for it.

1421
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,180
- It's not like that.
- I should protect you from behind.

1422
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,260
So MIn.

1423
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,720
It's Se Chan who is in your heart.

1424
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,720
- But you're using Sae Ho.
- I know.

1425
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,120
It's a little...

1426
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,720
I sold my shoes for meat.

1427
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,390
You can't give money to Se Chan
for the shoes.

1428
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,410
- What are you doing?
- We're best friends, you know?

1429
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,510
Se Chan, it's amazing
how you got the shoes for a dollar.

1430
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,780
But let me ask you one thing.

1431
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,200
What if he calls me
after the shoot...

1432
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,200
and tells me
to give them back to him?

1433
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,120
- He can't do that.
- It's a little... Right?

1434
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,140
- Because...
- It's a promise with the people.

1435
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,180
That's... Yes.

1436
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,410
- "A promise with the people?"
- It is. You got them for a dollar.

1437
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,160
"A promise with the people."
I like that.

1438
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,550
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

1439
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,450
Ji Eun, don't you have
to get the earrings back?

1440
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:59,660
- She's amazing.
- It's okay.

1441
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,660
- Really?
- Yes.

1442
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,220
I should join Team Ji Eun.

1443
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,320
- She's so nice.
- No, I'm not.

1444
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,260
Of course, she should be nice.
She's on the show.

1445
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,410
- Don't be so mean.
- Suk Jin.

1446
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,160
(He's criticized for being
habitually mean to guests.)

1447
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,340
(Desperately looking away)

1448
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,950
Honestly, you can't judge someone
when you've just met once.

1449
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:19,050
- You don't know.
- That's true.

1450
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,570
- Yes.
- Shut it, you jerk!

1451
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,780
- Why?
- Stop.

1452
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,180
I said you were right.

1453
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,450
That's true, everyone, right?

1454
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,890
- You don't know at first.
- Guys.

1455
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,350
- But let me say this.
- That's true.

1456
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:33,260
Ji Eun is highly likely
to be a nice person.

1457
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,220
- Yes.
- Very likely.

1458
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,390
You're going to see
how fake his life is, Ji Eun.

1459
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,470
- Look at Suk Jin's fake life.
- I'm serious.

1460
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:42,800
- You'll see.
- It's not like that.

1461
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,910
What?

1462
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:46,180
Floss your teeth as you ate meat.

1463
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,070
- Floss?
- Why are you asking her to do it?

1464
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,640
Because she had meat. Just in case.

1465
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,800
- Gosh. Ji Eun.
- I'm fine.

1466
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,620
Flossing on a variety show
is the first time.

1467
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,910
- It's...
- Should I...

1468
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,490
- show it?
- First time on a variety show.

1469
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:58,680
I'll show you
if you're okay with that.

1470
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,680
Yes. It'll be fine.

1471
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,450
(Disturbance warning)

1472
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,680
I can show you.

1473
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,850
You should use floss.

1474
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,160
I use that one too.

1475
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,550
- What?
- It's the same one.

1476
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,260
- I use that one too.
- Why is it not convincing?

1477
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,800
- It's so forced.
- I get easily moved, but...

1478
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,300
If he doesn't like it,
it means he really doesn't like it.

1479
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,410
- Yes.
- Look at this.

1480
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,240
You should use floss like this.

1481
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,930
You said people don't try
to be funny like this these days.

1482
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:21,930
You should be funny with your talk.

1483
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:22,950
- Floss...
- This is subtle.

1484
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:24,740
- Is it floss between his teeth?
- Yes.

1485
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,720
Ji Eun is horrified.

1486
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,450
- Yes.
- Ji Eun...

1487
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,240
It's not the Jae Suk she imagined.

1488
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,280
Floss.

1489
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,550
- It's an interdental toothbrush.
- This is...

1490
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,160
This is very...

1491
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,430
- It hurts.
- Look at him.

1492
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,180
Let me pull it for you.

1493
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,200
(Stubborn teeth that don't let go
of the floss easily.)

1494
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,070
- It's an interdental toothbrush.
- You got an interdental toothbrush.

1495
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,800
It's not teeth special today.

1496
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,160
(Laughing)

1497
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,430
Jae Suk's teeth
are seriously misaligned though.

1498
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,370
They're so misaligned.
How can they be like that?

1499
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,410
So Min.

1500
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,700
That's...

1501
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,780
- Seriously,
- What are you talking about?

1502
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,370
he must've worked so hard
with his teeth.

1503
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:59,970
- They're so misaligned.
- He's a great guy.

1504
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,140
I can still...

1505
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,820
Even if his teeth are misaligned,
it's fine as long as he speaks well.

1506
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,160
- I mean...
- He's good with that.

1507
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,780
You wrapped two people
around your finger.

1508
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,430
How many people
are you going to wrap?

1509
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:14,120
And for Jong Kook,
as the World Cup season started,

1510
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,450
starting from the game
between Uruguay and Korea,

1511
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,620
he has a lot to think about.

1512
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,220
- I do. Right. Thank you.
- So don't mess with him.

1513
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,340
- Right?
- Yes.

1514
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,340
Does he have anything to do with it?

1515
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,640
- He should come up with strategies.
- I should make plans.

1516
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,340
Why does he have to come up
with strategies?

1517
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,180
- I should comment and stuff.
- Yes.

1518
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:29,870
I need to talk about it.

1519
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,100
I know a lot about soccer.

1520
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,220
Suk Jin, what's your prediction
for this World Cup?

1521
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,320
I'll make precise predictions.

1522
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,740
First, we'll win the game
against Uruguay 2 to 1.

1523
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,350
- Why?
- Korea never failed...

1524
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,030
at the first game. Almost never.

1525
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,820
We either won or tied.

1526
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,800
I guess you didn't watch
World Cup Brazil.

1527
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:49,430
What happened at World Cup Brazil?

1528
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,120
What happened at World Cup Brazil?

1529
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,300
(Fake)

1530
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,100
(His fake life
is immediately exposed.)

1531
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,140
This is how you do it.

1532
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,870
- "This is how you do it."
- Did you not watch it back then?

1533
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,280
- Did you not watch the World Cup?
- Do you think I didn't?

1534
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,680
- He just doesn't remember it.
- And...

1535
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,910
we will win against Ghana.

1536
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:05,240
- We will lose against Portugal.
- We'll lose?

1537
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,570
- Then it's 2 wins and 1 loss.
- We'll go to the round of 16.

1538
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,510
At the second restaurant,
I'm going to eat no matter what.

1539
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,050
Let's go to eat.

1540
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,680
My stomach is empty.
I have a sour stomach.

1541
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,930
It feels like they have good food.

1542
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,590
Let's eat.

1543
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,120
(Seafood soup restaurant "H"
in Gangnam)

1544
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:21,950
As expected of Sae Ho.

1545
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,300
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1546
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,260
- Look.
- It looks so delicious.

1547
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:29,700
The dishes we got this time are
raw lobster that melts in your mouth...

1548
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,740
and spicy seafood soup.

1549
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,340
(Meaty raw lobster
and spicy seafood soup)

1550
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,870
Is this one dollar?

1551
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,410
Per one piece.

1552
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,850
One dollar for a bite.

1553
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,470
Is this one dollar as well?

1554
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,620
- I want this.
- This looks delicious.

1555
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,850
I should eat lobster.

1556
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,780
- I can't.
- I should eat lobster at least.

1557
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,490
That's mine.

1558
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,280
- Aren't the shoes pretty?
- They're so pretty.

1559
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,530
- They're perfect for you.
- The shoes...

1560
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:51,350
- suit you.
- The shoes look expensive.

1561
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,720
Where did you put the insoles?

1562
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,850
- I took them out.
- Where are they?

1563
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,100
I paid for them too.

1564
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,120
So where are they?

1565
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,490
I have them. Why?

1566
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,700
- Do you really have them?
- Yes.

1567
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,870
(Threatening)

1568
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:02,470
I should wear them for the shoot.

1569
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,740
- Do you really have them?
- Yes.

1570
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,410
(Threatening)

1571
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:08,570
He's mad.

1572
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,470
I bought them for a dollar earlier.

1573
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,550
Don't make me look weird
in front of many people.

1574
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,820
- But...
- You punk.

1575
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,050
Producer, I got them for a dollar.

1576
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,740
- Right.
- Do I give it back after the shoot?

1577
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,820
- Stop.
- No, you don't have to.

1578
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,680
- It's going to be a problem.
- It isn't how you make them laugh.

1579
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,760
Sorry?

1580
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,220
He said it isn't
how you make people laugh.

1581
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,300
- Sit down.
- Honey.

1582
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,220
- You should talk to be funny.
- I always talked.

1583
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,430
That's not how you make people
laugh these days.

1584
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,600
The audio director told you
to sit down...

1585
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,510
as you keep making
rustling noises. It's loud.

1586
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,600
(The guy in plastic bag boots
is so loud.)

1587
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,600
(Quietly)

1588
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,350
That's cool.

1589
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,740
(The shoes most hated
by the audio director)

1590
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,780
He looks like a hero.

1591
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,910
If anyone wants to switch teams,

1592
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,390
you can go to the team you want.

1593
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,930
- But Ji Eun...
- All of us can be on the same team.

1594
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,450
Ji Eun gave her earrings...

1595
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,600
- for her team.
- Yes. You shouldn't switch.

1596
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,870
My gosh.

1597
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:04,370
Why do you want to come?

1598
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,990
This is crazy.

1599
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,990
What is it?

1600
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,370
(So Min from Team Sae Ho
quietly gets up at that moment.)

1601
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:09,970
- Ji Eun... Then you come here.
- Are you going to that side?

1602
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:10,970
I'll give you my seat.

1603
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,970
- You came here?
- Please sit on the next chair.

1604
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,100
You came here?

1605
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,340
Suk Jin is coming.

1606
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,680
He's coming.

1607
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,550
- Do you want it?
- Yes, we want it.

1608
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,970
This is nice.

1609
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,350
- This is cool.
- Ji Eun. This is for you.

1610
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,720
It's okay. We'll be fine on our own.

1611
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,260
- Did Ji Hyo come here?
- What's happening to Sae Ho?

1612
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,320
- Is Sae Ho alone?
- He's by himself.

1613
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:29,950
- Sae Ho.
- Am I doing it alone?

1614
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,320
(The guy in plastic bag boots
is left alone.)

1615
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,430
Is Sae Ho alone?

1616
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,800
Then I'll go to his side.

1617
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:37,030
Okay. Let's create a balance.

1618
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,300
- We need to be balanced.
- Right.

1619
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,470
- This is how you switched teams.
- Yes.

1620
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:42,600
- Okay.
- I like it.

1621
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,370
Let's have seafood soup.

1622
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,510
- Let's do it.
- Let's cheer up.

1623
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,970
- We can do it.
- I'll make sure to feed you.

1624
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,200
- We can do it.
- I'll sell something.

1625
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,740
The mission for this round
is Water Splash in Silence.

1626
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,640
Each team will play Cry in Silence.

1627
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,550
Whenever you get the question right,
you can remove a stick...

1628
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,990
from the water bomb hat
the leaders of other teams are wearing.

1629
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:07,350
The game ends when you make
water bombs...

1630
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,120
- for both leaders explode.
- Okay.

1631
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,820
(They should make all water bombs
explode to succeed.)

1632
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,140
Three teams will try it and will be
ranked based on the time they take.

1633
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,470
Who is going to try first?

1634
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,470
- We'll go second.
- Okay. Then Team Jong Kook first.

1635
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:20,740
- Okay.
- We first?

1636
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,870
(Team Jong Kook will try first.)

1637
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,240
Gosh, this is complicated.

1638
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,470
Oh, my, it's loud.

1639
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,970
(Two teammates are wearing headsets
to play Cry in Silence.)

1640
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,280
- I hear nothing.
- I really can't hear.

1641
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,350
- Can you not hear?
- It might explode at once.

1642
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,410
- Can you not hear?
- No, I can't.

1643
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,660
- Se Chan, scream.
- Okay.

1644
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,010
Scream.

1645
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,990
(Shouting)

1646
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:38,030
- You got so many gold teeth.
- Yes.

1647
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,300
- I should sell them.
- Get ready. Hey.

1648
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,720
- Where should I look? That one?
- Hey.

1649
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,430
- Okay.
- Get ready. Go.

1650
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,740
- Go.
- Get ready. Go.

1651
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:47,930
(MBTI)

1652
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:51,140
(Jong Kook has to explain
what MBTI is.)

1653
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:58,350
It's a personality test.

1654
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:59,640
A quote from the Bible?

1655
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,970
A test.

1656
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,590
- A quote from the Bible?
- This is hard.

1657
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,010
A personality test.

1658
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,450
- A quote from the Bible?
- A test.

1659
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:08,950
- "Sa."
- He can't hear anything.

1660
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:10,350
- This is impossible.
- A quote from the Bible?

1661
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,850
A personality test.

1662
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,850
Seoul sightseeing?

1663
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,120
This won't do. His eyes lost focus.

1664
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,840
(His eyes lost focus.)

1665
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,530
- Come out. Let's switch.
- We should switch.

1666
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:22,930
- Switch.
- Switch?

1667
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:23,930
You go in.

1668
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,140
- This takes time.
- Yes.

1669
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,100
(Urology)

1670
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,600
Kkwachu.

1671
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,640
Gwangju?

1672
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,300
- Kkwachu Hyung.
- Gwangju Station?

1673
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,300
(Urology)

1674
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,620
Hospital.

1675
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,410
- Hospital? One in Gwangju?
- Brother Kkwachu.

1676
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,780
There are many hospitals in Gwangju.

1677
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,890
Samsung Hospital?

1678
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,910
- No.
- Severance Hospital.

1679
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:41,990
- What?
- Severance Hospital.

1680
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:44,050
- "Severance Hospital."
- Which department?

1681
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,490
Which department?

1682
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,820
- You visit the department often.
- Which department?

1683
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,800
Cardiothoracic surgery.

1684
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,220
- What?
- Cardiothoracic surgery.

1685
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,430
- Think of Jae Suk.
- Urology.

1686
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:52,490
(Correct)

1687
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,100
- Correct.
- It was...

1688
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,990
- He did well.
- Let's go.

1689
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,700
- Thank goodness.
- I got goosebumps.

1690
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,140
- Ji Eun survived too.
- What are the odds?

1691
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,200
This is incredible.

1692
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,070
Cho Sae Ho!

1693
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,700
- Cho Sae Ho!
- Cho Sae Ho?

1694
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,910
Cho Sae Ho!

1695
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,550
- Cho Sae Ho!
- Cho Sae Ho?

1696
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,390
He gained weight.

1697
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,410
No. Losing weight...

1698
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:15,510
- and gaining it back.
- I know.

1699
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:18,820
Shoulders. Narrow shoulders.

1700
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:21,530
Losing weight and gaining it back.

1701
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:23,160
(Annoyed)

1702
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,640
- Bloated. His face is bloated.
- No.

1703
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,200
He was like this
after losing weight.

1704
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,840
- He lost weight and gained it back.
- He gained it back.

1705
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:34,680
- Right now...
- The yo-yo effect.

1706
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,700
(The yo-yo effect is correct.)

1707
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,800
- The last one.
- Okay.

1708
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,240
- Correct.
- Let's do this.

1709
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,120
- Why isn't it coming out?
- It isn't coming out.

1710
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,240
- The last one.
- Okay.

1711
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,620
- Correct.
- Let's do this.

1712
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,160
(Ji Eun survived again.)

1713
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,550
- Good.
- It isn't coming out.

1714
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,720
This is incredible.

1715
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,720
- Cho Sae Ho.
- What are the odds?

1716
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,720
- Cho Sae Ho.
- Cho Sae Ho.

1717
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,720
- Name.
- Cabbage.

1718
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,030
- Yes.
- Okay.

1719
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,030
(They continue to get
correct answers.)

1720
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,370
- Ji Eun.
- It isn't coming out.

1721
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,490
- What's going on?
- It isn't coming out.

1722
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:59,530
- This makes no sense.
- Hurry up.

1723
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,390
- Clogged toilet.
- What do you use then?

1724
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,700
Plunger.

1725
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,700
- Yes.
- All right.

1726
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,700
They are good.

1727
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,700
It's a 50-50 chance.

1728
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:07,680
This makes no sense.

1729
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,780
- Botox injection.
- Why do you get it?

1730
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,470
Wrinkles.

1731
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:13,280
- All right.
- The water needs to come out now.

1732
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,780
(Haha finally removes
the last stick.)

1733
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:17,090
- It's coming out.
- No.

1734
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:18,350
It's finally coming out.

1735
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:21,350
- It's coming out.
- All right.

1736
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,030
- It's coming out.
- It's coming out.

1737
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:24,350
What was the five-letter word?

1738
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,620
The last stick did the trick.

1739
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,350
- The water came out.
- It came out.

1740
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,030
How did it hold out until the end?

1741
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:30,120
It finally came out.

1742
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,870
Until the end... I bet we won.

1743
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:34,640
- The water trickled down.
- Seriously.

1744
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,100
- Do we give the questions?
- We need to answer them too.

1745
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,240
Ji Eun, will you guess?

1746
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,410
I will guess the words.

1747
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,100
- Get ready.
- What are we going to do?

1748
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,410
- Can you do well?
- I will pick the sticks well.

1749
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,600
- Set, go.
- They can't hear me.

1750
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,970
(Blind date)

1751
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,320
- A man...
- A man...

1752
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,350
- and a woman...
- and a woman...

1753
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,120
- meet.
- meet.

1754
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,120
Lovers?

1755
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,350
The first meeting.

1756
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,720
What?

1757
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,600
- The first meeting.
- Things are getting complicated.

1758
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,620
Marriage interview?

1759
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,530
- The first.
- Marriage interview.

1760
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,120
My goodness.

1761
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,470
A man and a woman meet.

1762
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,340
- It's an easy one.
- The first.

1763
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,930
- Installment savings?
- The first.

1764
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,680
- Marriage?
- My goodness.

1765
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,340
- I don't know what to do.
- She can't hear Ji Hyo.

1766
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,680
She can't hear Ji Hyo.

1767
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,600
- It seems that way.
- I don't know what to do.

1768
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,620
She can't hear Ji Hyo.

1769
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:22,410
- A man and a woman.
- A man and a woman.

1770
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,950
"Hello."

1771
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:25,680
Be still.

1772
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,820
- What?
- You can't act it out.

1773
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,320
- It's prohibited.
- Keep your hands behind you.

1774
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,090
- Be still.
- What?

1775
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:31,950
- This is too much.
- Hello.

1776
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:33,100
Hello.

1777
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,160
(Bowing)

1778
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,720
- You can't act it out.
- Hello.

1779
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,430
- Marriage interview?
- Hello.

1780
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,100
- You can't act it out.
- Seriously.

1781
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,700
(Ji Hyo can't hear him.)

1782
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

1783
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,340
I am Song Ji Hyo.

1784
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,430
Installment savings.

1785
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,700
She keeps saying,

1786
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,200
- "Installment savings."
- I am Song Ji Hyo.

1787
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,200
This is funny.
This is how you play the game.

1788
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,220
Just now...

1789
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,620
- No.
- Pass.

1790
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,720
- Ji Eun is so funny. "Just now..."
- It was an easy one.

1791
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,950
- Pass.
- Pass. I can't hear anything.

1792
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,720
It was an easy one.

1793
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,030
- Someone...
- This is hard.

1794
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,550
- who made a lot of money.
- Oh, no.

1795
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,350
Someone who made a lot of money.

1796
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,800
Someone who suddenly made
a lot of money.

1797

1798
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:13,100
- An heir.
- Think of another name.

1799
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,340
- Carrot?
- Think of another name.

1800
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,410
(Nouveau riche)

1801
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,700
(She heard "Carrot.")

1802
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,300
- Carrot?
- This is funny.

1803
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,280
- Secondhand market?
- This is funny.

1804
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,510
- Carrot? Secondhand market?
- This is funny.

1805
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,240
- This is funny. Good.
- Secondhand market?

1806
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,570
That's right.

1807
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:31,990
- No.
- It's incorrect.

1808
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,620

1809
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,090
- This is great.
- You are good.

1810
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:36,260
This is great. Ji Eun is good.

1812
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,530
- This is great.
- You are good.

1813
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,120

- a lot of money.
- Yes.

1819
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,660
Someone who made a lot of money.

1820
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,600
- "Suddenly" is the key.
- This person uses it frivolously.

1821
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,410
- Stocks.
- A wealthy person.

1822
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,910
Think of another name.
"Suddenly" is the key.

1823
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:57,970
- Suddenly.
- Grandma?

1824
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,050
- Suddenly!
- Suddenly.

1825
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,510
- Extremely rich.
- "Extremely rich."

1826
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:03,680
- You are getting there.
- Filthy rich.

1827
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,990
- Extremely rich.
- Don't give her clues. Stay still.

1828
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,510
- Sit down.
- This person suddenly became rich.

1829
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,680
- This person suddenly became rich.
- What's the word for it?

1830
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,990
Lottery.

1831
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,700
- This person suddenly became rich.
- Lottery.

1832
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,220
- Totally rich. Totally.
- Lottery.

1833
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,320
Lottery.

1834
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,390
Totally rich?

1835
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,530
"Totally rich."

1836
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,030
(She got fooled once again.)

1837
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,510
(She is like a human sponge
who soaks in all information.)

1838
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:28,870
- Suddenly!
- You are doing great, Ji Eun.

1839
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,300
- Lottery.
- I don't know.

1840
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,950
- Don't you know?
- Pass.

1841
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,510
- Lottery.
- Someone...

1842
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:34,970
- Pass.
- who suddenly made a lot of money.

1843
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,620
She said, "Totally rich."

1844
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,220
- We had it...
- We had it...

1845
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,910
- in the morning.
- in the morning.

1846
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,910
- Jae Suk...
- Beef.

1847
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,030
- Okay. Beef.
- Jae Suk...

1848
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,950
sent us this.

1849
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,050
Coffee truck.

1850
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,320
(Coffee truck)

1851
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,720
Take out a stick.

1852
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,030
Shall I take out this one?

1853
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,140
It isn't spilling.

1854
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,140
(Both of them survived.)

1855
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,370
- It will take some time.
- All right.

1856
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,410
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday.

1857
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,410
(Qatar)

1858
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:05,600
The World Cup.

1859
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,780
The...

1860
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,120
The World Cup!

1861
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,010
W...

1862
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,410
- The World Cup.
- W...

1863
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,680
- The World Cup.
- The World Cup.

1864
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,680
- This time, where does it happen?
- This time.

59:59,699 --> 01:00:00,969
Uruguay.

1865
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:18,220
(Uruguay?)

1866
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:19,720
Uruguay.

1867
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,320
(The hosting country
of the World Cup suddenly changed.)

1868
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,620
- She is good.
- Seriously.

1869
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,220
- There you go.
- Ji Eun is good at this.

1870
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,340
There you go.

1871
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,660
- She is good.
- Ji Eun is good at this.

1872
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,970
Which country?

1873
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:32,870
The host. The hosting country.

1874
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,510
- Home.
- What's the hosting country?

1875
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,240
- The hosting country.
- The hosting country.

1876
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,700
- The hosting country!
- Home.

1877
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,720
- The hosting country.
- The World Cup hosting country?

1878
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,910
- The World Cup hosting country.
- How did she get that?

1879
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:47,990
(The human sponge
succeeded in making out the words!)

1880
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:50,260
The country that is hosting
the current World Cup?

1881
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,490
- That's right.
- Which country is it?

1882
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:54,030
Which country is hosting it?

1883
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:55,260
(Which country is hosting it?)

1884
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:57,530
My goodness.

1885
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,100
(The sponge girl's basic question)

1886
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,890
- She is good. Ji Eun is good.
- She is good.

1887
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,300
- She is good.
- Ji Eun is good.

1888
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,070
- She is the best.
- I don't know. Five syllables.

1889
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,410
- Okay.
- It doesn't have five syllables.

1890
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,070
Two syllables.

1891
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,100
- Okay. Pass.
- Pass.

1892
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,470
(Hotteok)

1893
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:16,120
- Busan.
- This is hard.

1894
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,680
- Seagulls.
- In Busan,

1895
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,990
- this is famous.
- Vacation.

1896
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:20,590
- Famous.
- It's a snack.

1897
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,850
- Gelato.
- What?

1898
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,950
Is gelato famous in Busan?

1899
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,030
- I want to see her have a quiz.
- I was there yesterday,

1900
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,530
- but I had no idea.
- Ji Eun is good.

1901
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:31,120
Yes, she is. She is funny.

1902
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,620
Snack.

1903
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,840
Famous.

1904
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,600
A light snack.

1905
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,070
- A light snack.
- Yes.

1906
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,700
- Where?
- Busan.

1907
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,200
Busan. Hotteok.

1908
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,200
There you go!

1909
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,240
(A light snack in Busan: Hotteok)

1910
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,240
- She did well.
- Is it famous in Busan?

1911
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,570
This isn't it either.

1912
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,910
- So Min, why are you so bad at it?
- This is bad. I don't know.

1913
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:50,090
- This must be it.
- She is slow-witted.

1914
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:51,350
- Her wits...
- Gosh.

1915
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,820
- It's coming out.
- Is it coming out?

1916
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,990
Why is there so much water?

1917
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,720
Mine didn't burst. Okay.

1918
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,990
All right.

1919
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,720
- Stomach.
- Us.

1920
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,620
Stomach.

1921
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,320
- Us.
- Stomach.

1922
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,100
- Us.
- In our bodies...

1923
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,740
- In our bodies...
- Stomach.

1924
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,970
- Stomach.
- Stomach.

1925
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,390
- Stomach.
- She should say, "Medical checkup."

1926
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:11,200
- Not that one.
- Liver.

1927
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,570
- No.
- Intestine.

1928
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:13,680
- Go on.
- Medical checkup.

1929
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,910
- Medical checkup.
- Large intestine.

1930
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:16,600
- There you go.
- Small intestine?

1931
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,410
- You look at the inside.
- Legs?

1932
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:22,050
Stomach. Liver. Heart?

1933
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:23,910
- Go down further.
- Come on.

1934
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:25,090
Go down further.

1935
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,590
- Medical checkup.
- Hospital.

1936
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:27,590
Hospital.

1937
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:29,180
Internal medicine.

1938
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,620
- Time's up.
- Okay.

1939
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,430
Okay.

1940
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,430
- Second place.
- Ji Eun, it was funny.

1941
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,490
- It was so funny.
- I am sorry.

1942
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:40,740
Plucking out leg hairs.
I got it done.

1943
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,100
- I got it done.
- Waxing.

1944
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:44,870
Waxing.

1945
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,010
Jae Suk heard him.

1946
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:47,970
- It's coming out.
- It's coming out.

1947
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:49,030
- Okay.
- It's coming out.

1948
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:50,680
- I need to dance.
- No.

1949
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,240
(Twerking)

1950
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,870
- Dance.
- You can't dance.

1951
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:57,120
- Twerking.
- Okay.

1952
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,320
- Is it coming out?
- Is it coming out?

1953
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,590
- It's coming out.
- Okay.

1954
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,260
(They speedily set off
Ji Eun's bomb too.)

1955
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,890
- Okay.
- We are fast.

1956
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:03,930
We are done.

1957
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,530
- This is hard.
- I will announce the results.

1958
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:09,430
Team Sae Ho took first place.

1959
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:10,430
Good.

1960
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:12,100
Team Jong Kook took second place.

1961
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,740
- Team Ji Eun took third place.
- I didn't set off the bombs fast.

1962
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,300
- Okay.
- You did well.

1963
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,930
We are getting a lot this time.

1964
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,340
Only the exchange rate is different.

1965
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,300
Thirty bills.

1966
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:22,410
All right. Okay.

1967
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:27,820
(Depending on the ranking,
the exchange rate is different.)

1968
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,620
Forty bills for a dollar.

1969
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:30,620
For the 2nd place,
it's 50 bills for a dollar.

1970
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,820
We can eat one dish, right?

1971
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,260
Shall I eat the seafood soup
or lobster?

1972
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,910
What happened?
Is the exchange rate out?

1973
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,490
I want the seafood soup.

1974
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,030
Do you want to change it
with Jong Kook's money?

1975
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,820
- Ten bills of Jong Kook's money.
- Really?

1976
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,390
- How many bills?
- Ten bills.

1977
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,070
Why don't we exchange them?

1978
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:47,260
Ten bills? Okay.

1979
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,990
Hold on. Let me check.

1980
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:51,260
- I won't change teams now.
- Really?

1981
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,660
Who do I pay if I want to eat?

1982
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,140
- Sae Ho.
- Yes?

1983
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,680
Would you lend me six bills?

1984
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,950
Well...

1985
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,950
- Your money.
- I am sorry.

1986
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,780
Don't say that.
I need 40 bills to eat.

1987
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:03,850
Right.

1988
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:05,950
Lend me six bills.

1989
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,890
(Sae Ho pretends not to hear him.)

1990
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,260
- Sae Ho, I need to eat.
- I don't have 50 bills.

1991
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,050
- I think...
- Sell something.

1992
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:13,700
- you should sell something.
- I...

1993
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,220
I have five bills of Sae Ho's money.

1994
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,720
Who wants to exchange them
for five bills of Jong Kook's money?

1995
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,120
- I will do it.
- Really?

1996
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,490
- Yes.
- Can you do that?

1997
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:21,470
- Three, four, five.
- It's worth more,

1998
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:22,930
- but I will give you a flat rate.
- Okay.

1999
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,100
- You know what I mean.
- Thank you.

2000
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,510
It looks like you are selling
gift certificates.

2001
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:26,640
Something like that.

2002
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:30,410
Other team members can switch teams,
but captains can't do that.

2003
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,470
So I should collect my money only.

2004
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,550
I am selling designer shoes
for two dollars.

2005
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:38,620
I will give you two bills
of Ji Eun's money.

2006
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,410
That doesn't sound very appealing.

2007
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,590
I have five bills of Ji Eun's money.

2008
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,660
Who wants to exchange
five bills of Jong Kook's money?

2009
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,100
- Does anyone need Ji Eun's money?
- Forty bills.

2010
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,850
- No?
- Five bills of Ji Eun's money...

2011
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:50,320
for five bills of Jong Kook's money.

2012
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,530
Ten bills of Ji Eun's money.

2013
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,800
- Ji Eun's money for Jong Kook's.
- Two bills of Ji Eun's money.

2014
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,840
- Why is everyone getting rid of it?
- Two bills of Ji Eun's money.

2015
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:58,970
Things are quite active
at the over-the-counter market.

2016
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,070
- Things are quite active.
- Things are quite active.

2017
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:03,740
The exchange rate is the worst
for Ji Eun's money.

2018
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,850
- I will win the next time.
- Okay.

2019
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,850
There is too much Ji Eun's money
going around.

2020
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,680
- You know,
- Right now...

2021
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,850
Ji Eun's money became so cheap.

2022
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:15,490
There is too much of Ji Eun's money
going around right now.

2023
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,050
Here are 40 bills of Sae Ho's money.

2024
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,100
Exchanging 5 bills of Ji Eun's money
for 5 bills of Jong Kook's money.

2025
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,160
- Here you go.
- You jerk.

2026
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,530
(Haha exchanged 50 bills
of Jong Kook's money for 1 dollar.)

2027
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,030
- I need to eat this time.
- Will you eat?

2028
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,930
- Yes.
- Does seafood soup come with rice?

2029
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,700
I will eat the next time.

2030
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,030
I am not hungry.

2031
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,200
(Jong Kook decides to eat
the next time.)

2032
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,850
I don't need this. Can I rip it up?

2033
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,470
I will give you one.

2034
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,240
- Five for one.
- I will blow my nose...

2035
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,870
- with Sae Ho's money.
- One.

2036
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:45,890
- All right.
- Five bills of Sae Ho's money.

2037
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,280
I am going to rip it up.

2038
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:48,550
- Hey.
- I am going to rip it up.

2039
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:50,120
I am going to blow my nose.

2040
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,430
If you don't give me one,
I will rip it up.

2041
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:52,780
- Cherish it.
- I will rip it up.

2042
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,850
- Why would I give you one?
- Give me one.

2043
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,660
- Rip it up.
- I will rip it up.

2044
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,800
(Se Chan threatens to rip up
Sae Ho's money.)

2045
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,100
Ji Eun, are you going to eat
something?

2046
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,070
- You can't, right?
- I need to save up money.

2047
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,840
- I don't think we can eat.
- I learned something today.

2048
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,280
I will go all in Ji Eun's money
in the next round.

2049
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,340
- Same here.
- I have a lot of Ji Eun's bills.

2050
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,350
That's a good idea.

2051
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,470
We will bring in the food now.

2052
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,740
- Gosh, look at this.
- This is nice.

2053
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,240
This is nice.

2054
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,280
- We will eat now.
- Look at this.

2055
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,720
- It isn't half bad.
- This is incredible.

2056
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:21,990
- So Min.
- Can we eat?

2057
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:23,590
- Okay. Have a piece.
- It's tasty, right?

2058
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:26,160
It's so tasty.

2059
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,320
Luckily,

2060
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:30,300
I have been eating all the dishes.

2061
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:31,760
Two more rounds remain, right?

2062
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:35,070
I am very hungry.

2063
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:37,570
Can I sell my silver ring
for a discount?

2064
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,870
Aren't our jewelry enough
for a dish?

2065
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,600
(They try to negotiate
with their silver jewelry.)

2066
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,930
It looks tasty.

2067
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:44,870
If everything fails,

2068
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,850
- I will sell these shoes.
- You should sell them.

2069
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,620
- You have that option.
- I am torn.

2070
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,140
I don't know if I should sell them
here or on Carrot Market.

2071
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,350
- Sell them on Carrot, of course.
- Five bills of Sae Ho's money.

2072
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,050
- What?
- For lobster sashimi.

2073
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,280
How big is a bite?

2074
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,180
- Really?
- Five bills of Sae Ho's money.

2075
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,530
- I only have three bills.
- Okay.

2076
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,930
- Sell it for five Ji Eun bills.
- Thank you.

2077
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,200
Give me a thick piece with sauce.

2078
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:06,990
- It's thick.
- Give me a thick piece.

2079
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,470
- Give me a piece of sashimi.
- Rip it.

2080
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:11,470
- How many bills?
- Three bills of Sae Ho's money.

2081
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,570
(Ji Eun purchases a bite
because she is hungry.)

2082
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:14,640
It's tasty, right?

2083
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,200
It's tasty, right?

2084
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,970
It's like shrimp sashimi.

2085
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,780
Who wants the lobster shell
for decoration?

2086
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:21,350
It's five bills of Sae Ho's money.

2087
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:22,370
One bill of Sae Ho's money.

2088
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:23,590
One bill? It's a deal.

2089
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,280
Give me the bill and take this.

2090
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,990
Okay. I will put it
on top of the shoes.

2091
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:28,450
- Hey.
- Why?

2092
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:30,720
- Why would you do that?
- I want to put the lobster shell...

2093
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,680
- on these designer shoes.
- It will look cool.

2094
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,890
- Right?
- It will look cool.

2095
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:37,720
- I collected a lot of money.
- Let's go to the next location.

2096
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,100
- Okay.
- Okay.

2097
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,760
Let's refresh ourselves. Okay.

2098
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,530
What do they sell here?

2099
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:45,660
(The last place of the day)

2100
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,410
- I feel bad for Jong Kook.
- This is the food.

2101
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:48,640
Jong Kook hasn't eaten anything,

2102
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,200
- but this place has dessert.
- It's dessert.

2103
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,510
I haven't eaten anything.

2104
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,470
- It looks tasty.
- It looks tasty.

2105
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:54,950
I want something sweet.

2106
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,350
- What kind of food is there?
- It looks so tasty.

2107
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:57,990
Coffee.

2108
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,510
- Is it a bowl of rice?
- I...

2109
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,660
What?

2110
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,720
Isn't it a bowl of rice?

2111
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,720
(Se Chan mistakes a cake
for a bowl of rice.)

2112
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,350
For goodness' sake. My goodness.

2113
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:07,260
- What am I going to do?
- Team Ji Eun.

2114
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,220
- I want a meal.
- I starved all day.

2115
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,700
but we came to a dessert place.

2116
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,140
This is a day for me.

2117
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,140
- I will stick with Jong Kook.
- I'm all in.

2118
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,300
We need to place first.

2119
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:20,280
- I need to join Team Ji Eun.
- Same here.

2120
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:21,840
- Come.
- I only have Ji Eun's money.

2121
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,970
- I will win this time.
- Everyone has a path to take.

2122
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,180
Ji Eun, please win this time.

2123
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,320
- Okay. I only have my money too.
- I will go all in.

2124
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,240
So Min, aren't you going to come?

2125
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,280
- I am going to stay here.
- Trust me.

2126
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,110
So no one is joining Team Sae Ho.

2127
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,410
- Sae Ho is alone.
- Really?

2128
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,950
- Sae Ho's money is worthless.
- I am sorry.

2129
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,280
- I am sorry.
- This is no way to treat a guest.

2130
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,320
I visited after a long while
and got my shoes taken away.

2131
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,760
It can't be helped.

2132
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:45,190
I only have Ji Eun's money.
I can't join any other teams.

2133
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:46,990
I have 65 bills of Ji Eun's money.

2134
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,530
You have a lot of bills.

2135
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:51,660
The last menu is the finale
of every gourmet experience,

2136
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,140
- the sweet dessert.
- Okay.

2137
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,110
Is this the last round?
Is there one more round?

2138
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:58,740
After this one,
there will be a round for a prize.

2139
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,720
- Really?
- That will be the last round.

2140
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,680
This is the last round with food.

2141
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,910
Se Chan and Jong Kook
haven't had any food.

2142
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,110
Se Chan thought the dessert
was a bowl of rice.

2143
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,760
- I thought it was rice.
- The last round.

2144
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,480
- How did you see it as rice?
- Rice.

2145
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,230
- It looks like rice.
- It does look like rice.

2146
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:13,860
That's how rice looks
before making rice balls,

2147
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,430
He must be so hungry.

2148
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,800
This mission is...

2149
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,120
- the Scary Slipper.
- The Scary Slipper.

2150
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,490
Two members of other teams will sit on
both sides of the player.

2151
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,160
- The player will get 20 chances...
- Okay.

2152
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:30,570
to attack the member's shin
with the palm of his or her hand.

2153
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:32,510
If the attack is successful,
the player gets one point.

2154
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:33,650
You use the slipper.

2155
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:35,570
- The game is Haha's idea.
- Haha.

2156
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:37,850
- Haha brings many such games.
- He does.

2157
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,690
Haha loves Running Man a lot.

2158
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:41,060
He is an idea bank.

2159
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,690
The team with many members...

2160
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:44,320
- can switch out the player.
- Okay.

2161
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,590
The rankings will be decided
by the earned points.

2162
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:47,900
Let's win this time.

2163
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,820
But I am alone.

2164
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,660
You need to keep playing alone.

2165
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,160
I need to keep playing alone.

2166
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,400
I don't know if I am imagining it,

2167
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,140
- but someone's feet stink.
- Whose feet stink?

2168
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,510
The smell isn't coming from my feet
because they are wrapped up.

2169
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:01,770
Right?

2170
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,230
Whose feet stink?

2171
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:05,350
The smell isn't coming from my feet
because they are wrapped up.

2172
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:06,740
Right?

2173
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,680
Ji Hyo, what are you doing?
It isn't you.

2174
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,740
- Ji Hyo.
- It's Ji Hyo.

2175
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:12,850
- It isn't me.
- Is it you?

2176
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:13,950
It isn't me.

2177
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:16,390
It isn't me.

2178
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:18,450
- My goodness.
- It isn't you, but this is...

2179
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:21,560
- It isn't me.
- It isn't you.

2180
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,620
We became very close.

2181
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,730
It must be Sae Ho.
His feet probably became sweaty.

2182
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,900
- No.
- Sae Ho.

2183
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,340
- No.
- Didn't sweat pool at the bottom?

2184
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,340
No.

2185
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,610
Who wants to go first?

2186
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,770
- We need action.
- I will sit on this side. Yes.

2187
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:37,200
- I will sit on this side.
- Slap the shin for real.

2188
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,480
- Like this.
- Yes. We should hear the sound.

2189
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,810
(Slapping)

2190
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:43,180
- Is that how you do it?
- You slapped too hard.

2191
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,440
- But...
- The sound should be big.

2192
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,690
Isn't that how you do it?

2193
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:47,810
- It is.
- That's how you do it.

2194
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,690
Is he supposed to hit my head?

2195
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,390
- I mean...
- No?

2196
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,890
- Isn't that how you do it?
- No.

2197
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:54,800
- I see.
- Hit me here.

2198
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:56,430
- Here?
- Don't hit my face.

2199
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,300
- Do well.
- Let's get started. Get ready.

2200
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:01,490
- Can I attack one side only?
- Yes.

2201
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,770
- Set, go.
- Hey.

2202
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:04,010
Don't make a fist.

2203
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,660
- Don't do that.
- Go.

2204
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:17,780
(He slaps Sae Ho's shin
with perfect accuracy.)

2205
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:19,240
Come on.

2206
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,150
Put it down.

2207
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:23,360
(It's like a comedy skit.)

2208
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,650
- Do it properly.
- I am doing it properly.

2209
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,730
- He slapped 11 times.
- That was so funny.

2210
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,600
- That was insane.
- Here I go.

2211
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:33,160
What is he doing?

2212
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:35,100
What is he doing?

2213
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,860
- You slapped 20 times.
- Okay.

2214
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,510
(He succeeded in slapping 20 times.)

2215
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:41,640
- You fool.
- He is an easy target.

2216
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,010
Why did you make it so easy for him?

2217
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:45,570
That was so funny.

2218
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,720
- He will guide us to dessert.
- Sae Ho is an easy target.

2219
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,020
- You made it so easy for him.
- Let me try it.

2220
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,310
That was so funny.

2221
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,550
Sae Ho, sit in the middle.

2222
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:54,150
- He is an easy target.
- That was insane.

2223
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:55,590
- For goodness' sake.
- He is an easy target.

2224
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:56,950
- Jong Kook, go ahead.
- Me?

2225
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,560
Why did you make it so easy for him?

2226
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:01,430
- He is an easy target.
- I can't believe you.

2227
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,600
For goodness' sake.

2228
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:06,320
- I just need to do well, right?
- Yes.

2229
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:08,030
Will we place last?

2230
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:09,140
(Startled)

2231
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,970
Look to the left.

2232
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,660
For example...

2233
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:14,510
- There you go.
- You got caught.

2234
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:15,700
- Like this.
- Yes.

2235
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:19,270
(Startled)

2236
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,520
What?

2237
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,410
My goodness.

2238
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,240
Slap and move your hand.

2239
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,740
- Like this.
- There you go.

2240
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:26,850
- There you go.
- He is good too.

2241
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:28,060
- He is good too.
- I got you.

2242
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,390
Okay.

2243
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:33,820
Jong Kook's eyes are on his hand.

2244
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,990
Get ready.

2245
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,190
(Out of 20 times,
how many times will Sae Ho slap?)

2246
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:39,520
Set, go.

2247
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,360
All right. He got caught.

2248
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,180
- Hey.
- Hold on.

2249
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:51,110
- Hold on.
- How are you so bad at this?

2250
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:53,050
- Switch places with me.
- Switch places.

2251
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:54,480
- I can't do it well.
- I will place second.

2252
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,780
- Suk Jin, we need to place second.
- Yes.

2253
01:12:58,150 --> 01:12:59,220
- Okay.
- Hit him.

2254
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,350
Set, go.

2255
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,810
He got caught.

2256
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:03,890
I hit you, right?

2257
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:05,480
(Ouch.)

2258
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:07,560
(Screaming)

2259
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,320
(He feels pain after a beat.)

2260
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,860
I feel bad for him.

2261
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,990
- It can't be helped.
- He is alone.

2262
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,530
He must be lonely.

2263
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:18,810
I hit you.

2264
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,980
(Hitting)

2265
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,570
He is getting hit so many times.

2266
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,110
- How many times...
- This is the last chance.

2267
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:27,150
It's over. He will place last.

2268
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,740
Okay.

2269
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,940
You slapped 12 times in total.

2270
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,110
- Jae Suk.
- Should I go?

2271
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:34,220
Go.

2272
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,410
Here comes Jae Suk.

2273
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:36,810
- The flippant man.
- Here comes Jae Suk.

2274
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:38,980
- I need to do so many things.
- Who wants to go?

2275
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,190
- Do you want to go?
- You should do it.

2276
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:41,300
- Should I do it?
- You should do it.

2277
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,950
I want to see this match.

2278
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:44,360
Seriously.

2279
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,100
Get ready.

2280
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,690
(It's a match
between the Grand Award winners.)

2281
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,440
(Will this end their relationship?)

2282
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,560
Jae Suk.

2283
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,730
Set, go.

2284
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:53,160
(Go.)

2285
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,770
- I hit him.
- You hit him.

2286
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,850
He hit him.

2287
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:03,070
(Jae Suk is quite fast.)

2288
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:04,190
For goodness' sake.

2289
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:05,810
For goodness' sake.

2290
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,690
(The slipper flies off.)

2291
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,780
Once you lose your rhythm...

2292
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:10,930
That's right.

2293
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:15,690
He is fast.

2294
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,430
He missed Jae Suk.

2295
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:18,970
- Hey.
- What?

2296
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,560
Jae Suk, Sae Ho is an easy target.
Attack Sae Ho.

2297
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,900
Don't attack Jong Kook.

2298
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,900
(Sae Ho shows off his charms
as an easy target.)

2299
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,230
Hit him properly.

2300
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:29,070
Your 20 tries are up.

2301
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:30,680
- What was that?
- He is done.

2302
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:33,110
- Sae Ho. What was that?
- I couldn't do it.

2303
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,180
- Okay.
- You were easy.

2304
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,770
- He's easy.
- He's easy.

2305
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:38,190
You should hit.

2306
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:39,410
- You should sit.
- Come here.

2307
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:40,810
- Jong Kook.
- You're safe.

2308
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,360
- What? It's your turn.
- Stay there.

2309
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,120
- You're the only one.
- Here?

2310
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,650
- Yes.
- It must be tough for Sae Ho.

2311
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,900
You should switch your legs.
Doesn't it hurt?

2312
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:52,770
- Can we switch?
- Sure.

2313
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:54,100
- For my leg.
- That's even better.

2314
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,400
He's right-handed.

2315
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,160
- He can expand.
- Good.

2316
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,730
- Okay.
- Can I use my right hand?

2317
01:14:58,730 --> 01:14:59,770
- Do I go?
- Yes.

2318
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:00,870
(Turning)

2319
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:02,110
- Let's watch.
- What?

2320
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,240
Aren't you going to look
anywhere else?

2321
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:07,680
- Sae Ho. You need to get a grip.
- Okay.

2322
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,740
(Jong Kook only aims at one side.
What will be the result?)

2323
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,610
Set, go.

2324
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,590
He's a boxer.

2325
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,090
- Look at Sae Ho.
- Poor Sae Ho.

2326
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,520
- He's hurt.
- Wait.

2327
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,950
Sae Ho.

2328
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,930
(Sae Ho resumes
with tears in his eyes.)

2329
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:24,160
His face turned red.

2330
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,470
Bring the slipper close.

2331
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:29,530
Come closer.

2332
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,860
He's hitting his own leg.

2333
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,200
(Sae Ho's hand is too slow.)

2334
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,400
Poor Sae Ho.

2335
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:38,110
(Angry)

2336
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:39,370
Poor guy.

2337
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:41,610
He won't run away.

2338
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,180
That's crazy.

2339
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,350
I feel bad for him.

2340
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:45,440
Poor guy.

2341
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,940
(Sae Ho's shin keeps
getting attacked.)

2342
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:48,060
He looks unstable.

2343
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,620
- You're too slow.
- No.

2344
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,400
Oh, he blocked.

2345
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,690
He blocked.

2346
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,190
Sae Ho. Keep the slipper close.

2347
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:05,010
You keep blocking.

2348
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:06,860
Wait.

2349
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,310
(Groaning)

2350
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:09,700
It's over.

2351
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,510
(Sae Ho is knocked out.)

2352
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:14,550
- You got hit 19 times.
- It was a delayed...

2353
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,940
- Seriously, Sae Ho.
- I made a delayed attack.

2354
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,440
Like this.

2355
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,520
(Sae Ho blocked only once
and got hit 19 times.)

2356
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,650
You're so funny.

2357
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:21,910
That was better.

2358
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,060
- You're next.
- You were so terrible.

2359
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,230
Anyone who wants to try
for the last time?

2360
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,430
Why play again?

2361
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:28,450
That's how you hit him.

2362
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,860
- She's good.
- I blocked her.

2363
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:32,100
He hit me here.

2364
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,470
- You can't do that.
- Then where do I hit?

2365
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,140
- "You can't do that."
- You can't hit the arm.

2366
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:36,900
- Let's not do that.
- She said you can't do that.

2367
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:38,310
Okay.

2368
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:39,730
(Captain Cho with multiple roles
tries for the last time.)

2369
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:40,840
It's over.

2370
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:43,810
(Screaming)

2371
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:44,850
One, two...

2372
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:46,810
- It's over.
- Is it?

2373
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,110
(It's over.)

2374
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:49,610
They're so funny.

2375
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:51,890
- We won.
- Comedians are so funny.

2376
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:55,890
You succeeded 4 times out of 20.
You're last.

2377
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:56,890
That was tough.

2378
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:59,060
- I'm so proud of my comedians.
- Good job.

2379
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:02,450
So, first place goes
to Team Jong Kook.

2380
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,320
(1st place, Team Jong Kook)

2381
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,860
- We take 2nd place.
- Team Ji Eun places 2nd.

2382
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:08,030
- Okay.
- Team Sae Ho places third.

2383
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:09,560
- Let's get some desserts.
- We placed second.

2384
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,060
Director. Do we need this later?

2385
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,570
There is a prize.

2386
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,400
The decision is up to you.

2387
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,610
I'll tell you
what the prize is later.

2388
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:19,680
I'm eating.

2389
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,940
- We need to eat.
- We need to eat first.

2390
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,940
Is the prize nice?

2391
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,550
If it's nice, I'm saving up.

2392
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:26,890
Let's save up.

2393
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:29,280
- I think the exchange rate is nice.
- It'll be nice this time.

2394
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,930
Do I get 30?

2395
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,860
Yes, you all get the same amount.

2396
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:35,360
It's the same,
but the exchange rate is different.

2397
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,430
Oh, I see.

2398
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:37,490
The value is different.

2399
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:38,690
- You learned that now?
- No.

2400
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:39,820
(The boy in plastic finally
understands the rule.)

2401
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,530
I knew it.
I just didn't understand it.

2402
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,510
Sae Ho. You should wear these.

2403
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,610
- They're better.
- I can wear them.

2404
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:48,610
(He got slippers.)

2405
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:51,050
- I got slippers.
- Let's check the exchange rate.

2406
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,310
- Done.
- We need 50 bills.

2407
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:53,700
Oh, 50 bills.

2408
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:54,850
We need to eat.

2409
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,150
It's 40 bills. Fine. I'm eating.

2410
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:57,720
This is better. I need to eat.

2411
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,910
I'm getting coffee at least.

2412
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,950
- Thirty and... Are you eating?
- Two, three, four,

2413
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,430
- One, two, three, four...
- five, six, seven, eight,

2414
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,190
- five, six,
- nine, ten.

2415
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:09,820
- seven, eight, nine, ten.
- One, two...

2416
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,860
I can eat.

2417
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,190
I'm getting coffee.

2418
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:16,030
I'm finally here. Time has come.

2419
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:19,230
I should've had the meal earlier
instead of the dessert.

2420
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:20,400
I'm hungry.

2421
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,940
Here are 50.

2422
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,030
(Suk Jin's here to exchange.)

2423
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:25,900
Two, three,

2424
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,720
four.

2425
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:28,940
I already handed them in.

2426
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:31,090
I have 50.

2427
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,260
- Why aren't you buying?
- I'm saving up.

2428
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:36,810
You never know what it'll be next.

2429
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:38,760
- It's better to use than to save.
- You should eat.

2430
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,320
- Ji Eun. Eat.
- Hurry up and eat.

2431
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,560
I want to take the prize.

2432
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,950
Should I just take the prize?

2433
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:44,320
I'm going for the prize.

2434
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,360
- I can't eat anyway.
- I can't eat anyway.

2435
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,270
But the prize might not be worth it.

2436
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,770
- It might not be worth it.
- I'm selling Jong Kook bills.

2437
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,030
- Should I sell them for a dollar?
- It's worth a lot.

2438
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:55,480
- I think that's better.
- For a dollar?

2439
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,310
Two Jong Kook bills up for sale.
It's worth a lot.

2440
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:58,980
What? I can't just give it to you.

2441
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:01,150
Give me slippers.
I'm selling these shoes.

2442
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,720
Give me slippers.
I'm selling these shoes.

2443
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,150
(Reselling designer brand shoes)

2444
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:08,760
Right. Sell them for a dessert.

2445
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,560
I think my feet are getting itchy.

2446
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,760
You should get them back soon.

2447
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,060
But I don't have enough to buy them.

2448
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,450
- For a dollar.
- You can't return them.

2449
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,100
(Exchanging Sae Ho's shoes
for a dollar)

2450
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:22,360
I'll get a dessert with this.

2451
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,660
What do you want for a drink?

2452
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:25,730
- Yogurt.
- I got blueberry.

2453
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:26,900
I'll have blueberry too.

2454
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,730
- Ji Eun. Did you save up instead?
- Yes.

2455
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,840
She said she'll give me a bite.

2456
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,400
- Let's share mine.
- Thank you.

2457
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,940
You can't share it.

2458
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,220
I'll pay her.

2459
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,550
- No. Ji Eun. I'm sorry, but...
- That's okay, right?

2460
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:39,150
- I'll pay her.
- There are rules.

2461
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:40,910
You gave me lobster.

2462
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:43,590
We have rules.

2463
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:44,730
So I had lobster earlier.

2464
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:47,090
I'll take this,
but I don't need this money.

2465
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:49,190
Is it Ji Eun?

2466
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:51,160
But I still saved ten.

2467
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,900
Because of Jong Kook.

2468
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,060
Is that okay?

2469
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:55,560
I'm not going to use it anyway.

2470
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,300
Look.

2471
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,560
- Why are you ripping it?
- She's not going to use it anyway.

2472
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,180
Give it to me
if you aren't going to use it.

2473
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,700
I'm going to decorate it.

2474
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,680
- It's here.
- It's coming.

2475
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:06,350
Who ordered blueberry?

2476
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:08,110
- Enjoy it, Se Chan.
- It looks good.

2477
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:09,310
Is that cake?

2478
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,850
I suddenly want it.

2479
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:12,020
Thank you.

2480
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,910
- I'm finally eating.
- Se Chan's finally eating.

2481
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,310
- Yes.
- Is that laver powder?

2482
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:16,910
He finally gets to have rice.

2483
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:20,820
It's ice cream cake.

2484
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,300
Is it cheese?

2485
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,470
It's got Sae Ho's face.

2486
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:26,100
That looks like half of a rice ball.

2487
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,320
- Is that cake?
- What is this?

2488
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,340
Is that ice cream?

2489
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,270
- Ice cream.
- It's cake.

2490
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,560
- Cake?
- It's cake.

2491
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,980
It's too greasy to eat
in an empty stomach.

2492
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:37,530
Is it too greasy?

2493
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:38,610
(The Korean food lover is eating
greasy rice.)

2494
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:39,850
It's oily.

2495
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:44,610
He ate everything today
from the start.

2496
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:46,720
- I ate everything.
- I know.

2497
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,950
- He has no regrets.
- You must be happy.

2498
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:52,020
Now, there's only one mission left.

2499
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:55,150
For the last mission,
you'll cast dice.

2500
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,360
If you want to change your team,
this is your last chance.

2501
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:01,060
- No.
- This is totally random.

2502
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:03,100
The sum of two people's dice
will determine the winner.

2503
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,610
- Okay.
- Two people's dice.

2504
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:05,610
If you're alone,
you may cast it twice.

2505
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,970
I have to play twice again?

2506
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,030
- If I'm alone?
- Yes.

2507
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,440
- Someone might join your team.
- So Min.

2508
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:11,270
- Yes?
- You should join me.

2509
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:12,650
Sae Ho. I'll go.

2510
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,200
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

2511
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:16,720
- That works for me.
- I'm moving to Sae Ho's team.

2512
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,780
I'm moving to Jong Kook's team.

2513
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:20,090
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

2514
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:21,190
Good.

2515
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:22,650
Ji Hyo secretly saved...

2516
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,620
- Jong Kook bills.
- I have Jong Kook bills.

2517
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,230
I have no place to go.

2518
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:27,900
- I'll stay here.
- Ji Hyo. Great choice.

2519
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,520
- Right. The dice.
- Let's go.

2520
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,470
The last game is the dice.

2521
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:35,030
Two people will cast the dice,

2522
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:36,990
and the ranking will be determined
in the order of a higher sum.

2523
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:40,560
- Good luck.
- Decide who'll cast it...

2524
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,900
- Okay.
- before casting it.

2525
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,680
I will reveal the prize.

2526
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:45,510
- It's pine mushroom.
- What?

2527
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:46,570
Wait. What?

2528
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:47,610
Natural pine mushroom?

2529
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:50,050
This natural pine mushroom is
worth 500 dollars.

2530
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:51,810
- It's really tasty.
- It's my favorite.

2531
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,720
- It's so good.
- I must take it home.

2532
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:54,780
It's...

2533
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:57,110
- I must take it home.
- It's so good.

2534
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:59,820
- I want to play.
- Let's eat one here.

2535
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,950
My goodness.

2536
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:03,120
If you make rice with it,
it's really good.

2537
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,020
It's worth 500 dollars?

2538
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,400
That's crazy.

2539
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,160
I really want it.

2540
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,940
I'm sorry, but...

2541
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,530
I usually give the prize to the guests,
but I'm taking it today.

2542
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:14,400
Me too. I won't make
concessions today.

2543
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,310
Ji Eun and Suk Jin will cast
from my team.

2544
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:18,310
Who's casting?

2545
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,850
- Do we go first?
- Cast it twice,

2546
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:22,240
and I'll take the higher sum.

2547
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,520
- Here we go.
- Go.

2548
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,240
(He must get a high number.)

2549
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,410
Okay. You just cast it.

2550
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:28,020
- Two.
- No.

2551
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,260
What do you mean no? It's two.

2552
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:32,390
- It's two. Admit it.
- Fine.

2553
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,060
We'll take turns.

2554
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:35,490
- Next is Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

2555
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,260
- One.
- Go, Suk Jin.

2556
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,820
- That's one.
- Oh, my mistake.

2557
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,190
- Why would you kiss one?
- Right. That's how you should cast.

2558
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,970
It touched the ground.
You don't mind?

2559
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:45,860
(And?)

2560
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,840
It touched the ground.
You don't mind?

2561
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:51,110
Two.

2562
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:53,400
- I thought it was six.
- You almost scared me.

2563
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:54,550
- Me.
- Do I go first?

2564
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:55,570
I'll go first.

2565
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:57,110
Good luck, So Min.

2566
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:59,220
Spin it a lot.

2567
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:00,550
- You got it.
- That's right.

2568
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:01,720
Even now...

2569
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,020
That's good enough.

2570
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:04,260
That's good enough.

2571
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,930
- He thought it was six.
- That's good.

2572
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,900
- Here.
- You need to spin it in the air.

2573
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:11,990
- We're all about the same.
- Yes.

2574
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:13,730
- This is your last turn.
- The last turn.

2575
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:15,940
(This number will determine
their rankings.)

2576
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:20,440
- One.
- Two or three.

2577
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,700
(It's 6.)

2578
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,010
That was crazy.

2579
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:25,510
Ji Hyo. That was amazing.

2580
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:26,740
What's gotten into her?

2581
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:28,350
- What happened?
- Ji Eun.

2582
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:30,220
- Let's go for six.
- Get six.

2583
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,280
- How?
- Get six.

2584
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,940
- Six.
- Six.

2585
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:36,280
(Captain Ji Eun saved up
for the prize until now.)

2586
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,560
Six.

2587
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,120
- Okay. We beat them.
- Two and three.

2588
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,520
- They'll get over five for sure.
- Five.

2589
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,120
- They'll get over five for sure.
- Five.

2590
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,820
- If they get five, it's a tie.
- You must get six.

2591
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,440
- You need to get three.
- Get six.

2592
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,270
- I'll show you.
- You need to spin it a lot.

2593
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:51,530
- I can do it.
- You can do it.

2594
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:52,860
Spin it. Okay. Good.

2595
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:02,070
(If he gets 6, he wins 1st place.
If it's 3 or more, he's 2nd place.)

2596
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:08,460
(Team Sae Ho wins 1st place.)

2597
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,110
- Go!
- You win.

2598
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:11,630
They win.

2599
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:13,480
They were so lucky.

2600
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,200
I think you two have good chemistry.

2601
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,540
- I think so.
- Right.

2602
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:18,480
First place, second place,
and third place.

2603
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,690
- Let me cast it again.
- No, you can't do that.

2604
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:23,120
They are lucky
when they are together.

2605
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,290
Okay. So Min.

2606
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:25,690
- We can't beat them.
- Okay. Do it.

2607
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:26,990
- How much do I have?
- My gosh.

2608
01:24:26,990 --> 01:24:29,120
- I don't have Sae Ho bills.
- You'll get more money.

2609
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,160
I have Ji Eun bills.

2610
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,830
I can't get the pine mushroom.

2611
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:34,370
- Oh, dear.
- I'm sorry.

2612
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:35,460
It's all right, Ji Eun.

2613
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,870
What matters is
the value of the money.

2614
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:38,500
What's the current exchange rate?

2615
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,630
(Sae Ho 90, Jong Kook 100,
Ji Eun 110)

2616
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:41,370
- Is it 110?
- I told you.

2617
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:42,460
Is it 110? Hang on.

2618
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,660
Seok Sam, how many do you have?

2619
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,440
I think I can make it.

2620
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,780
Go ahead and count them.

2621
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,280
- I have 40... I need 110.
- I can't make it.

2622
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,580
This is 40. So this should be 60.
I think I can make it.

2623
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:53,580
(Sae Ho 90, Jong Kook 100,
Ji Eun 110)

2624
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,690
No, I need 70.
It might not be enough.

2625
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:58,320
- Suk Jin, I'll give you 30.
- What? Really?

2626
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,690
You can't exchange money now.

2627
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:01,380
- We can't?
- We can't do that?

2628
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:02,690
Then this is...

2629
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:04,700
Then this will go to waste.

2630
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,590
I have a lot.

2631
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,070
Me too. I have 80.

2632
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:09,870
But Team Ji Eun didn't...

2633
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:11,940
You could've made it
if you didn't eat earlier.

2634
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,570
- This is 50.
- If you didn't eat the dessert.

2635
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:18,040
- Hang on. You're right.
- I know.

2636
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,870
I shouldn't have had the dessert.

2637
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,150
I'm so happy that I had the dessert.

2638
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,170
It's all right.

2639
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,580
You should go get the pine mushroom.

2640
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,080
I have the money.

2641
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,380
Ji Eun gets the prize.

2642
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:31,210
- Good for you, Ji Eun.
- My gosh.

2643
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:32,950
- You did it.
- I saved the money.

2644
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:35,990
- Thank you.
- Ji Eun gets the pine mushroom.

2645
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:37,050
(The captain finally got
what she wanted.)

2646
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:38,900
This is ten.

2647
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,700
This is 70.

2648
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:43,000
Gosh. Does Ji Eun have 110 dollars?

2649
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,700
My gosh, I have 100 dollars.

2650
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:46,660
(Does he have 100 dollars?)

2651
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:47,830
- You do?
- Yes.

2652
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:49,460
- That's amazing.
- This is worth 10 dollars, right?

2653
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:52,300
This is 50, 60,

2654
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:55,080
seventy, eighty,

2655
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:57,280
ninety, and a hundred.

2656
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,370
(Jong Kook gets the pine mushroom.)

2657
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:02,010
I have exactly 100 dollars.

2658
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:03,860
- You don't have enough?
- I have 100.

2659
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,050
You counted them.

2660
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:07,010
I have...

2661
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:09,750
I have 90 dollars here.

2662
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:13,030
I want my shoes back.

2663
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,660
(He gets his expensive shoes back.)

2664
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,240
I'm glad you got your shoes back.

2665
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,630
- I feel at ease now.
- I see.

2666
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:20,740
Bring in his shoes. There...

2667
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,760
- He got his shoes back anyway.
- So Min.

2668
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,580
I sold them, Sae Ho.

2669
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:26,480
He will need shoes
on his way back home.

2670
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,580
(Captain Cho managed
to recoup his loss.)

2671
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:30,250
He gave up the pine mushroom
to get his shoes back.

2672
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,250
(And Captain Kim won the prize
on her first time on the show.)

2673
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,670
We'd like to thank
the two guests again.

2674
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:33,990
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2675
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:36,010
(We thank Kim Ji Eun and Cho Sae Ho
for joining our show with smiles.)

2676
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:37,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2677
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:41,290
(He's No. 1 at playing soccer
with his mouth.)

2678
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:43,420
We have the president of FIFA here.

2679
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:46,030
(The carried-away president
of Running Man)

2680
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,960
(The president kept insisting
on watching the World Cup together.)

2681
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,120
(Do you have a camera?)

2682
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,240
(Is this for "Jiseokjin World?")

2683
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,740
(No. I'll watch it with my family.)

2684
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:53,740
(I don't want to watch it with you.)

2685
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,410
(Running Man is like family.)

2686
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,780
(They will shout their heads off,)

2687
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,300
(keep chatting...)

2688
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,780
(until their ears burst,)

2689
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,370
(and enjoy late-night snacks.)

2690
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,580
(Enjoy the World Cup
with Running Man!)

2691
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:09,320
(Will We Have
Our First Win in the World Cup?)

2692
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:10,320
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
