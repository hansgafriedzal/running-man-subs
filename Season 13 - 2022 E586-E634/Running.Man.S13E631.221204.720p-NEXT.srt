1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,160
(A month before the World Cup match between Korea and Ghana)

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,050
(Someone showed up before the members.)

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,530
(The fake president of FIFA)

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,460
(He took office showing off his lame foot skills.)

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,770
(He suddenly started singing the World Cup song loudly.)

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,730
(Then he suggested watching the World Cup game together.)

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,880
(Everyone was lukewarm about the idea.)

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,410
- No. - Then I'll go.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,410
Why would there be...

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,170
We should win today.

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,220
I hope we will win.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,620
I'm excited about the cheering squad too.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,520
The World Cup matches are so much fun.

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,130
There are a lot of things.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,090
- We have all sorts of stuff. - We have ramyeon too.

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,900
This is non-alcoholic beer.

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,900
(All sorts of snacks including non-alcoholic beer are ready.)

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,800
(Ji Hyo is the first one to arrive.)

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,100
The manager looks like Kwang Soo.

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,800
- He looks like Kwang Soo, right? - Really?

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,580
(While she feels an affinity with the manager of Ghana...)

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,050
Kwang Soo.

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,420
(The little Red Devil arrives.)

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,920
- I'm really disappointed in you. - Why?

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,520
One of our production crew...

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,580
bet money on Ghana's victory.

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,220
- That's not one. - There are a lot.

28
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,630
- Not just one. - That's the problem.

29
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,250
- Go, Korea! - Do you want us to lose?

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,560
Hi.

31
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,190
- Se Chan. - Yes.

32
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,330
The Ghanian team has four goalkeepers.

33
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,530
- What? - Four keepers?

34
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,060
The four goalkeepers are taking photos together.

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,530
- Why are there four keepers? - The keepers?

36
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,200
He's here. The soccer king is here.

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,410
Who's here?

38
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,280
- Shutdolyi is here. Mr. Shutdolyi! - Hey.

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,310
(The soccer king of Anyang shows up.)

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,140
Hey! I'm here.

41
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,580
Nice.

42
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,280
Go, Korea!

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
(President Ji who arranged this meeting shows up.)

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,080
- He's a honeybee. - Go, Korea!

45
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
Are you a honeybee?

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,190
- A honeybee. - I got this from someone.

47
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,300
Ji Suk Jin.

48
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,420
My gosh.

49
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,300
(Everyone is present now including Jae Suk.)

50
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,590
Go, Korea!

51
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,860
Let's go!

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,310
Gue Sung! There's Gue Sung.

53
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,700
Why are you addressing him casually?

54
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
- I mean... - Do you know him?

55
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,730
He's the nation's beloved player.

56
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,000
He's so popular.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
Gue Sung is the nation's beloved player.

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,570
President Ji of FIFA, put this one.

59
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,040
Okay. Thank you.

60
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,220
- The president of FIFA. - Yes.

61
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,990
Go, Korea!

62
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
This is nice.

63
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,810
That was really short.

64
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,030
He just did it once because of the cameras.

65
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,850
Just to show off.

66
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,690
You might get criticized.

67
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,690
What was her name? You look like Mina.

68
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,690
(You look like Mina from the 2002 World Cup.)

69
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,560
(Don't say anything and pick up the phone)

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
You look really hip.

71
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,470
Jung Woo Young and Hwang In Beom.

72
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,210
Suk Jin, you're wearing a knitted sweater.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,180
It's red.

74
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,120
I'm just sitting here...

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
And the horns you're wearing are out of shape.

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,490
Actually, he came wearing hearts, not horns.

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,560
What? Are you going to pick up some girls or what?

78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,280
- I think my stylist... - It's for picking up girls.

79
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,290
That's not for the Red Devils.

80
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,000
- Suk Jin. - Picking up a girl...

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,900
- at a bar. - I think my stylist hates me.

82
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,000
It has nothing to do with the World Cup.

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,290
- I found it strange when I got it. - What is this?

84
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,740
It looked strange.

85
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,570
It's a slow-motion replay of him.

86
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,310
Cho Gue Sung.

87
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,750
Cho Gue Sung used to be a center-back. A defender.

88
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,810
Really?

89
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,910
But he became a forward when he got into college.

90
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,590
He makes good headers.

91
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,010
- Nice. - He's good at it.

92
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,620
What? He's my boyfriend.

93
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,720
(Cho Gue Sung? He's my boyfriend.)

94
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,990
- Did you not know? - He's really popular.

95
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,060
- We're dating secretly. - Really?

96
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,500
In my heart.

97
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,190
If he scores a goal today... Seriously...

98
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,220
He'll be a star.

99
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,660
Well... He will buy an apartment in Hannam-dong...

100
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,210
and a Lamborghini.

101
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,440
Hannam-dong?

102
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,570
- Is he joining Running Man? - And he will join Running Man.

103
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,780
I hope he'll be here.

104
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,570
- He's handsome, right? - He really is.

105
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,220
He has a sexy face.

106
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,810
I bet Son Heung Min and Lee Jae Sung will score a goal each.

107
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,220
Lee Jae Sung isn't even in the starting lineup.

108
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,560
He's not in the starting lineup.

109
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,690
Will you at least check the lineup?

110
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,720
Who were you talking about?

111
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,630
Lee Jae Sung.

112
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,220
- But he's not in the lineup. - What's with him?

113
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,790
- In the second half. - That can happen.

114
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,560
Lee Kang In will definitely come in the second half.

115
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,970
We have to win.

116
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,500
- Gosh, that's scary. - I'm scared.

117
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,060
They look like sorcerers.

118
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,100
He looks amazing.

119
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,560
I'm somewhat overwhelmed.

120
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,900
He seems exhausted already.

121
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
He was on screen longer than he thought.

122
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,350
The screen wouldn't change.

123
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,070
- Hang on. - What do you want?

124
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,570
Do we have anything cool to drink?

125
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,810
Drink? Do we have anything to drink?

126
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,920
We have non-alcoholic beer and coke in the fridge.

127
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,990
Let me see.

128
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,880
Do we have any sandwiches or tender strips?

129
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,230
We have coke.

130
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,800
- I want this. - Jong Kook.

131
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,100
Thank you, Jae Suk.

132
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,500
- You're so kind. - Why?

133
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,310
He just gave this to me.

134
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,330
- Nonchalantly. - With a nonchalant air.

135
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,240
That's romantic.

136
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,880
It was romantic. The blood type B.

137
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,140
Why are you so touched?

138
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,980
What's with you?

139
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,550
We have 20 minutes left. This is crazy.

140
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,580
- Se Chan. - Yes?

141
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,310
What was that?

142
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,150
I'm really surprised.

143
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,880
What did you just do?

144
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,380
- Why? - He suddenly...

145
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,690
Jae Suk.

146
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,930
- What was that? - That was a little romantic.

147
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,000
- He's blushing. - Jae Suk.

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,940
That was romantic. Why did you do that?

149
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,690
What is he doing?

150
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,310
What's the matter with you?

151
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,500
It's romantic.

152
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,630
Why? I'm just eating.

153
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,110
This is a party. Everyone looks happy.

154
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,440
All right.

155
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,570
- Let's wait a little longer. - Suk Jin, you go.

156
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,620
I said 2 to 1. Why are they following me?

157
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,080
But you bet on Ghana's victory.

158
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,250
(Embarrassed)

159
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,190
People would believe that.

160
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,250
- You did say that. - That's ridiculous.

161
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,600
I'll make it different. I say 3 to 1.

162
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,890
- Three to one? - Yes.

163
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,730
- I'll go with 1 to 0. - Your guess is 1 to 0.

164
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,300
That sounds nice.

165
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,040
Se Chan, it will be more than 1 to 0.

166
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,830
I'm sure there will be a lot of goals.

167
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,000
You didn't even know today's starting lineup.

168
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,830
- It's not like that. - You didn't even check the lineup.

169
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,610
- This is more comfortable. - I do know the lineup.

170
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,070
Ghana has Kudus, the rising star of Ajax.

171
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,120
You should check Korea's lineup first.

172
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,250
Korea's lineup?

173
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,690
There's Cho Sung Gue...

174
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,210
- Cho Sung Gue? - That's Cho Gue Sung!

175
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,310
Cho Gue Sung.

176
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,290
Who is Cho Sung Gue? Is he a commentator?

177
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,290
You're the president here.

178
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,250
Can you cut this out for me?

179
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,250
- Hyung In, cut it out. - Cut it out for him.

180
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,960
- You should do that. - We should save Suk Jin.

181
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,690
(15 minutes before the match, Cho Gue Sung)

182
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,370
- There he is. - My gosh.

183
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,040
But for Korea...

184
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,380
- Not yet. - The number of cases of Group H...

185
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,900
Suk Jin, is this your first time watching a soccer game?

186
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,380
(Embarrassed)

187
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,680
It's not starting yet.

188
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,350
Do you know the rules?

189
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,580
- Stop it. - Is this your first time?

190
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,850
(Seok Sam's guardian angel is back.)

191
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,450
Stop what? I'm just asking.

192
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,080
What do you want me to stop?

193
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,750
Just look forward, you darn brat.

194
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,880
(Just look forward, you darn brat.)

195
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,130
(Seok Sam finally explodes.)

196
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,250
They will cut this out anyway.

197
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,730
They will cut this out anyway.

198
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,130
(He keeps saying things that will be cut out.)

199
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,700
The chicken we ordered will arrive in 15 minutes.

200
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,310
We should eat.

201
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,380
We need two of you to come with us to pick it up.

202
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,610
- Two people? - Really?

203
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,380
Two of the members should go?

204
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,810
We will go.

205
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,140
- Don't worry. - Sure.

206
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,380
- All right. - I'll go.

207
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,710
- No. Later. - We should go later.

208
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,120
During the game.

209
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,380
- What? - During the game.

210
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,950
(The soccer king changes his mind immediately.)

211
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,930
Hey, you already said that, so you should keep your promise.

212
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,130
He's unbelievable.

213
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,250
- I see. - Should we decide now?

214
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,170
- It will arrive during the game? - We can't decide during the game,

215
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,100
so why don't we decide who will go now?

216
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,440
No, I'll go.

217
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,540
I think the game will go well when I'm not watching.

218
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,370
- No, Ji Hyo. - That's not true.

219
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,560
- Okay. That's a good idea. - I'm too nervous to watch it.

220
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,630
That's a good idea. We should respect the jinx.

221
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,000
- Do we lose when you watch? - When I watch it, we lose.

222
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,270
No, it's like...

223
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,510
- No, Ji Hyo. - We might lose.

224
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,990
- It's just... - Let's throw a dice.

225
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,750
The two members with the lowest numbers will go.

226
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,450
Why don't we let the one with the lowest member choose the other?

227
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,290
- That sounds good. - Let's not do that.

228
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,490
- Let the loser choose. - Why not?

229
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,950
You don't want to do anything.

230
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,390
- All right then. - Just don't do it.

231
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,390
The two members with the lowest numbers will go.

232
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,390
The two with the lowest numbers.

233
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,670
- Okay. - Don't choose.

234
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,430
- I know you will choose me. - I won't.

235
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,890
- Okay. - The losers will go.

236
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,240
- The losers will go. - Two people.

237
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,550
You need a high number.

238
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,290
(What will his number be?)

239
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,640
- Two. Okay. - It's two.

240
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,470
(Sighing)

241
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,660
He's really unlucky.

242
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,010
- He really is. - Gosh. Why am I so unlucky?

243
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,170
He's really bad at this.

244
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,280
I'll go next.

245
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,510
(Next up is Se Chan.)

246
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,170
It should be one. Then you two will go.

247
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
- It's four! Come on! - Gosh, that's not good.

248
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,150
- He's safe now. - I'm safe.

249
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,240
He won't go.

250
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,840
I think So Min will go.

251
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,060
- I don't want to go. - There should be two ones.

252
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,320
It has to be one.

253
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,460
There should be two ones.

254
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,750
It has to be one.

255
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,850
- Two. - Two for two people.

256
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,060
(The current losers: Jae Suk and So Min)

257
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,090
For now, these two will go.

258
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,390
- You should get three. - What's wrong with you?

259
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,540
- I won't go if I get three. - What's with you?

260
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,670
- I won't go if I get 3. - Someone might get 1.

261
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,040
(He gets "one.")

262
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,340
He won't watch the game!

263
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,010
He won't get to watch it for five minutes!

264
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,970
Do the waves!

265
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,610
- Do the waves! - Can you believe this?

266
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,450
- You will go. - This is the worst.

267
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,960
- Can you believe this? - That's the worst.

268
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,980
- It's so funny. - How is this happening?

269
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,060
(After him...)

270
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,090
- Four. - How is this...

271
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,800
Haha, you should get one.

272
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,760
Jae Suk, if he gets one, you won't have to go.

273
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,390
- Right. Then I won't have to go. - He should get one.

274
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,730
(If Haha gets number 1 here, Jae Suk and So Min are safe.)

275
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,970
(What's Haha's number?)

276
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,130
It must be one!

277
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,870
(The descent of the Almighty of variety shows)

278
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,720
It's one!

279
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,950
Haha is going.

280
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,740
This is unbelievable.

281
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,790
- How could you get one? - It's so surprising.

282
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,010
- I'm safe. - Jae Suk.

283
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,010
- Okay. - Nice.

284
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,110
They will miss it for five minutes.

285
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,520
This is Running Man. Number two can survive.

286
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,160
- See you. - Are you all right?

287
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,330
It's starting now.

288
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,120
- Let's go. - Salute.

289
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,620
Darn it.

290
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,070
(The match finally begins.)

291
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,940
Let's go!

292
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,630
- We have to win. - Let's go!

293
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,740
- Long live our nation - Long live our nation

294
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,450
We will win. We can do this.

295
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,550
(Let's go!)

296
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,920
Let's go!

297
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,220
(Let's go!)

298
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,880
Go, Korea!

299
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,380
(Korea versus Ghana, the match begins.)

300
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,250
Here we go.

301
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,590
- Let's go! - It's begun.

302
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,890
So Min, did Cho Gue Sung call you before the game today?

303
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,730
With his heart. Telepathically.

304
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,540
So Min can't say he did.

305
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,080
People are watching.

306
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,770
Cho Gue Sung is really popular now.

307
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,340
- She might get criticized. - Right.

308
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,740
She doesn't want to be in trouble.

309
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,010
(Korea's offense)

310
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,460
It's Jeong Woo Yeong.

311
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,960
Kim Jin Su is on the right wing.

312
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,220
- A sharp pass. - Nice.

313
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,700
- Cross. - Yes!

314
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,990
Curl it.

315
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,390
- A sharp pass. - Nice.

316
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,830
Kwon Chang Hoon turns it. Shoot.

317
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,840
(The shot goes wide.)

318
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,200
- That was close. - We're really good.

319
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,310
- Nice. - That was a good one.

320
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,310
- There's a hole in Ghana's defense. - Our team is really good.

321
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,180
That was a brilliant pass.

322
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,340
If we keep pressuring them like that,

323
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,110
there will be holes in the rear defense.

324
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,580
They might try going for the rear.

325
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,450
That's what I just said.

326
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,160
This happens a lot.

327
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,830
They often say what I just said.

328
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,620
That happens to me too.

329
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,620
Ahn Jung Hwan does that.

330
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,660
(Korea's another counterattack)

331
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,860
- My gosh. - Good.

332
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,120
To the side. Good.

333
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,890
- There you go! - That's Son Heung Min.

334
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,070
- Go! - Son Heung Min dashes.

335
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,860
- Go! - Go, Son Heung Min!

336
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,500
- Nice. - Son Heung Min!

337
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,470
- It's a foul. - It's a foul.

338
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,230
(Korea gets a free kick in a good position.)

339
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,210
The chicken is here.

340
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,310
- Free kick. - You go.

341
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,920
- Suk Jin, you should go. - Go.

342
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,920
- I have to watch this. - Just go.

343
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,420
I should eat protein.

344
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,420
- Hurry and go. - Let me just watch this.

345
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,090
- We have to watch this. - Just this.

346
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,090
- Suk Jin. - Yes.

347
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,330
I'll go if you give me ten dollars.

348
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,880
Okay. Come here.

349
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,090
I'll wire the money.

350
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,170
- I'll send 20 dollars. - I'll wire the money.

351
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,070
Se Chan, I'll send 20 dollars.

352
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,470
I want 50 dollars.

353
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,570
- You should pay at least 50. - I want 50 dollars.

354
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,130
I'll go for 30 dollars.

355
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,100
You want 30? Deal.

356
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,050
Son Heung Min needs to be more aggressive now.

357
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,550
(Son Heung Min is ready for a free kick.)

358
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,820
I can't go.

359
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,110
Hey, I'm sending the money.

360
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,190
Suk Jin, I can't go. I have to watch this.

361
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,590
I'm sorry.

362
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,220
You said 30 dollars.

363
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,960
- I can't go. - The deliveryman is waiting...

364
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,290
- at the lobby now. - I'll go now.

365
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,480
I should go.

366
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,460
Hurry, So Min. I'll wire the money when you're back.

367
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,720
(They are forced to go and pick up the chicken.)

368
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,300
I didn't know I could hire someone with money.

369
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,440
Only with 40 dollars.

370
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,590
We have to hurry.

371
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,840
We should hurry.

372
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,840
For 40 dollars.

373
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,340
We practiced our set-piece play a lot.

374
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,950
(This is a crucial moment.)

375
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,100
Gosh, I can't stay seated.

376
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,770
I think this will be crazy.

377
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,510
- Kim Min Jae, go for a header! - Please.

378
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,240
Son Heung Min's cross.

379
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
- It's done. - It's a chance!

380
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,510
- My gosh. - Shoot!

381
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,320
- Shoot! - Don't hold it and just shoot.

382
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,960
- My gosh. - Who was that? Min Jae?

383
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,790
Shoot. Gosh, just shoot.

384
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,850
There will be another chance.

385
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,090
They're so good.

386
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,700
Take it slow. Pass it. Good.

387
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,090
Cross! That's right!

388
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,490
- They are really good. - They're doing a great job.

389
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,170
- They are good. - They really are.

390
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,540
That was great.

391
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,870
They are unbelievably good.

392
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,640
Gosh, that's impressive.

393
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,470
I feel bad that Jae Suk didn't see this.

394
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,910
(I feel bad that Jae Suk didn't see this.)

395
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,180
Things are going well.

396
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,010
- I hear something. - It's a chance! Shoot!

397
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,290
- Shoot! - Did they score? No?

398
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,660
I hear something. I think something happened.

399
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,020
First floor.

400
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,620
- They are so good. - They are amazing.

401
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,700
They are really good.

402
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,830
- It's in play. - Kim Min Jae!

403
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,200
- This is crazy. - The ball is in play.

404
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,220
It's a chance!

405
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,890
- I smell chicken. - I smell it too.

406
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,230
I smell the chicken.

407
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,130
(If a goal is made now, they're going to regret it forever.)

408
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,260
Thank you.

409
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,040
- Enjoy the food. - Thank you.

410
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,210
(They quickly take the chicken...)

411
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,410
(and walk fast.)

412
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,470
Hurry up.

413
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,310
They're coming.

414
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,450
- It was so fun, Jae Suk. - Really?

415
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,580
Thank you, Jae Suk.

416
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
- Thank you. - It was crazy.

417
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,450
- Was it? - What happened?

418
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,250
Try the most delicious chicken in the world.

419
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,250
This one?

420
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,830
It's so quick, right?

421
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,690
- One chicken for each of us. - They're going...

422
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,160
- to score a goal. - Good. It's from the same brand.

423
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,890
What happened?

424
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,430
- Is it a corner kick? - Let's go.

425
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,670
We can just take one. The two of us can share it.

426
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,670
(Eating)

427
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,700
Let's share it.

428
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
- Hold on. - Here.

429
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,500
It's delicious.

430
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,470
It's a long pass. Cho Gue Sung got it.

431
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,000
(Cho Gue Sung was elbowed at that moment!)

432
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,220
- He's hurt. - Who?

433
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,370
- No. - Who is it?

434
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,550
- Is it not Heung Min? - It's Cho Gue Sung.

435
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,920
He was elbowed.

436
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,980
Are you okay, So Min?

437
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,380
- Are you okay? Are you crying? - I'm fine.

438
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,380
All women will riot.

439
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,060
You don't know what to do?

440
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,300
(She can't react as she's scared of the aftermath.)

441
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,120
- If it blows up, So Min... - It's confusing.

442
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,670
She'll be ousted.

443
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,860
- Don't keep making me confused. - Okay.

444
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,540
Jordan Ayew.

445
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,600
Yes. Hwang In Beom cut it with a tackle.

446
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,910
(Hwang In Beom's foul grants Ghana a free kick chance.)

447
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,770
That was deep.

448
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,180
- It's dangerous. - Something like this is dangerous.

449
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,320
It's okay.

450
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,240
Block it.

451
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,190
The defenders should focus.

452
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,880
Kudus is getting ready to kick it with a left foot.

453
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,350
Jordan Ayew kicked it.

454
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,460
He kicks it one more time.

455
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,200
Korea allowed a goal.

456
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,520
(During the fierce fight in front of the goalpost, Korea allowed a goal.)

457
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,930
- No. - Hey.

458
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,670
Look at this.

459
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,600
- Things like this are dangerous. - I said it would be dangerous.

460
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,970
- It went in. - It's because I was watching.

461
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,340
No. But you get upset when you allow a goal like that, right?

462
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,970
You don't get so mad when they score because of their skills.

463
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,470
- But this was luck. - I told you. It goes in like that.

464
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,610
Something like this is dangerous.

465
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,220
- Now, when we push ahead... - They even check a shoulder seam.

466
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,460
- You don't know. - Semi-automated offside...

467
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,590
- was introduced at this event. - Was it offside?

468
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Their bodies are in the front.

469
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,720
It kind of looks like offside as well.

470
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,390
- It's handball. - It's handball.

471
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,620
(it's handball!)

472
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,340
- It's handball. - Okay.

473
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,200
- Okay. - It's handball.

474
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,670
- The goal is invalid. - It's handball.

475
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,310
- The goal is invalid. - The goal is invalid.

476
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,470
- The goal is invalid. - It's considered handball...

477
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,470
in the Premier League.

478
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,640
- Yes. It's handball. - But I'm not sure about World Cup.

479
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,770
About the ball...

480
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,640
- They're checking. - Please.

481
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,180
(Checking)

482
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,820
- I got goosebumps. - It's handball.

483
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,320
- Please remove the score. - It's a relief.

484
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,880
It's handball. If the ball...

485
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,690
didn't hit the arm,

486
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,790
it would've gone in a different direction.

487
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,790
That's true.

488
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,930
Please.

489
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,850
- He must know it hit his hand. - He must know.

490
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,700
- He's not the one. - He's not?

491
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,090
(Embarrassed)

492
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,570
(Checking)

493
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,600
They approved the goal.

494
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,630
(But he approved the goal.)

495
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,170
- It's a goal? - What?

496
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,180
(It definitely hit the arm, but he approved it without checking VAR.)

497
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,370
- It's a goal? How? - It's handball.

498
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,270
He's not even watching the video?

499
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,450
- He should go and check. - It hit his hand.

500
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,610
- Let's forget about it. - Let's forget about it.

501
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,010
- Why does he not go and check? - Why does he not go and check?

502
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,160
I should send a direct message.

503
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,330
- Send a message. - This won't do.

504
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,290
You know that poop emoji, right?

505
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,600
- The poop and the skull. - Yes.

506
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,670
And something like a snake.

507
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,990
When we played against Togo before,

508
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,290
we allowed a goal first then we scored two goals.

509
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,470
- Yes. - Right.

510
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,500
- It has just started. - It's fun to turn the tables.

511
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,710
Right. Let's turn the tables.

512
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,110
The deity of variety shows won't stay still.

513
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,240
- Of course not. - Of course not.

514
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,850
There's still a lot of time left.

515
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,540
- We still got 15 minutes left. - If they stay calm,

516
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,890
they will definitely have a chance.

517
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,390
We'll definitely have a chance. But if we're not lucky...

518
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,920
You're just repeating what they're saying like a parrot.

519
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,050
Was I?

520
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,860
- It's just I'm thinking fast. - Is it?

521
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,700
If you're going to do this, you should sit on my shoulder.

522
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,520
Talk here.

523
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,320
- I'm sorry. - He kept repeating them.

524
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,900
I don't feel like laughing right now.

525
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,760
He passed it to the side. Gideon Mensah.

526
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,500
(Ghana keeps attacking.)

527
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,110
He's waiting, without crossing it.

528
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,650
It's Jordan Ayew. He kicked the ball.

529
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,270
- Look at this. - No. Don't give it to him.

530
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,810
(They allowed a goal for the second time.)

531
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,480
You shouldn't let him cross the ball.

532
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,190
This is a big mistake.

533
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,280
You shouldn't let him cross the ball.

534
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,960
(They can't believe the opponent scored 2 goals in the first half.)

535
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,580
They can't crumble like this.

536
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,820
What should we do?

537
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,990
You got this.

538
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,830
You got this.

539
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,830
- Let's score to make up for it. - Yes.

540
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,470
Why did they not acknowledge that it was a handball?

541
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,470
Let's turn the tables.

542
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,830
Let's cheer for them until the end.

543
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,000
We can do it. If we score just one goal, the mood will change.

544
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,650
- Right. - One goal can change the mood.

545
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,570
They need to turn the tables within the remaining time.

546
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,310
- Blocking. There you go. - Cho Gue Sung went for a header.

547
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,980
- The opposite side. Give it to him. - This...

548
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,080
They got it.

549
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
Son Heung Min.

550
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,980
He keeps the ball and goes for it again. Son Heung Min.

551
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,580
- He should've kicked it earlier. - He passes the ball first and...

552
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,200
(Kwon Chang Hoon's canon shot)

553
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,220
It was nice, Kwon Chang Hoon.

554
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,560
- It was nice. - Well done.

555
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,830
That was very good.

556
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,030
- It was nice. - Let's keep the energy.

557
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,530
- Let's go. - Let's seize a chance.

558
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,000
We can do it. Let's go.

559
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,110
It was nice.

560
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,330
I shouldn't watch it.

561
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,470
So that defenders won't gather around Son Heung Min.

562
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,310
Ji Hyo, go home then.

563
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,770
Why? What's the matter?

564
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,920
She thinks we're losing because she's watching.

565
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,080
- Active moves... - Yes.

566
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,390
My gastritis came back.

567
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,460
- Are you okay? - It hurts a lot because of stress.

568
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,160
This is so annoying.

569
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,260
We had so many corner kicks, but none of them...

570
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,790
- He's good. - This is so hard.

571
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,100
The ball was hit.

572
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,300
We have 45 minutes in the second half. It's fine.

573
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,440
(The first half ends 0 to 2 in the end.)

574
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,880
Okay. Let's get ready.

575
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,910
(It's half-time for the members as well.)

576
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,880
I should go to the bathroom.

577
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,180
First, let's remove all the negative energy.

578
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,510
Let's remove it.

579
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,420
- Let's empty it. - Let's set it up again.

580
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,480
Empty your body.

581
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,550
If you think you're unlucky, please go out.

582
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,220
- I'll go out. - All the negative energy...

583
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,460
- I'll go out too. - I think I should leave too.

584
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,930
We need to remove everything that is iffy.

585
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,020
Anyone who is unlucky.

586
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,290
- Erase them all. It's over. - Okay.

587
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,300
- Start over in the second half. - Okay.

588
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,970
- Yes. - Let's do it again.

589
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,230
Let's start in a good mood.

590
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,800
(Sighing)

591
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
(Solemn)

592
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,880
Everyone...

593
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,480
is a little devastated.

594
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,540
(No one is laughing at the Variety Show Department office.)

595
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,250
We need a drastic change.

596
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,550
This is not working.

597
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,160
Jong Kook, book a flight and go to Qatar.

598
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,700
- I should go. - You can't do this here.

599
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,930
- You should go. - I should go and talk to them.

600
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,470
- You should go. - This is...

601
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,260
This is a must.

602
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,700
Gosh.

603
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,330
I've been waiting for this day since two years ago.

604
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,110
Are you serious?

605
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,380
- Two years ago? - I've been waiting.

606
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,880
- When? - Waiting for the World Cup?

607
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,720
- Of course. - Two years ago?

608
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,690
I have been waiting for this day since the qualification.

609
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,620
That was before the final draw.

610
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,280
- My mom... - That was before the final draw.

611
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,020
- I... - It's so fake.

612
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,290
- I've been waiting. No. - Doesn't it sound too fake?

613
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,820
- I've been waiting. - That was before the final draw.

614
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,320
How did you know we would play against Ghana?

615
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,060
I've been waiting since I was in my mom's belly.

616
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,870
- One to zero? - After the second half begins,

617
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,910
- We should score quickly. - we should score quickly.

618
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,440
We should score quickly in the beginning.

619
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,070
If we score quickly, they should catch up.

620
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,910
- Let's score a goal in 15 minutes. - No. In 3 minutes.

621
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,920
It's our 2nd match. The 2nd half is starting now.

622
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,810
- Good luck. - This...

623
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,120
- Let's go. - Let's go.

624
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,720
- We can do it. - Let's go.

625
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,720
We can do it.

626
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,750
Let's go.

627
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,550
(They take it up a notch and cheer for the second half.)

628
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,190
- Good. - Yes.

629
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,660
Pressure them. Don't make them pass the ball.

630
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,430
- There you go. It's not a foul. - No. Just turn. Why?

631
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,820
- Turn. Why? - Nice.

632
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,100
Yes. That's how you pressure them.

633
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,440
You should score a goal.

634
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,500
You should give it to him.

635
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,760
Give it to Gue Sung when he cuts it. Why don't you give it to him?

636
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,970
- Jong Kook is very angry. - I mean...

637
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,210
- Because... - Take it.

638
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,740
They're too hesitant to kick.

639
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,740
They need to tell them to turn.

640
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,070
It's so frustrating.

641
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,120
(When they were losing smiles...)

642
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,450
It's fine.

643
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,480
They should make a bold move in a dangerous zone.

644
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,080
Try it. You're fast.

645
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,460
- He's bursting through them. - There you go.

646
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,480
It was so...

647
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,630
- Good. - That's...

648
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,820
That was too early.

649
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,900
(But he missed the opportunity.)

650
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,100
Cho Gue Sung followed Kudus to slow him down.

651
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,970
Don't dance.

652
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,970
"Don't dance."

653
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,800
"Don't dance."

654
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,770
It's too bad. It was so close.

655
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,850
I think they can score a goal if they have more confidence.

656
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,420
Yes. Kim Jin Su crosses the ball with his left foot.

657
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,570
- Goal. - Yes.

658
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,890
There you go.

659
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,810
- He did it! - Okay.

660
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,750
- Did he block it? - It's Cho Gue Sung.

661
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,860
(He blocked it?)

662
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,430
- He blocked it. - He blocked it?

663
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,860
Why did he block it?

664
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,560
He blocked it?

665
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,370
- He blocked it? - It would've definitely gone in.

666
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,520
- It was so close. - The way he crossed it was good.

667
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,760
Kim Jin Su should keep passing the ball.

668
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,230
It was a sharp cross.

669
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,470
And Cho Gue Sung kicked it.

670
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,940
He blocked it.

671
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,270
- Goalkeeper Ati-Zigi hit it away. - He blocked it.

672
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,800
It was close.

673
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,850
- It was close. It could've gone in. - He blocked it.

674
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,470
He really had to be there.

675
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,010
He can't read the room.

676
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,350
- Why did he block it? - The atmosphere is nice.

677
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,750
- It has come. - That's it.

678
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,460
- That's Cho Gue Sung's forte. - Things started to work for us.

679
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,430
- How come... - He spat on the ground.

680
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,960
Please.

681
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,990
(He's telling on him without a good reason in a childish manner.)

682
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,970
"He spat on the ground."

683
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,970
I was talking to the referee.

684
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,610
"He spat on the ground."

685
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,210
(While Little Cheerleader who is upset is nitpicking everything...)

686
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,370
I'm upset.

687
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,140
- Someone is coming out. - It's Lee Kang In.

688
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,710
- Lee Kang In. - Let's go.

689
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,950
- Kang In. - Nice.

690
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,380
Let's go, Kang In.

691
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,480
I guess Bento wants to win. He put in Lee Kang In so early.

692
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,890
Yes. Lee Kang In is a good choice.

693
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,550
- He did well. - You got this.

694
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,580
Good job.

695
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,080
- You got this. - He worked hard.

696
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,780
- Let's score just one goal. - His body looks light.

697
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,490
- Give it to Lee Kang In. - Give it to Lee Kang In.

698
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,290
Lee Kang In has enough space. It's not the time now.

699
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,370
(What?)

700
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,470
Hey. You're right.

701
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,700
Are you going to explain every little detail?

702
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,110
- You're right. - Will you explain everything?

703
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,470
I'm right. It's not the timing now.

704
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,910
He should've passed it to him when you told him to do so earlier.

705
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,000
- Yes. But it was late. - Okay.

706
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,610
- It's fine. - The pass is...

707
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,010
(At that moment)

708
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,120
- Kang In. - Nice.

709
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,010
- There you go. - There you go.

710
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,420
- Lamptey. - Lee Kang In took the ball.

711
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,510
(Lee Kang In made a chance.)

712
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,890
- Goal! - Goal!

713
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,080
He did it!

714
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,200
(It's finally a goal!)

715
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,930
He did it!

716
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,700
My goodness.

717
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
He did it.

718
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,000
- I told you. - We scored a goal.

719
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,300
- He did it. - Lee Kang In.

720
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,210
- He did it. - He made it.

721
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,800
We did it.

722
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,000
We made it.

723
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,070
- We did it. - We did it.

724
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,510
- We did it. - We did it.

725
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,850
- We did it. - We did it.

726
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,690
We did it. I told you.

727
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,780
- Yes! - Yes!

728
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,390
(He's almost screaming.)

729
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,630
Look at Kang In.

730
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,700
(Excited)

731
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,990
(A precise cross)

732
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,790
(And an excellent header)

733
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,560
Kang In is good.

734
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,800
Kang In is the best.

735
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,500
Cho Gue Sung, go!

736
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,380
- That's what I'm talking about. - I told you.

737
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,270
- Now, it's good. - That's what I'm talking about.

738
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,850
- Lee Kang In. - That's what I'm talking about.

739
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,220
Lee Kang In was one step faster.

740
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,650
- Yes. - He did it.

741
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,220
Lee Kang In is definitely different.

742
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,690
His cross was so precise.

743
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,690
It was neat.

744
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,980
Send a direct message to him.

745
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,980
We'll score a goal in 15 minutes through the 2nd half.

746
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,280
- We should score a goal. - It's good.

747
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,320
- I told you it'd be Lee Kang In. - We'll score one more goal.

748
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,700
- Kang In. - No.

749
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,930
- It's Heung Min. - It's Son Heung Min.

750
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,670
(At that moment!)

751
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,200
- There you go. - Yes.

752
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,210
Lee Kang In and Hwang In Beom. Son Heung Min to the side.

753
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,260
Kim Jin Su kicked it. On the other side...

754
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,270
Yes.

755
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,910
(A consecutive goal in 3 minutes)

756
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,910
- Yes! - Okay!

757
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,810
(This is crazy.)

758
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,250
(The president's legs gave in.)

759
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,780
(The equalizer even made the Tiger cry.)

760
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,600
(They're making a fuss.)

761
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,490
(The thrilling goal makes them shiver.)

762
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,600
Let's go.

763
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
(The thrilling goal makes them shiver.)

764
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,990
We did it.

765
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,260
- We did it. - Let's go.

766
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,410
(It's magic that makes everything look adorable.)

767
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,470
We did it. Okay.

768
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,620
- Okay. It's good. - I'm crying.

769
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,450
I'm crying.

770
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,050
- We did it. - I love you, Bento.

771
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,660
- Mr. Bento... We did it. - Mr. Bento.

772
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,750
Lee Kang In changed the atmosphere.

773
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,900
Bento made a great choice.

774
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,550
- Go, Korea! - Go, Korea!

775
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,900
(Go, Korea!)

776
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,700
- Go, Korea! - Go, Korea!

777
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Hey.

778
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
- Hey. - Oh, gosh.

779
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,170
- Okay. - Did you see that?

780
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,000
- They're not dancing. - Let's dance.

781
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,610
(Let's dance!)

782
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,610
Like that?

783
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,650
(The cheering battle where they receive a little and give a lot)

784
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,810
Like that?

785
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,240
(Little Cheerleader is having fun only now.)

786
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,810
This is crazy.

787
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,280
- Lee Kang In completely changed it. - That's so cool.

788
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,460
I know. The atmosphere completely changed.

789
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,630
Today's game is so fun. How can it be so...

790
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,990
Why is it...

791
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,520
We got so much footage to air.

792
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,170
It's really amazing.

793
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,940
I told you. The deity of variety shows won't stay still.

794
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,170
- Right. - When we set up all of this.

795
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,640
This is so fun.

796
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,180
I teared up.

797
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,210
- Now, I... - Kook Jong was crying.

798
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,180
Yes. I'm about to get emotional.

799
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,380
- This is crazy. - Let's cross again.

800
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,810
- Gue Sung. - Let's go for a hat-trick.

801
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,270
You should give it to him.

802
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,220
There you go.

803
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,050
They definitely look intimidated.

804
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,250
- Three people are marking Gue Sung. - That's interesting.

805
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,080
- They're intimidated. - It's so interesting.

806
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,820
(At that moment)

807
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,200
(The ball crossed the halfway line.)

808
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,900
He blocked it. He kicks it.

809
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,530
- It's okay. - No.

810
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,530
(In the end, they allowed a go-ahead goal.)

811
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,670
(Disappointed)

812
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,180
My goodness.

813
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,380
- That's... - Did it go in?

814
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,650
The shot was...

815
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,620
I'm dumbstruck.

816
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,350
- What happened? - It's so...

817
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,550
You shouldn't let your guard down.

818
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,080
We can do it. It's fine.

819
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,930
- Let's do it. - It's okay. We have time.

820
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,750
- We can do it. - It's enough for two goals.

821
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,100
We can do it.

822
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,360
You got this.

823
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,600
It'd be amazing if we win after all this.

824
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,900
I guess they're dragging time.

825
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,470
But for the World Cup this time, even if they drag time...

826
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,530
- Later... - They will give them extra time.

827
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,940
I think they will give them at least ten minutes more.

828
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,680
- Yes. - The injury time.

829
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,770
I'm looking forward to Lee Kang In's free kick.

830
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,040
I'm going crazy.

831
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,220
Get ready to scream. It will go in.

832
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,220
Will it go in?

833
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,690
Lee Kang In.

834
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,190
(The Ghanaian goalkeeper blocked it again.)

835
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,600
- Nice. - His kick was very good.

836
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
(How can he...)

837
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
- It was a precise kick. - The kick was great.

838
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,990
- That was incredible. - Nice.

839
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,900
This is so...

840
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,560
- This game is really... - It's the best ever.

841
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,170
- This is so fun. - I'm going crazy.

842
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,260
- It's nerve-wracking. - But it's nerve-wracking.

843
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,940
It would be so nice if we win and have fun.

844
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,470
- It's nerve-wracking. - If we scored three goals...

845
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,270
It'd be amazing.

846
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,680
- Don't act up. - Be quiet.

847
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,690
(They're mad at innocent people as they're upset.)

848
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,150
So annoying.

849
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,920
I can't watch.

850
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,080
Let's score just one goal at 38 minutes.

851
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,780
I can't watch.

852
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,990
- Why? Are you scared? - Yes.

853
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,520
My heart is beating so fast.

854
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,560
It's an emotional rollercoaster.

855
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,990
It's okay.

856
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,490
We still have a lot of time.

857
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,170
(She watches then shuts her eyes.)

858
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,210
It was close.

859
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,260
(She watches then shuts her eyes.)

860
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,070
(Then she watches again.)

861
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,270
Look.

862
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,110
(Pale)

863
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,470
- So Min. - So Min.

864
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,950
- I'm so nervous. - Are you okay?

865
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,920
- I'm so nervous. - You're exhausted.

866
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,040
I'm so nervous. My heart is beating so fast.

867
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,480
I should think this is a rerun and watch it.

868
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,860
We won the game. And we're watching a rerun.

869
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,890
(They got a corner kick chance with 1 minute of extra time left.)

870
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,660
- The opponent is perplexed. - Yes.

871
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,720
- You got this. - You got this.

872
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,990
- You can do it. - You can do it.

873
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,790
Lee Kang In is so cool.

874
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,290
Seriously.

875
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,000
They got one minute left. But they might give them...

876
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,680
- Please. - more extra time. Lee Kang In.

877
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
A header.

878
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,210
- Just one more. - Kim Moon Hwan is following.

879
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,410
It's okay.

880
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,910
We still have time.

881
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,720
- Hwang In Beom to Na Sang Ho. - Let's go.

882
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,650
After the header, Na Sang Ho is following the ball.

883
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,810
It's out for now.

884
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,420
It's fine.

885
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,050
Sang Ho, we still have time.

886
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,160
- Let's do it. - Please.

887
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,720
(Yang Yeoguri is praying as well.)

888
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,100
Na Sang Ho.

889
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,760
- Son Heung Min. - Please.

890
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,440
- He got it. - Pass it.

891
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,640
He got it and heads it.

892
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,530
- There's no one. - Lee Kang In.

893
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,800
- Lee Kang In. - Kick it.

894
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,910
Shoot. It's out.

895
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,210
It was too strong.

896
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,300
(It's a pity.)

897
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,220
It was a good kick though.

898
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,450
- It was good. - It was good.

899
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,190
I'm so upset about that one goal earlier.

900
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,250
(The one that wasn't considered as handball)

901
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,750
We should block it and try one more time.

902
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,750
Yes.

903
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,900
(When the extra time is almost over)

904
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,520
- They're not going to finish it. - I think he's taking out a card.

905
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,820
- It won't be over like this, right? - No.

906
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
- He should go forward. - He should go forward.

907
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,790
He's going forward. Kwon Kyung Won. Is he going to kick it?

908
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,410
The ball hit him and went out. It's a corner kick.

909
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,830
(Sports caster Bae Seong Jae)

910
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,640
- What? - How can they...

911
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,110
- It's a corner kick. - Just one more goal.

912
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,710
- One last chance. - Just one more goal.

913
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,270
It's over?

914
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,310
(It's over?)

915
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,360
(The game suddenly ended before the corner kick chance.)

916
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,480
- What? - How can they end it...

917
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,580
before a corner kick?

918
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,630
Come on.

919
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,790
- They were lying down and stuff. - It was a corner kick.

920
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,900
The referee just ended the game.

921
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,290
(No matter how much they think about it, it's baffling.)

922
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,760
- Is he given a red card? What? - He gave Bento...

923
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,710
(He even gave Bento a red card.)

924
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,910
I'm speechless.

925
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,270
I don't understand the judgment.

926
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,070
They had a good chance.

927
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:04,720
(The game with Ghana ended before a corner kick chance,)

928
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,160
(but the players did their best.)

929
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,900
(The game with Ghana ended like this.)

930
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,560
(They're quiet as they're disappointed.)

931
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,790
How can he end it in the middle of it?

932
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,100
The final whistle is blown.

933
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,170
But they did a great job.

934
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,640
- Now, - Portugal should...

935
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,570
- win Uruguay, right? - Ghana should lose against Uruguay.

936
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,800
- Then... - Yes.

937
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,040
Portugal should win against Uruguay...

938
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,510
- early in the morning today. - They should win.

939
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,420
- That's right. - Then...

940
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,920
lastly, we should win...

941
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,250
- against Portugal. - Against Portugal.

942
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,660
- Then it's possible. - We can make it to the Round of 16.

943
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,250
Right. It's possible.

944
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,990
(And it really happened.)

945
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,370
It's the 1st time in 12 years.

946
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,260
The Asian Tigers made it to the Round of 16 again.

947
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,440
This is the Asian Tigers.

948
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,800
(President Ji's short clip)

949
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,110
(Let me make predictions.)

950
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,470
(We'll win against Uruguay 2 to 1.)

951
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,810
(We'll win against Ghana.)

952
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,920
(And we'll lose against Portugal.)

953
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,240
(Wrong or not, he hoped Korea would make it to the Round of 16.)

954
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,160
(The group viewing of the game where everyone was immersed is over.)

955
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,460
(The members gathered in Yeoui Island this time.)

956
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,190
- Hello. - Hello.

957
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,790
- There's a lot of beer. - It's a beer pub.

958
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,100
What is this? It's beer.

959
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,170
Are you sure we can drink this all?

960
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,600
- If you press this... - They're taking care of all this?

961
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,290
There are containers inside.

962
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,670
It's not an indirect advertisement.

963
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,670
(Writer)

964
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,610
Is it for all family members?

965
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,830
Not all family members.

966
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,610
- I love this place. - This place is so hip.

967
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,950
So Min got her hair dyed.

968
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,850
- Where? - She's NewJeans.

969
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,450
I thought you got ketchup on your hair.

970
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,620
What are you doing?

971
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,690
(A fake NewJeans member whose hair is the only thing that's hip)

972
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,480
- Red Devils. - Well...

973
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,190
So Min is obsessed with youth these days.

974
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,780
I thought you dipped your hair in yukgaejang.

975
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,460
Why are you saying that? She's our mascot.

976
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,790
Haha is my role model.

977
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,990
- Yes. You two are similar. - Why are you saying that suddenly?

978
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,320
Why are you picking on So Min?

979
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,030
- You must feel threatened. - She's still...

980
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,990
- She's still like a 20-year-old. - Yes, I feel threatened.

981
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,440
She even has earrings on.

982
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,030
- She has a fur beanie on. - Right.

983
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,910
- I went all the way today. - You look young.

984
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,070
- Exactly. - She looks younger than her age.

985
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,470
- Young So Min. - Nice.

986
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,800
- The MZ generation. - Don't you think...

987
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,880
the beanie should be pulled down?

988
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,190
- It should cover your ears. - Like so.

989
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,390
(Dragging down)

990
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,520
- Suk Jin, don't! - This looks more adorable.

991
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,220
- This is better. - Isn't this what you wanted?

992
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,290
- It's the hermit crab. - That's what you wanted.

993
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,620
- Doesn't she look cute? - Right.

994
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,850
- Isn't that a hermit crab? - You couldn't help yourself.

995
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,890
Don't ruin her NewJeans look.

996
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:34,140
- NewJeans! - Is there a number you like?

997
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,930
- Yes. - Of course.

998
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,160
- I have one. - Me too.

999
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,700
You'll all be given a sketchbook...

1000
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,180
in which you'll write down...

1001
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,850
the number that might bring you luck.

1002
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,450
- Can it overlap? - Any number?

1003
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,810
- It's all fine. - Really?

1004
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,080
There isn't a number I particularly like.

1005
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,220
Can others see it?

1006
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,410
Which number should I write down?

1007
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,450
(They all write down a number.)

1008
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,250
- You like the lucky number three. - Right.

1009
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,680
- Then I... - Three? What about you?

1010
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,390
- One. - I like one as well.

1011
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
- One and three. - Jae Suk must like one...

1012
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,700
since he's also in first place.

1013
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,770
- He likes the number one. - I like one and seven.

1014
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,160
Eight has been the number for me since an early age.

1015
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,270
My mom breathed it into me.

1016
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,410
It's in our phone number too.

1017
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,770
- There's always number eight. - One and seven.

1018
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,410
I used to live in Unit 806, so eight is a familiar number.

1019
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,950
- Unit 806? - I lived there for 20 years.

1020
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,750
- Go with five. - That's a number I like.

1021
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,540
- Really? - I like the number five.

1022
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,750
I'll go with a number that hasn't been written down.

1023
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,810
No one went with seven or four.

1024
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,020
I'll go with the deadly four.

1025
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,930
Go with seven. No one chose that number.

1026
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,750
- Not fearing death is how you live. - Seven.

1027
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,450
Go with seven.

1028
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,370
- I will if that's what you want. - There you go.

1029
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,560
- What's with him? - How sweet of him.

1030
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,000
When did he become this nice?

1031
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,390
- I'll go with seven. - How sweet of him.

1032
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,730
- I'll do as Jae Suk says. - He's the sweetest.

1033
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,910
- That's what I've been telling you. - Right.

1034
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,910
If you're done, please show us the number you chose.

1035
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,200
Sure thing.

1036
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,020
- Here. - I'll go with nine.

1037
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,520
One, three, seven,

1038
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,640
- Five. - Five,

1039
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,040
nine, eight, and eight.

1040
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,890
Let me show you the meaning behind the number you chose.

1041
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,730
- What is it? - I switched from three.

1042
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,890
What could this be about?

1043
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,430
They're giving us food!

1044
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,600
(Food?)

1045
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,100
The number must correspond with a different snack.

1046
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,230
Is that tofu? It looks like one.

1047
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,970
- It's a cake. - Isn't this coriander?

1048
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,410
That I can't have.

1049
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,830
I wrote down the number one.

1050
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,270
(Number 1: Iced Americano)

1051
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,410
- Lucky you. - I love bagels.

1052
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,370
- All I get is coffee? - It's a bagel.

1053
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,450
It's coriander.

1054
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,140
- This is coriander. - Is this it?

1055
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,390
What on earth?

1056
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,250
- What's going on? - You were served the dessert...

1057
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,250
that corresponds...

1058
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,310
- with the number you chose. - Really?

1059
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,620
The list was written beforehand.

1060
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,450
Please go ahead and check what was served.

1061
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,750
(The dessert varies depending on the number.)

1062
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,370
- Iced Americano. - Iced tea with an extra shot.

1063
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,730
- Coriander cake. - Mineral water.

1064
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,970
- Coriander-ade. Seriously? - Coriander-ade?

1065
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,930
Bagel's a good one. See what I mean?

1066
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,330
- I'm glad I listened to you. - See?

1067
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,540
- Orange ade. - Nine. Iced tea with an extra shot.

1068
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,270
- Ice tea. - Suk Jin was served iced tea.

1069
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,810
Iced tea with an extra shot.

1070
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,180
We made pretty good choices though.

1071
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,390
I don't mind coriander,

1072
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,850
- but as a soft drink? - It's a first.

1073
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,120
- Coriander ade. - Yes, coriander ade.

1074
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,220
Hold on. Is this actually sold at cafes?

1075
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,080
- Really? - Yes.

1076
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,060
These were all bought from a dessert shop.

1077
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,430
- No way. - The coriander is wilted.

1078
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,020
I think the cake will taste nice.

1079
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,540
(Visually, it isn't appealing.)

1080
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,060
(She tries a bite.)

1081
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,580
I think the cake will taste nice.

1082
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,330
- Hold on. - Coriander ade?

1083
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,980
It's not that bad.

1084
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,450
You'll have to try it with the coriander to know for sure.

1085
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,580
- It's weird though. - What on earth?

1086
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,040
What am I tasting?

1087
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,390
(It takes an acquired taste to enjoy the dessert.)

1088
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,020
I don't think I can eat this.

1089
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,790
Is this from a trending cafe?

1090
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,450
I love them all.

1091
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,730
I bet that's good.

1092
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,200
That suits my palate.

1093
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,160
I haven't tried any, but I love the cake.

1094
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,200
- It suits my palate. - Because it's trendy?

1095
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,000
The coriander cake is the worst.

1096
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,430
Hold on. Let me try some.

1097
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,370
- Do you eat coriander? - Can you stand it?

1098
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
I...

1099
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,870
- I don't go looking for it. - I didn't use to eat it,

1100
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,890
but it's been growing on me recently.

1101
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,220
Don't you think that's too much?

1102
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,620
Try it.

1103
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,020
You should have the leaves too.

1104
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,120
Is it trendy?

1105
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,750
It seems okay at first,

1106
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,750
- but then... - It comes crashing.

1107
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,200
- The more you savor it... - Exactly.

1108
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,060
The sourness comes through.

1109
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,870
- It's not bad. - Really?

1110
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,100
- Try some. - I like coriander, but the smell...

1111
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
- It gets bad at the end. - Exactly.

1112
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,540
(It gets bad at the end.)

1113
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,810
Exactly. It gets bad at the end.

1114
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:37,850
At the very end...

1115
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,250
- It gets bad at the end. - Yes, at the end.

1116
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,810
It's okay at first, but it gets bad at the end.

1117
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,310
I chose the wrong number.

1118
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,250
Are you happy with the dessert you chose?

1119
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,950
- Of course. - I'm happy with mine.

1120
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,290
- I'm not that pleased. - Sure.

1121
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,160
The number you wrote down...

1122
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,330
will be your lucky number for the day.

1123
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,620
- This number? - All day long?

1124
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,100
Today, you'll compete...

1125
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,020
- in the Lucky Number Race. - That sounds like fun.

1126
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,100
How will it go?

1127
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,000
As demonstrated, every choice will depend on your lucky number.

1128
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,810
- Really? - That'll be five for me.

1129
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,410
- I like races like this. - My number is three.

1130
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,270
- You'll be split into two teams. - We have the same number.

1131
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,350
- That means we're a team. - The race will end...

1132
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,020
when you arrive at the final destination.

1133
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,870
The first team to get there...

1134
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,640
will be given an additional benefit.

1135
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,120
Maybe I should've chosen a higher number.

1136
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:26,330
The numbers you have will be your pool of lucky numbers.

1137
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,330
One from the bag will be chosen randomly.

1138
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,390
(A number for each team will be chosen randomly.)

1139
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,040
- It'll be chosen randomly. - That's right.

1140
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,500
Let's say one team chose the number three.

1141
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
At a restaurant,

1142
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,470
they'll only get to have the third item on the menu.

1143
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,810
- Or... - So whatever it is...

1144
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,540
If you get on a bus,

1145
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,810
you must get off after three stops.

1146
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,310
If you take a taxi, you must get off after three minutes.

1147
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,410
- Like that... - That sounds like fun.

1148
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,180
It doesn't sound easy though.

1149
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,390
On your way to the final destination,

1150
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,660
each team must complete two missions.

1151
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,700
There are four missions to choose from,

1152
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
but those chosen by the other team won't be available to you.

1153
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,270
You can only travel by bus or cab today,

1154
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,140
but you can't take a cab twice in a row.

1155
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,330
You won't be given a specific meal time,

1156
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,310
so feel free to eat at your discretion.

1157
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,770
I'm glad I got to eat something.

1158
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,910
There's no limit to the budget, so you may have whatever you want.

1159
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,910
- Really? - Yes.

1160
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,450
It won't be pleasing...

1161
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,720
if we have to eat something we don't want.

1162
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,080
- Not at Gimbap Heaven. - Gimbap Heaven!

1163
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,950
- That's right. Gimbap Heaven. - At Gimbap Heaven...

1164
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,250
Before you leave,

1165
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,930
- you'll split into two teams. - Sure.

1166
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:38,390
Since it's the World Cup, we'll decide by drawing names.

1167
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,020
- Sure. - Sounds good.

1168
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,060
(Running Man Draw Ceremony)

1169
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,730
(The solemn process that'll play a huge factor in today's game.)

1170
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,230
Good. Let's do this.

1171
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,080
Here's someone who has...

1172
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,870
- the authority to host this event. - Who is it?

1173
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,770
It'll be our cameraman, Kang Chan Hee.

1174
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,350
- Chan Hee. - It's General Kang.

1175
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,120
He's been at this job since the 80s.

1176
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,290
- Someone with high authority. - On shows that aired in the 80s,

1177
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,750
his name appears at the bottom of the screen.

1178
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,160
The legendary and wealthy Kang Chan Hee.

1179
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,230
The wealthy Kang Chan Hee.

1180
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,870
(He's called rich the second he enters.)

1181
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,020
Kang Chan Hee.

1182
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,870
Out of all the cameramen, he's the wealthiest.

1183
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,140
- The one with neck pain. - He represents.

1184
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,770
We'll choose one for Group A and one for Group B...

1185
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,870
- and so on and so forth. - Sure thing.

1186
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,870
Please choose a member that'll be placed in Group A.

1187
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,370
(Drawing for Group A)

1188
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:32,220
(It's as serious as it was during the World Cup drawing event.)

1189
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,410
He's just going to choose one.

1190
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,660
He's taking his time.

1191
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:40,700
(Why is this nerve-wracking though?)

1192
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,790
(He chose one!)

1193
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,700
He's opening the ball just like they do at the World Cup.

1194
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,200
- This is nerve-wracking. - It's not a ball with a number.

1195
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,770
- There's something inside. - This is like the World Cup.

1196
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,160
He's unfolding it.

1197
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,540
Group A.

1198
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:57,640
- Haha. - Haha.

1199
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,770
Group A.

1200
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,120
Let's now see who's in Group B.

1201
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,350
Since he's a cameraman,

1202
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,310
I thought he'd show it to the camera,

1203
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,620
but he let us see it first.

1204
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,350
- You should get in on camera. - Exactly.

1205
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,350
Why is he showing us first?

1206
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,520
It startled me.

1207
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,060
He's experienced enough to know better.

1208
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,520
- Group B. - Let's see.

1209
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,950
- The wealthy Kang Chan Hee. - Who will compete against Haha?

1210
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,120
Who's in Group B?

1211
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,470
- So Min. - Jeonsobari.

1212
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,430
- The two hipsters. - Trendy versus trendy.

1213
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,870
- What a bummer. - We'll see who's trendier.

1214
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,930
The trend-setters.

1215
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,640
They'll bring vibrant energy.

1216
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,480
- We're back to Group A. - Group A.

1217
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,640
- Good. - Who will be on Haha's team?

1218
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,040
- Even dung... - Let it be me.

1219
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,520
Haha and I will write history today.

1220
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,540
(Group A: Ji Suk Jin)

1221
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,350
- Let's write history. - Nice!

1222
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,230
- Now for Group B. - Jae Suk.

1223
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,620
I love it.

1224
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,560
- They make a good team. - I agree.

1225
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,020
I'm loving it.

1226
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,330
- Right. - Good.

1227
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,700
I guess it's my job...

1228
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,790
to give the hipsters a reality check.

1229
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,540
- The third member of Group A. - Group A.

1230
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,810
- It can be anyone. - Let it be Ji Hyo.

1231
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,000
- I think it's me. - Is it Ji Hyo?

1232
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,500
Is it happening the way I want it to?

1233
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,910
(Song Ji Hyo)

1234
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,080
Suk Jin, what's going on?

1235
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,350
Suk Jin, what's going on? What's with the predictions?

1236
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,350
- No way! - He got it right again.

1237
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,850
Has the AI Octopus replaced him?

1238
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,910
This will be the last member for Group B.

1239
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,620
- It's between me and Se Chan. - Let it be Se Chan.

1240
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,980
Se Chan.

1241
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,160
- Yang Ssaebssaeb! - Are you kidding me?

1242
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,120
- Suk Jin, no way. - I see the future.

1243
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,350
- Am I in Group A? - It was as I called it.

1244
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,520
The groups have been drawn.

1245
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,700
- Let's thank Mr. Kang for... - Thank you!

1246
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,040
- Thank you. - Thanks, Chan Hee.

1247
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,160
- The wealthy Kang Chan Hee. - Yes, the wealthy Mr. Kang.

1248
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,910
Let me first inform you of your final destination.

1249
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,180
- Where are we headed? - Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

1250
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,270
- Apgujeong Rodeo Street? - Yes.

1251
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,000
Apgujeong Rodeo Street?

1252
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,950
- That's your neighborhood. - It's my neighborhood.

1253
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,020
It's like we've already won.

1254
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,640
- It's my neighborhood. - We're closing the show...

1255
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,640
close to his home.

1256
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,790
Your first means of transportation will be the bus.

1257
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,790
- Right. - You will head...

1258
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,410
to the Yeouido Transfer Center which is nearby.

1259
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,620
- Sure. - Got it.

1260
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,620
I haven't been on a bus in a while.

1261
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,620
Me neither.

1262
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,500
- Bus and then a cab. - Bus or cab.

1263
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,700
- Riding a bus - We'll first take the bus.

1264
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,370
- I haven't been here in a while... - But on the bus...

1265
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,500
- So... - I know, right?

1266
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,390
- We should get it out already. - We used to shoot a lot in Yeouido,

1267
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,600
- since the TV stations are nearby. - That's right.

1268
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,700
- It's been a while. - All of the TV stations were here.

1269
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,370
- Of course. - It's a financial district.

1270
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,200
Jong Kook, Jae Suk, me, and Haha...

1271
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,950
- used to hang out in Yeouido. - Yes, we hung out here.

1272
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:15,950
The TV stations were here.

1273
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,450
You filmed a lot in Yeouido too, Ji Hyo.

1274
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,180
- I did. - She must have been here a lot.

1275
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,790
- It's been a while. - Yeouido.

1276
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,950
- Seriously. - The sky is clear today.

1277
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,620
It's been a while. It was supposed to rain a lot today.

1278
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,100
- It's a relief. - It rained a little earlier.

1279
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,330
It's perfect.

1280
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,750
It's NewJeans.

1281
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,870
(The fake NewJeans are back again.)

1282
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:35,930
(Dancing)

1283
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,700
So Min doesn't know.

1284
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,270
So Min.

1285
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:43,200
- She was side-eyeing. - She doesn't know.

1286
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,200
You don't know "Hype Boy?"

1287
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,480
Don't you know "Hype Boy?"

1288
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,850
Is it a new song?

1289
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,810
- He doesn't know. - It's been a while since release.

1290
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,310
"Essential." Which song does that come from?

1291
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,390
Essential?

1292
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,950
(Essential?)

1293
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:58,850
Essential?

1294
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,000
- What's "Essential?" - Amazing.

1295
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,250
- I also know what that is. - "Attention."

1296
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,390
- Don't you know "Hype Boy?" - I don't know.

1297
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,140
Hype boy

1298
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,640
(Hype boy)

1299
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,730
- Hype boy - Hype boy

1300
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,100
That's "My Boy."

1301
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,980
This is how you dance to "Hype Boy."

1302
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,350
(New Thing Boy)

1303
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,770
I'm new, my glasses are new too

1304
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,390
My pants are new too

1305
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,180
This is so funny.

1306
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,120
(Trendy songs are put to death as usual.)

1307
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,390
Attention.

1308
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,330
But So Min's beanie...

1309
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,230
Isn't it cute?

1310
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,020
He says it keeps coming off.

1311
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,770
- He wants it down. - It might fall off.

1312
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,370
It's climbing up your hair.

1313
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,270
You acted like her boyfriend.

1314
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,830
- It's like it's stuck on your hair. - Her boyfriend.

1315
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,410
Pull your beanie down.

1316
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,140
So Min is weird.

1317
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,850
She says she doesn't like Se Chan, but she likes being cared by him.

1318
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,100
It's weird.

1319
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,180
Honestly, when Sae Ho came, Se Chan looked very handsome.

1320
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:59,140
That day,

1321
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,620
- Se Chan was glowing. - The day Sae Ho came?

1322
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,020
Yeouido is really... Look at this building.

1323
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,230
Was it not there when you were around?

1324
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,520
- I'm a big fan. - I think it wasn't there.

1325
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,750
- Pardon? - I'm a big fan.

1326
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,350
- Pardon? - I'm a big fan.

1327
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,770
Of Running Man?

1328
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,430
- Thank you. - I subscribed to your channel.

1329
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,060
You're subscribed to Jiseokjin World?

1330
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,060
Of course.

1331
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:18,000
He's a subscriber.

1332
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,410
(His subscriber bravely came forward!)

1333
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,180
He's a subscriber.

1334
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,000
Thank you.

1335
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,680
- This is funny. - To Kim Jong Kook's too.

1336
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,410
- Gym Jong Kook. - Gym Jong Kook.

1337
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,410
His body says he's a Gym Jong Kook subscriber.

1338
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,520
Your face looks like you're a Jiseokjin World subscriber.

1339
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,850
Don't you have a nickname for your subscribers?

1340
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:35,180
I don't.

1341
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,290
- Thank you. Have a nice day! - Hold on.

1342
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,390
When are we going to ride the bus?

1343
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,430
It's Jidok? I thought you said Jidol.

1344
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,000
- It's Jidok. - I thought the same.

1345
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,730
Catch rats, catch rats, squeak, squeak, squeak

1346
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:46,830
(The major center where many buses in Seoul and Gyeonggi stop by)

1347
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,600
- We'll split into two teams now. - Okay.

1348
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,270
- Come here Hype Boy. - Hype Boy.

1349
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,370
(They will split into two teams from here and begin the match.)

1350
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:54,040
- We're the trend-setters. - That's right.

1351
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,330
- Let's get moving. - Should we walk like this?

1352
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,580
- We can eat whatever we want. - Yes.

1353
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,770
- We should eat something nice. - Let's eat nice food.

1354
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,870
- Like "The Tortoise and the Hare." - "The Tortoise and the Hare?"

1355
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,640
Let's constantly move like the tortoise and then eat.

1356
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,720
Are you hungry now?

1357
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,180
- You're not hungry, right? - I'm not.

1358
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,950
- That's right. What time is it now? - How about around twelve o'clock?

1359
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,290
But you know the places in Apgujeong Rodeo Street.

1360
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,750
Don't worry.

1361
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,230
I know it very well. You don't have to worry.

1362
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:21,160
The problem is that we can eat depending on what number...

1363
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,390
- we pick. - That's right.

1364
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:23,600
I know a good place there.

1365
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,970
I don't think we should choose number one.

1366
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,640
We should go somewhere with less dishes on the menu.

1367
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:28,980
A single-menu restaurant?

1368
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,230
That's right.

1369
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,250
What do you want to eat today?

1370
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,810
We're allowed to eat something expensive.

1371
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:37,540
What's good to eat in the morning?

1372
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,180
- We can eat anything. - Should we eat steak?

1373
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,560
- In the morning? - Yes. Steak in the morning.

1374
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,120
He always eats steak if he's not paying.

1375
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,120
- You always eat that. - Bye.

1376
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,020
- Lamb steak. - Bye!

1377
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,560
- See you later! - See you!

1378
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,560
- Bye! - See you later!

1379
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,660
Where is this going?

1380
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,770
It's going to Lotte World. To Samseong and Gangnam Station.

1381
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,290
- Where? It's going to Gangnam? - This one.

1382
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,730
- It's going to Gangnam Station. - Shall we get on this one?

1383
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,200
- It's coming here. - We don't know how far we'll go.

1384
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,480
Suk Jin.

1385
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,930
- You're going to pick a number now. - Okay.

1386
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:07,250
You'll immediately get on the bus with the number you pick.

1387
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,040
- Okay. - I see.

1388
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,220
So the route we're taking doesn't matter.

1389
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,540
Okay. Got it.

1390
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,790
- Really? - Really?

1391
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,290
Our thoughts don't matter.

1392
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:18,790
- What if we end up somewhere else? - We might do a tour around Seoul.

1393
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:21,060
- Let's try it. - Let's pick one. Go first, So Min.

1394
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,350
- Pick one, So Min. - You go first.

1395
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,200
I'll look up the buses.

1396
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,620
That doesn't matter.

1397
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,700
- The number... - You have to use these numbers.

1398
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,830
- Among those? - Just those?

1399
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,660
- You can pick one. - Which one?

1400
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:34,830
Number three.

1401
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,580
(Team Suk Jin picks a number.)

1402
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,680
I got it.

1403
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,080
We have to ride a bus that includes this number?

1404
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,520
What's this?

1405
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,850
You have to ride a bus that includes eight,

1406
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:46,850
- and get off at the eighth station. - Yes, at the eighth bus station.

1407
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:47,950
Great.

1408
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:48,950
- It's eight. - Eight?

1409
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,220
I have a bad feeling about this.

1410
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,430
- I think this one is good. - Let's see.

1411
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,430
This one.

1412
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,520
- Number eight. - Eight.

1413
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,060
Eight.

1414
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,620
Get on the bus that has eight when it arrives.

1415
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,540
- But there are no buses with 8. - There's one. Bus 8000.

1416
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,500
- Isn't that a wide-area bus? - We're in trouble.

1417
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,160
What about Bus 6628?

1418
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,600
- Bus 6628? - That works.

1419
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,600
(Fortunately, there's a bus number that includes 8.)

1420
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:10,180
So we have to get on this bus.

1421
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,480
We can't ride this bus.

1422
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,270
We have to go very far if we get on this bus.

1423
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,950
- It's the red bus. - Shall we go to Mok-dong?

1424
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,080
(There are wide-area buses that have 8 in their numbers.)

1425
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,950
We can go this way to Yeouido Park.

1426
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:21,390
- Are we going this way? - No.

1427
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,060
- Is it going in this direction? - I think so.

1428
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,580
This bus goes in this direction.

1429
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,950
Then does it go in circles?

1430
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,500
No.

1431
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,330
Does the bus go around like this?

1432
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,830
Is it a circulating bus?

1433
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,470
(They're having difficulties already.)

1434
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,160
- There's 8 here. Bus 8600. - There's Bus 88.

1435
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,430
Bus 8600.

1436
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,330
- Bus 8601. - It's going to the city hall.

1437
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,870
Bus 8601.

1438
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,330
- Bus 8500. - Let's see.

1439
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,350
- One, two, three, four, five, six, - I should put my mask on.

1440
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,040
seven, eight. It's Janggi Station.

1441
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,750
It's going to Janggi Station?

1442
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:50,520
- We can't go there. - Then we shouldn't get on this bus.

1443
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,750
- Let's not ride this bus... - But we have to if it comes.

1444
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,080
- We have to ride it if it comes. - That's the only bus here.

1445
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,660
- Let's just ride the bus. - Yes.

1446
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,020
There's nothing we can do.

1447
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,250
It's Bus 8601.

1448
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,520
- Bus 8601. - It goes to Mapo Station.

1449
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,430
- We won this race. - Let's go to the second floor.

1450
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:05,500
Let's go to the second floor.

1451
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,870
Shall we? I've never ridden a double-decker bus.

1452
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:11,540
A bus with eight in its number is approaching. You can get on it.

1453
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,270
- We have to get on it? - We can't get on the bus we want.

1454
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:15,680
We can't ride this one.

1455
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,700
Isn't this a wide-area bus?

1456
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,200
This is a wide-area bus.

1457
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,540
Is it not?

1458
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,370
But the bus route is a little...

1459
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,580
Hello.

1460
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,850
- Three people, please. - Three people, please.

1461
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,040
- Three people? - Yes.

1462
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,390
Do you want to go upstairs?

1463
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:29,850
Upstairs? Should we go upstairs?

1464
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,250
We have to get off at the eighth station.

1465
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:34,230
- I've never ridden a double-decker. - Me too.

1466
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,790
- Hello. - Hello.

1467
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,890
The back doesn't have it.

1468
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,700
- We have to put on the belt, right? - We don't know the direction.

1469
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,700
You have to put on the belt everywhere.

1470
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,040
We have to get off at the eighth station, right?

1471
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,470
Yes.

1472
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,080
- Eight stations? - I'll look at the map...

1473
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,350
when the bus stops.

1474
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,000
- This station... - Okay. Hold on.

1475
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,580
(Is it heading to Seoul or the opposite direction?)

1476
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,010
- This stop... - Okay. Hold on.

1477
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,150
- is Mapo Station. - This is the first stop.

1478
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,840
We reach Mapo Station within one stop.

1479
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,170
We're at Mapo Station.

1480
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,840
- This is great. - It's great.

1481
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,610
- This is... - What will we eat, Ji Hyo?

1482
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:20,010
This bus is going to Seoul Station.

1483
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,510
Seoul Station is also nice.

1484
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,650
- It's not bad. - Seoul Station is...

1485
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,130
The area is nice. It has lots of good restaurants.

1486
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,990
We can ride a taxi to the bus stop.

1487
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,070
We can ride this...

1488
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,360
- We can ride another bus there. - That's right.

1489
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,990
Then ride another taxi.

1490
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:36,800
Number eight is good. It's a great number.

1491
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,400
- Eight is... - We picked a good number.

1492
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,070
- Eight is a great number. - It's amazing.

1493
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,110
(It really became a lucky number.)

1494
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:44,010
- I've never ridden a double-decker. - Me too. It's high up here.

1495
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,710
Where are we?

1496
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,110
Us?

1497
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,880
We should get off at the eighth stop.

1498
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,190
We're at Yeouido Interchange.

1499
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,190
What's the eighth stop?

1500
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,110
Janggi High School?

1501
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,420
Isn't that in Gimpo?

1502
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,050
- Janggi-dong is in Gimpo. - We're in trouble.

1503
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,260
Isn't that in Gimpo?

1504
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,260
(It's a bus heading to Gimpo.)

1505
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,820
Why did we pick number eight?

1506
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,940
I said number eight could be good.

1507
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,400
- This is a red bus. - We're doomed.

1508
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,740
Is this a wide-area bus?

1509
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,340
If the bus takes the highway, we could end up in Gyeonggi-do.

1510
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:19,940
It's past the rush hour, so there aren't many passengers.

1511
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,690
Or else, there would have been many passengers.

1512
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,490
- This is really... - We could go to Seoul Station.

1513
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,780
- Seoul Station is good. - It's not bad.

1514
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,150
It's way closer to Gangnam.

1515
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:30,530
(Same number, same bus, but opposite fates of the two teams)

1516
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,380
Where are we going now?

1517
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,650
Does this bus not stop?

1518
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,820
Why does it not stop?

1519
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,490
- If it goes eight stops... - Where will we end up in?

1520
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,490
We'll end up at the end of Gimpo.

1521
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,360
Our PD is also flustered.

1522
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,630
If the bus stopped at the stops, we wouldn't be going to Gimpo.

1523
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,070
- That's right. - If we count the eight stops.

1524
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:53,010
I took a wrong bus in Hongdae once, and I was in Gimpo after one stop.

1525
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,650
Really? I guess it was a bus like this.

1526
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:58,150
In my teenage years, I would ride buses a lot...

1527
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,420
to calm my mind.

1528
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,110
Back then, I got on a bus like this one.

1529
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,990
- You did it on purpose. - I listened to music.

1530
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,220
You listened to the mymy cassette player.

1531
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,220
I listened to the mymy all day long.

1532
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,860
(Today)

1533
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,360
(At a place)

1534
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:13,630
That's depressing.

1535
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:14,740
(No one passed by)

1536
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,360
(This sad song helped him breathe when he was going through puberty.)

1537
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,440
- How much did you have then? - I listened to Lee Seung Chul.

1538
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,440
- Two dollars. - That's sad.

1539
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,550
Back in high school,

1540
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:26,720
"Road" by god made me shed tears.

1541
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,780
"Road."

1542
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,220
- It was my birthday. Yes. - Where will this road take me?

1543
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,920
I cried every time I listened to it. The lyrics were so fitting.

1544
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,360
Now, we are traveling aimlessly.

1545
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,360
- This is bad. - We are traveling aimlessly.

1546
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,530
This is fun when you are dating someone.

1547
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:40,220
- A bus trip. - You set off aimlessly.

1548
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,090
- That's right. - "Let's run away."

1549
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,820
(Eloping in a wide-area bus)

1550
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,530
The family should be against the relationship then.

1551
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,030
It should be a difficult love.

1552
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,610
It can't be smooth.

1553
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,940
On the second floor...

1554
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,240
- of the empty bus, - The second floor.

1555
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,400
- you will hold hands. - You will sit at the end.

1556
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,610
That's right. You will sit at the end.

1557
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,780
You would kiss your lover if there is no one around, right?

1558
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,050
No. Instead...

1559
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,720
(He suddenly asks a question about kissing.)

1560
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,150
You would share earphones.

1561
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,420
I think you would kiss your lover.

1562
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,490
No.

1563
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,090
If it's difficult love, you stare at each other sadly.

1564
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,630
- Really? - Yes.

1565
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,420
- There is no physical contact. - You would hold hands.

1566
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,690
- You would hold hands. - Wouldn't you kiss though?

1567
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,070
Jae Suk, why would you kiss on the bus?

1568
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:22,090
It would be a peck on the forehead.

1569
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:25,030
- A peck. - Yes. Then a peck on the nose.

1570
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,170
Nose?

1571
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:30,650
You should wet your lover's nose a little.

1572
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,670
- It would smell like spit. - Not the nose.

1573
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,670
Why would it smell like spit when it's only a peck?

1574
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,590
- Se Chan has thick lips. - Yes, I do.

1575
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,990
- Why are you thinking about him? - Seriously.

1576
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:42,150
- For goodness' sake. - That's funny.

1577
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,130
We finally arrived at the first bus stop.

1578
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:46,820
This is driving me crazy.

1579
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,530
- This is insane. - Where are we?

1580
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,900
- Yeongdeungpo. - Dangsan Station.

1581
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,630
- Dangsan. - Dangsan?

1582
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,900
- We will end up in Gimpo. - This is bad.

1583
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,360
At this rate, we will fall way behind.

1584
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:59,630
I am sure the other team had complications too.

1585
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,940
Of course.

1586
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:04,470
We are passing the Mapo Bridge in a single stop.

1587
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,650
Which stop is it? Is this the 3rd or the 4th stop?

1588
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,920
Which stop is it?

1589
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,110
We didn't hear the announcement yet. Here it comes.

1590
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,220
- This stop is... - The third stop.

1591
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,720
- Chungjeongno Station. - The third stop.

1592
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,610
Chungjeongno Station. We are almost there.

1593
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,050
- Chungjeongno Station. - We reached Chungjeongno Station.

1594
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,530
- We are almost done. - I think things are going well.

1595
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,150
- I think we made the right call. - I agree.

1596
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,400
- Had we gotten off... - Yes.

1597
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,130
Did "Mom's Diary" film the match against Uruguay?

1598
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:24,490
- Yes. - When does it air?

1599
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,590
I am not sure. I will have to ask.

1600
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:28,860
- Don't you know? - I don't know.

1601
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,030
"How Do You Play?" filmed the match against Uruguay.

1602
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,610
- It aired. - Yes. It aired already.

1603
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,300
Shouldn't you focus on your show?

1604
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,210
It's good to have you back, Jong Kook.

1605
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,670
I missed that kind of comment.

1606
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,070
- It has been a while, right? - It just came out.

1607
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:42,420
- I... - You forgot to be nice.

1608
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,510
It just came out.

1609
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,420
- I suppressed myself, - You couldn't change your ways.

1610
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,220
but it just came out.

1611
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,590
It came out since it was a habit. For goodness' sake.

1612
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,030
It just came out.

1613
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:53,090
I was annoyed by his words.

1614
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,590
But I also felt glad.

1615
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,220
- Seriously. - I felt the same.

1616
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,630
- He is better that way. - I agree.

1617
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,970
That was great.

1618
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,800
We are at the City Hall.

1619
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,530
The City Hall? Which stop is it?

1620
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,240
This is the seventh stop.

1621
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,800
The seventh stop? This is great.

1622
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,900
There is a lot to eat here.

1623
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,940
The seventh stop? Do we get off at the next stop?

1624
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,900
- We get off at the next stop. - That sounds great.

1625
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,670
I want a burger too.

1626
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,150
- A burger? - Anything would be tasty.

1627
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,780
Yes. We should eat something nutritious.

1628
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,780
That sounds great.

1629
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,880
It might be better to go to a snack food place.

1630
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,490
Let's go to a nice restaurant. The production crew is paying.

1631
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:24,220
- If we end up... - To be honest,

1632
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,530
the production crew should buy us meat.

1633
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,530
- But... - SBS should do that.

1634
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:30,720
Ji Hyo suggested a snack food place because there would be...

1635
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,030
- a long menu. - I mean...

1636
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,840
We would be less likely to fail.

1637
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,470
- That's right. - We wouldn't eat something bad.

1638
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,030
What if we end up getting soju?

1639
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,130
I would be thankful.

1640
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,340
- No way. - I would be thankful.

1641
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:43,070
That wouldn't count. We can't drink soju on the show.

1642
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,880
- We can't drink soju. - You have to drink it.

1643
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,570
- Really? - Yes. You have to drink it.

1644
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,670
- Really? Would SBS be okay? - Yes.

1645
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,010
- I... - We need to get ready to get off.

1646
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,220
Let's eat here and take a cab...

1647
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,690
to go to Hannam-dong.

1648
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,260
Let's do that.

1649
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,530
Eight minutes should be enough, right?

1650
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,800
- Take the Namsan Third Tunnel. - This stop is...

1651
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,720
- Chungjeongno Station. - Chungjeongno Station.

1652
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,900
- The next station is... - We get off here, right?

1653
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,070
Gongdeok Station.

1654
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:06,530
- Don't we need to get off? - We need to get off.

1655
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,860
- Let's wait by the door. - Let's go.

1656
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,110
- Have a nice day. - Thank you.

1657
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,340
- We are here. - Thank you.

1658
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,010
- Didn't we pick the perfect number? - Sir, please hold on.

1659
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,970
- Thank you. - We picked the perfect number.

1660
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:18,440
Thank goodness we picked eight.

1661
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,880
You can move, eat, or complete a mission.

1662
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,240
- Shall we eat here? - Sure.

1663
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,610
Let's go on an 8-minute taxi ride first.

1664
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,740
Shall we do that? Let's eat there.

1665
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,880
- We don't know this place. - Okay.

1666
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,380
- Hold on. Where are we? - We need to cross the road.

1667
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,860
Gangnam is that way.

1668
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,990
- Wangsimni. You are right. - It's that way.

1669
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,260
- Let's cross the road. - Let's cross the road.

1670
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,400
- The crosswalk is over there. - It's over there.

1671
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,030
Let's take a taxi here.

1672
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,320
We will travel for eight minutes.

1673
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,170
We won't have enough screen time. We are nearly done.

1674
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,130
- It's okay. - Crew, would you be okay?

1675
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,710
We are moving so fast. Would you be okay?

1676
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:49,240
If we take a taxi back to the City Hall area,

1677
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,210
there will be many buses that head to Gangnam.

1678
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,420
That's right. The weather is perfect for the shoot.

1679
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,010
- Look at that. - The light changed right away.

1680
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,920
- What timing. - The light changed right away.

1681
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,090
That was incredible.

1682
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,860
- It changed right away. - We didn't even need to wait.

1683
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,720
This is insane.

1684
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,920
Wangsimni. Will we be able to hail a taxi?

1685
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,130
- We need to go toward Gangnam. - We can ride it for eight minutes,

1686
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:09,130
so let's ask the driver to get close to Gangnam.

1687
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:10,860
- We need to get close to Gangnam. - Okay.

1688
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,420
- Exactly 8 minutes. - Exactly 8 minutes.

1689
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,360
We will set the timer on the phone.

1690
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,170
- Really? - When eight minutes are up,

1691
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,240
get off the taxi.

1692
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,030
- It's here. - How will you follow us?

1693
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,740
(A taxi passes by!)

1694
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,010
It's here. Let's get in.

1695
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:25,210
- Hello. - Hello.

1696
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,050
- You can take the passenger seat. - Okay. Thank you.

1697
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,440
Call us.

1698
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,420
After eight minutes...

1699
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,610
Get in.

1700
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:34,110
- Set the timer. - I will set the timer.

1701
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:37,090
Please go near Gangnam as much as possible.

1702
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,090
Please go near Gangnam.

1703
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,990
We need to take a bus afterward.

1704
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,630
- You know... - This is Nanji Hangang Park.

1705
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:46,030
Nanji Hangang Park. I thought this bus would stop.

1706
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:47,360
- It isn't stopping at all. - It isn't stopping at all.

1707
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,300
This bus is taking the Olympic-daero.

1708
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,630
This is driving me crazy. What should we do?

1709
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,470
- Hey, this is... - Jae Suk.

1710
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,800
This bus isn't stopping at all.

1711
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,110
This is driving me crazy.

1712
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,110
What do we do now?

1713
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:04,010
At Gimpo, we need to take the same bus back.

1714
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,110
The round trip will take two hours.

1715
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,990
- This is bad. - Our destination is Apgujeong,

1716
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:11,050
but we are going in the opposite direction.

1717
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,530
- This is bad. - We need to strategize well.

1718
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,630
After we take the same bus back,

1719
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,530
we can ride a taxi for eight minutes...

1720
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,860
toward Apgujeong.

1721
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,760
We can ride a taxi for eight minutes.

1722
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,070
It isn't so bad since there is no traffic.

1723
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,300
- I know. - It feels nice...

1724
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,530
- since we are going fast. - That's right.

1725
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,050
It feels nice since it isn't suffocating.

1726
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,010
If I don't think of it as a shoot, it's very nice.

1727
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,510
If I don't think of it as a game, it's very nice.

1728
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,970
- It's a shoot. - It's a shoot.

1729
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:37,050
Right.

1730
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,240
I am riding a bus with you and Se Chan.

1731
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,490
That's right.

1732
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,720
Where are we going right now?

1733
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,320
Jae Suk, isn't that a cruise ship?

1734
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,360
What's that?

1735
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,420
- Jae Suk, we need to go... - We are in Gimpo.

1736
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,820
to Gangnam. But we are seeing ferries.

1737
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,420
Hold on. Isn't that the outlet?

1738
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,490
The outlet in Gimpo?

1739
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:58,110
- You are right. - Hyundai Premium Outlet Gimpo.

1740
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:59,340
Look outside the window.

1741
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,340
(When they look outside the window)

1742
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,740
It's pretty.

1743
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,780
Where are we going?

1744
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:07,720
Where are we? What is this place?

1745
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,320
I am seeing barbed wire fences.

1746
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,090
(It's a view they didn't expect to see today.)

1747
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:16,490
Why does this always happen to me?

1748
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,720
- You are unlucky. - I am serious.

59:59,269 --> 01:00:00,570
I have no luck...

1749
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,320
- in this kind of game. - Seriously.

1750
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,720
- I am like that. - I am like that too.

1751
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,170
And the two of us teamed up.

1752
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,900
Seriously. I have no luck.

1753
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,260
I wonder where Suk Jin's team went.

1754
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:33,380
- Suk Jin's team... - I bet they are struggling too.

1755
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,380
I know.

1756
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,610
Sir, thank you much for your cooperation.

1757
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,240
Thank you.

1758
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,720
How far can we go in eight minutes?

1759
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,840
In eight minutes, you can reach Myeongdong.

1760
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,420
- Myeongdong. - Myeongdong.

1761
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,820
There is a lot to eat in Myeongdong.

1762
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,990
Myeongdong would be a good place.

1763
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,320
It would be a good place indeed.

1764
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,920
All right.

1765
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,820
Now, 42 seconds remain.

1766
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:57,690
Hello, sir. Do you know who I am?

1767
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,590
Not really. I don't know.

1768
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,840
It's okay.

1769
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,170
You don't know who we are.

1770
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,240
- The woman in the back is... - Who is she?

1771
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,800
Kim... Song Ji Hyo.

1772
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,110
Yes, I am. Hello.

1773
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:11,970
All of you are famous.

1774
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:15,010
Yes. You know who he is, right?

1775
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:16,880
Who is he?

1776
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:20,610
My goodness.

1777
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:24,490
(Haha)

1778
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:25,880
What could his name be?

1779
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,150
(Haha)

1780
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,800
Is he Haha?

1781
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,990
- Yes. - You know.

1782
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:36,090
Do you know the TV show, Running Man?

1783
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:38,440
- I watch it often. - Do you watch it often?

1784
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,740
It's on every time I turn on the TV.

1785
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,210
Thank you.

1786
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,110
- Where is that member? - Who?

1787
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,880
- Yoo Jae Suk? - Yoo Jae Suk.

1788
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,220
- Yoo Jae Suk. - He took a different vehicle.

1789
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:48,420
He is in a different team.

1790
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,320
I see. Is he in a different team?

1791
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,820
- Yes. - Yes.

1792
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:56,010
If you have any dissatisfaction regarding Jae Suk,

1793
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,050
- please tell me. - That's a good one.

1794
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:59,320
(Reporter Ji tries to get him to badmouth Jae Suk.)

1795
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,630
That's a good one, Suk Jin.

1796
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,190
- Regarding Jae Suk? - Yes.

1797
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,170
Is there anything he should fix?

1798
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:07,590
- There is nothing he should fix. - Okay.

1799
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:12,740
How is he so popular when he isn't that handsome?

1800
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,340
(The driver makes a loaded comment.)

1801
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,670
- That was what we wanted to say. - That's a fact.

1802
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,050
How is he so popular...

1803
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,710
- when he isn't that handsome? - Seriously.

1804
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:22,070
He made a funny comment.

1805
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,780
Now, 6 minutes and 45 seconds have passed.

1806
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,590
Eight minutes haven't passed yet.

1807
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:27,490
Will we reach Myeongdong?

1808
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,260
- Myeongdong. - Myeongdong Station.

1809
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,630
- Myeongdong Station. - That would be the best.

1810
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:33,690
This is bad.

1811
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,690
- We should get off here. - It's over there.

1812
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,970
- Please pull up here. - How much time remains?

1813
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:37,970
Over there?

1814
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,420
- Yes. - Fifty-eight, fifty-nine.

1815
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,690
- Time's up. - Time's up.

1816
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:47,030
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1817
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:49,400
- Have a nice day. - Bye.

1818
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,570
My goodness.

1819
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,510
We are here.

1820
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,010
Have a nice day.

1821
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,110
Thank you.

1822
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,720
- Film this. - We should wait here.

1823
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,110
- The timer. - We got off exactly on time.

1824
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,960
- It was perfect. - It counts, right?

1825
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,990
(Suk Jin films things without being asked.)

1826
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:02,420
This doesn't blink.

1827
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:04,550
There are no staff members.

1828
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,590
(The staff members are coming in a different vehicle.)

1829
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,420
We should tell them that we are at the Shinsegae Department Store.

1830
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,260
- I will call them. - Will you do that?

1831
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,220
- My goodness. - This is funny.

1832
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,940
- It's funny that they aren't here. - I know. They aren't here.

1833
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,860
It's no wonder they gave us this camera.

1834
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,610
I see a samgyetang restaurant,

1835
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:20,030
but it's closed.

1836
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,240
- I really want to eat samgyetang. - I am hungry.

1837
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,940
- How about a Chinese restaurant? - A Chinese restaurant?

1838
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,050
A Chinese restaurant would be nice.

1839
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,280
- The 8th dish wouldn't be bad... - The 8th dish.

1840
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,440
- at a Chinese restaurant. - It would be nice.

1841
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,590
It wouldn't be bad. That's a good idea.

1842
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:32,720
A Chinese restaurant.

1843
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,550
Is the camera working?

1844
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,050
- Yes. - How do I know? Is it working?

1845
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,490
- Press this. - It's filming properly.

1846
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:41,050
- Is it filming properly? - Let's film each other.

1847
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,150
Right now...

1848
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,360
(They agree to film each other.)

1849
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,420
We are in front of the Shinsegae Department Store.

1850
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,740
- We will totally win. - We got stranded.

1851
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,110
Where should we go?

1852
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,760
The staff members aren't here yet.

1853
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,240
It's Haha.

1854
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,900
- They should give us time. - It's Ji Hyo.

1855
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,300
It's Haha.

1856
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,280
- It's Suk Jin. - People think we are being weird.

1857
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,510
(People think we are being weird.)

1858
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,380
- It's Suk Jin. - Seriously.

1859
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,240
What should we do? Should we walk for a while?

1860
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:07,110
(They play with the camera.)

1861
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,360
There you go.

1862
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,420
Which direction should we take?

1863
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,530
- Is Gangnam that way? - It's that way.

1864
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:13,900
- It's that way. - That way?

1865
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,460
What happens if we take a bus here?

1866
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:18,970
- There it is. - Does it go to Gangnam?

1867
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:20,090
There is no eight.

1868
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,800
- There is no eight. - Sorry.

1869
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,990
- There is no eight. - Hold on.

1870
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,530
- Where does this go? Cheongdam? - Apgujeong?

1871
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,300
- It goes to Apgujeong Rodeo. - Apgujeong Rodeo.

1872
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,630
- We need 1, 4, or 3. - We need 1, 4, or 3.

1873
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:30,340
- One, four, or three. - It goes to Apgujeong Rodeo.

1874
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,050
- Let's pick the number again. - But...

1875
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:33,380
- it will be dangerous. - Here is the important thing.

1876
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,380
- Why? - There are many buses...

1877
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,340
which go that way.

1878
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:40,420
We need to go over there so that we don't end up...

1879
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,720
- in a different place. - Shall we do that?

1880
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,320
- That's right. - Let's study the route.

1881
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,380
- Listen. - Apgujeong Rodeo.

1882
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,760
- It's not like that. - Here.

1883
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,320
- You are right. - It isn't the solution.

1884
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,690
- Listen. - Four or three.

1885
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,820
- We just need to pick 1, 4, or 3. - Listen.

1886
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,820
If we pick one.

1887
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:54,800
- we get off after 1 stop. - We get off after 1 stop.

1888
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:58,030
That's why we can't get on this bus.

1889
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,760
We will need to get off...

1890
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,400
- after 3 or 4 stops. - You are right.

1891
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,110
- You are smart. - Thus,

1892
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:05,440
- it's better to go over there. - Listen.

1893
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,220
There is a Chinese restaurant across the street.

1894
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,610
Shall we go to that Chinese restaurant?

1895
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,740
- Let's go. Let's cross the road. - Let's eat.

1896
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,220
- Let's eat. We are hungry. - Let's eat.

1897
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,880
(They suddenly decide to eat.)

1898
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,380
It's the stop.

1899
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,880
- We are finally getting off. - We are getting off.

1900
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,260
Let's get off.

1901
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,030
Let's get off.

1902
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,670
Sir, have a nice day.

1903
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,900
- Okay. - We finally got off.

1904
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,990
We need to go over there.

1905
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,630
Over there.

1906
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,030
Where are we?

1907
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:31,210
Gimpo.

1908
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,940
Should we take a taxi or a bus?

1909
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,380
- Let's take a taxi. - Let's travel for eight minutes.

1910
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,630
Okay. Let's travel for eight minutes.

1911
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,380
- Where are we? - Gimpo.

1912
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:39,110
Let's do a mission.

1913
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:40,570
- What would we do here? - What's here?

1914
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,650
- A mission? - Let's do one.

1915
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,690
- Let's do a mission. - A mission.

1916
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,280
- Let's go inside. - Let's go.

1917
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,150
We came a long way.

1918
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:49,990
I feel like I am dreaming.

1919
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,630
- We are suddenly in Gimpo. - You know,

1920
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:54,420
I think I will remember the bus ride for a long time.

1921
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,170
Where on earth are we?

1922
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,970
Let's pick a mission.

1923
01:05:58,970 --> 01:05:59,970
(Team Jae Suk picks a mission.)

1924
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:01,090
Go ahead.

1925
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,470
- I won't pick it. - I will pick it.

1926
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:03,900
- I can't do it. - I will pick it.

1927
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:05,070
I am scared.

1928
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,510
There are four. It's this one.

1929
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:11,240
I don't know if we will be able to go to Apgujeong.

1930
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,340
Here.

1931
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,740
(Team Jae Suk decides to do one of the two missions.)

1932
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,320
What is it?

1933
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,050
- The mission. - The mission.

1934
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:19,420
- "Get your eyelashes..." - "Get your eyelashes permed?"

1935
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,420
(Mission 1: Get your eyelashes permed.)

1936
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,780
You need to perm your own eyelashes.

1937
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,490
- Do you mean our eyelashes? - Yes.

1938
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:26,990
How do you do that?

1939
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,590
You put on formula here...

1940
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:29,820
- to get them permed. - Really?

1941
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,090
- Then they get curled. - Once you do it,

1942
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,470
- you will look annoying. - The eyelashes get curled.

1943
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:34,630
Jae Suk.

1944
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:36,860
When was it? A hairdresser permed my eyelashes one time...

1945
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,300
since they were long.

1946
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,440
- I thought I looked so annoying. - Afterward,

1947
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,380
your eyelashes will look like this.

1948
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:43,570
So Min looks cute,

1949
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:45,010
but if you and I get them done...

1950
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,380
- Eyelashes. - You will look like this.

1951
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,740
- You will look like this. - My eyelashes will be curled.

1952
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,840
Like this.

1953
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,420
My eyelashes will be like this.

1954
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,320
- Blink. - We need to do it on eight eyes.

1955
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,260
- Since your number is eight, - Yes.

1956
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:57,280
you need to do it on eight eyes.

1957
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,650
There are only six eyes.

1958
01:06:58,650 --> 01:06:59,960
Shall we pick the number again?

1959
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,400
Will you pick the number again?

1960
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,220
Then we won't be able to go back.

1961
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,900
- We need number eight. - You can pick it again.

1962
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,260
Really?

1963
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:08,470
It's raining. This is bad. What should we do?

1964
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:09,900
- It's raining. - My goodness.

1965
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,360
- Let's take cover. Come here. - What are we going to do?

1966
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,170
- It's a rain shower. Run. - What are we going to do?

1967
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,340
(The rain shower falls.)

1968
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,510
Run!

1969
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,570
- What are we going to do? - The bus stop.

1970
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:21,470
(The sky is shedding tears on the unfortunate Team Jae Suk.)

1971
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,590
(An unexpected race)

1972
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:24,690
- Whose fault is this? - This is...

1973
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:27,090
- Hey. - Who is the unlucky one?

1974
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:29,690
- Is it you, Jae Suk? Is it you? - Hold on.

1975
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:32,360
- This is bad. - It's raining so hard. Oh, no.

1976
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,900
We don't even have an umbrella.

1977
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,630
What are we going to do?

1978
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,990
I didn't think it would rain, but it suddenly began to pour down.

1979
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,820
Hey.

1980
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,170
(Dazed)

1981
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,400
We are in trouble today.

1982
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:46,130
- What are we going to do? - It's raining hard.

1983
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,740
- It's raining so hard. - How do we perm our eyelashes?

1984
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:51,280
I will pick a new one.

1985
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:53,440
Pick a new lucky number.

1986
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,440
(Team Jae Suk picks a new lucky number.)

1987
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,740
Are we picking a new number?

1988
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,880
It will take too long to work on eight eyes.

1989
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,920
- One would be the best option. - Let's work on one person.

1990
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,690
- It's 1. - It's 1.

1991
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:06,590
Who will get an eyelash perm?

1992
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,860
- Me? - Your eyelashes are the longest.

1993
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,990
- One person. - Sit down.

1994
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:12,030
(They do the mission on Se Chan's one eye.)

1995
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:13,670
- You know how to do it, right? - You have long eyelashes.

1996
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:14,970
I have long eyelashes.

1997
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,010
We don't have much time.

1998
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,400
- We need to work fast and leave. - Let's work fast.

1999
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,900
We need to work fast and leave.

2000
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,340
All right.

2001
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,780
- Close your eyes. - Okay.

2002
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,720
I need to do this first.

2003
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:32,090
- Keep tilting your head back. - This is hard.

2004
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:34,860
I will apply this next.

2005
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:37,630
- Jae Suk, is she doing it right? - I don't know.

2006
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,230
- No! - What are you doing?

2007
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:43,800
- No! - What are you doing?

2008
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,990
What are you doing?

2009
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,800
What are you doing to my eyes?

2010
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:51,140
- I stick the eyelashes on it. - That's right.

2011
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,100
- My goodness. - If you open your eyes...

2012
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,430
- It's not working. - I opened them slightly.

2013
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,900
Is it working? I don't think it's working.

2014
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:59,570
They are long. They are sticking.

2015
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,070
- They are long. - This is suffocating.

2016
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,440
No. Hang in there.

2017
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,890
- Wait. - They are sticking.

2018
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,020
- Let's stick them. - They are sticking.

2019
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:07,280
- You know... - Do I look cute?

2020
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,520
- Cute? - I will apply a coat. Wait.

2021
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,760
I wouldn't say that you look cute.

2022
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,280
- You look a bit annoying. - Right?

2023
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:13,690
We don't have much time.

2024
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:14,690
(Se Chan became annoying in no time.)

2025
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,130
When will we complete the mission?

2026
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:17,520
We have another mission,

2027
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,190
- right? - So Min, when will this end?

2028
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,730
Jae Suk, shall we go to the bus stop on the other side?

2029
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:23,100
- Let's go. - You can do it on the bus.

2030
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,400
- Let's go. - Can you go with your eyes closed?

2031
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,900
- You can't open your eyes. - Okay.

2032
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,640
- I can go. Ready? - Don't open your eyes.

2033
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,210
You look annoying already.

2034
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,640
- The crosswalk was over there. - I hope it doesn't fall off.

2035
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,880
Come this way. Let's go.

2036
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,610
(While Team Jae Suk is stranded in Gimpo)

2037
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,390
- Let's walk a bit more. - Let's go.

2038
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,650
Let's eat something tasty.

2039
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:45,060
- That sounds great. - We are moving quite fast.

2040
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:46,930
There are a lot of tasty restaurants here.

2041
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,020
(There are a lot of tasty restaurants here!)

2042
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,960
We have a lot of time.

2043
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,520
That's right. Let's walk.

2044
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,300
We don't walk much.

2045
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,970
- When would we come to Myeongdong? - Seriously.

2046
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:58,510
There is no way they will be faster than us.

2047
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,270
- That's right. We did well. - We took the shortest route.

2048
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,100
- Thank goodness we picked eight. - I know.

2049
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,600
Thanks to that, we came here directly.

2050
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:07,110
- Let's pick a restaurant. - A good restaurant.

2051
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:08,880
- A samgyetang restaurant. - There is mala hot pot too.

2052
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,070
Hello.

2053
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,420
- There is a bulgogi restaurant. - Bulgogi.

2054
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:14,610
- It looks nice. - How about this restaurant?

2055
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,980
- How about bulgogi? - Let's eat it.

2056
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:17,930
There is a galbi restaurant too.

2057
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,390
No. The bulgogi restaurant...

2058
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:20,850
- seems to have a lot on the menu. - Listen.

2059
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,190
- There is a lot on the menu. - The bulgogi restaurant it is.

2060
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:23,490
There is a lot on the menu.

2061
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,230
- It seems that way. - There is a lot on the menu.

2062
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,270
The eighth item could be...

2063
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:29,890
- a mushroom dish. - That would be really annoying.

2064
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,510
Let's go inside.

2065
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:33,900
I hope we get the ribs.

2066
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,210
- Japchae sounds delicious. - Ribs.

2067
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,710
- That's right. - We didn't receive permission.

2068
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,380
- We didn't receive permission. - Okay.

2069
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,010
- Ask them. - I will ask them.

2070
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,070
If they don't allow filming, it can't be helped.

2071
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,780
Excuse me.

2072
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:48,220
Would it be okay if we film while having a meal?

2073
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,020
- You can't do it now. - We can't do it now. Okay.

2074
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,180
- It isn't allowed. - It isn't allowed.

2075
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,520
- It isn't allowed. - We can't do it now,

2076
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,890
so we will go to a different restaurant.

2077
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,670
(They run into an unexpected problem.)

2078
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,820
Shall we go here?

2079
01:10:58,890 --> 01:10:59,970
That's a good idea.

2080
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:01,100
- Here. - Let's go.

2081
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,530
They have the Iberico pork neck.

2082
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:03,640
This is a good restaurant.

2083
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,900
Ask the owner.

2084
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:07,900
Sir, do you allow filming in the restaurant?

2085
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,310
- What do you want to film? - We want to film ourselves eating.

2086
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,550
- You are Ji Suk Jin. - Yes.

2087
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:13,550
- Go ahead. - Okay.

2088
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:15,920
- Do you allow it? Thank you. - The restaurant is busy.

2089
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,780
- Thank you. - Let's go to the end.

2090
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,090
We need to eat the eighth item on the menu.

2091
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,650
(What will be the 8th item on the menu?)

2092
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:23,980
It depends on the menu.

2093
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:27,560
- Not bad. - The menu from the owner.

2094
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,630
The menu from the owner? Okay.

2095
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,170
Sir, please give us the menu.

2096
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:34,390
The menu. I am so nervous.

2097
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:37,270
- I am so nervous. - I am thankful he allowed filming.

2098
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:38,360
(Will number 8 bring them luck this time as well?)

2099
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,510
Please let it be something nice.

2100
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:41,710
Please.

2101
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:43,530
- This restaurant... - Meat.

2102
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,010
It might be meat.

2103
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:49,310
- Korean beef. - It will make me go insane.

2104
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:50,350
We picked a pretty good restaurant.

2105
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:52,110
Wouldn't Korean beef be the first item?

2106
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:53,980
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2107
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,350
- You are Kim Jong Kook. - Yes.

2108
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,350
Do we go from the very front page?

2109
01:11:57,350 --> 01:12:00,260
You will pick a page at random.

2110
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:01,490
Really?

2111
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,630
- At random? - Pick a page at the front.

2112
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:04,230
The drinks are toward the end, so pick a page at the front.

2113
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:05,670
- The front. - Yes. Pick a page at the front.

2114
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,060
- Meat dishes are at the front. - Yes.

2115
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,230
- Rice dishes are toward the end. - Rice dishes.

2116
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:12,030
- Pick a page at the front. - Here I go.

2117
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,900
(What kind of food will they get?)

2118
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,070
(They get beef.)

2119
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,140
- Beef. - Counting 1, 2...

2120
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,550
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2121
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:25,310
- Beef. - Counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

2122
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:26,920
(What will be the 8th dish?)

2123
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,090
Seven, eight.

2124
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:32,390
- Beef tongue. - Beef tongue.

2125
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,960
- It's okay. Beef tongue is nice. - Did I count right?

2126
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,260
- Tongue. - Maybe we should go this way.

2127
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,270
- Beef tongue. - It's okay. Beef tongue is nice.

2128
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,520
- Did I count right? - Tongue.

2129
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,970
- Did I count right? One, two... - Tongue.

2130
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:41,800
Maybe we should go this way. One, two, three, four,

2131
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,270
five, six, seven... We still get beef tongue.

2132
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,310
How much can we eat?

2133
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:46,100
- Beef tongue is tasty. - Beef tongue.

2134
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,840
- It's expensive. It's 30 dollars. - Is it 30 dollars?

2135
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,510
Beef tongue is a good choice.

2136
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:51,510
- Beef tongue. - Ribs would have been nice.

2137
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,600
- Beef ribs. - It's okay. Beef tongue is nice.

2138
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,520
- Why are you so disappointed? - Do you like beef tongue?

2139
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,220
I like beef tongue. It's tasty.

2140
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,420
- It's tasty. Order four servings. - Four servings.

2141
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,560
- Order four servings for now. - I am not used to that cut.

2142
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:06,650
Had we gone one page further, we would have eaten japchae.

2143
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:08,690
We would have eaten japchae.

2144
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:10,190
- Let's be thankful for what we got. - Really?

2145
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:12,020
- Let's go someplace else. - A dessert place.

2146
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,170
- Let's go someplace else. - Before you eat...

2147
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:16,140
- Since we are very close, - Seriously.

2148
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,470
we feel relaxed.

2149
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,510
Things are going so smoothly.

2150
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:22,400
I shouldn't use all of my luck on this game.

2151
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,940
- Use it on the Grand Award. - I know.

2152
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,140
Shall I check the stock prices?

2153
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,640
I should check KOSPI.

2154
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,110
Maybe you have luck with everything but the stocks.

2155
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,550
I am seeing a blue arrow.

2156
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,850
- I think... - Minus one percent.

2157
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,390
you have luck with everything but the stocks.

2158
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:40,650
What's the point of eating meat? I am losing money here.

2159
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:44,020
My goodness.

2160
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:45,430
Suk Jin, what are you doing?

2161
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:47,930
- Suk Jin. - I think you used up your luck.

2162
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:51,140
- I think it's done. - I became unlucky again.

2163
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:54,380
I suddenly dunked my phone in the sauce.

2164
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,680
There is no beef tongue. We are out of it.

2165
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,270
- Beef tongue. - They are out of beef tongue.

2166
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,480
Really? What do we do in this situation?

2167
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:02,420
- What do we do? - It can't be helped.

2168
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:03,850
You are flustered too, right?

2169
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,680
- We will eat the eighth item... - It will take a long time.

2170
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,940
on the menu on the wall.

2171
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,060
- Let's do that. - One, two, three, four...

2172
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:11,980
- Five, six, seven, eight. - Pork and kimchi jeongol.

2173
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,820
- Let's eat that. - Let's eat that.

2174
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:15,460
- Pork and kimchi jeongol. - Let's eat that.

2175
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,150
- Sir. - Four servings.

2176
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,520
- Okay. - Haha and my YouTube channels...

2177
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,300
are stagnant.

2178
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,840
- I feel like I am dying. - Do you know how hard it is?

2179
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,170
I am taking a break.

2180
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:25,430
Did you stop filming new videos?

2181
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,600
You should call people over and drink with them.

2182
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,380
- You like to drink. - Seriously.

2183
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,210
- These days, I can't drink. - You should do what you like.

2184
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:34,720
Why not? Why can't you drink?

2185
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,350
- It makes my body ache. - Really?

2186
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:37,920
You are too young for that.

2187
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,850
Look at Ji Hyo. She is still springy.

2188
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,390
- How much can you drink these days? - His liver needs to recover.

2189
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,810
- Me? - How much can you drink these days?

2190
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,390
Sometimes, I get drunk after drinking four cans of beer.

2191
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:47,600
- Really? But that's a lot. - Wouldn't anyone get drunk?

2192
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,150
You mean the ones that cost 10 dollars for 4 cans, right?

2193
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,890
That's a lot.

2194
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,360
Those cans are this big.

2195
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,670
- You mean the big cans, right? - The big cans.

2196
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,560
- Wine. - I get drunk on those.

2197
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,010
- Anyone would get drunk. - Who gets drunk on four cans?

2198
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:02,030
Some people get drunk on one can of beer.

2199
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,680
- What? - It depends on the alcohol type.

2200
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,600
I got wasted after drinking 1,000ml of beer.

2201
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,140
- My goodness. - I got wasted.

2202
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:11,810
I used to drink 30 dollars worth of beer.

2203
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:13,850
(12 cans of beer)

2204
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:16,460
- You drank 12 cans of beer. - I drank 12 cans of beer.

2205
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:18,820
- You are incredible. - You drank 12 cans of beer.

2206
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:20,650
- What? - Seriously.

2207
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:22,820
(The 8th item on the menu appears.)

2208
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,270
It looks so appetizing.

2209
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,020
- This place is amazing. - It's a proper meal.

2210
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:28,300
We added a lot of meat.

2211
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,640
(It's the kimchi jeongol with a lot of pork.)

2212
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,600
Sir, my goodness.

2213
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,810
Nice shot.

2214
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:34,030
Thank you.

2215
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,070
(Ji Hyo scoops out cooked kimchi for the others.)

2216
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:37,740
It should be in the middle, right?

2217
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,240
- There is a lot of pork. - My goodness.

2218
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,140
The more you boil it, the tastier it gets.

2219
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:44,020
We can keep on boiling it.

2220
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,850
Please give me a lot of meat.

2221
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,920
- Enjoy the food. - I am not faking it.

2222
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,090
In a sense,

2223
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,850
we are sightseeing while they are struggling.

2224
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:58,390
- I know. - Right?

2225
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,670
- They must be struggling. - Seriously.

2226
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:04,430
- I bet they haven't eaten. - It's so tasty.

2227
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,060
- Something like fish-shaped bun. - Fish-shaped bun...

2228
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:07,430
or hotteok.

2229
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:10,010
Why don't we go near Apgujeong and hang out?

2230
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,070
- We can do that. - We can do that.

2231
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:13,600
- Right? - Let's do the two missions.

2232
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,810
We don't have enough time for anything else.

2233
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,110
(While Team Suk Jin enjoys tasty lunch at Myeongdong)

2234
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:18,780
But we can do the missions and eat dessert.

2235
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,780
We aren't the only ones who are struggling, right?

2236
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,920
They should get lost too.

2237
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,730
We aren't the only ones who got lost, right?

2238
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,980
- This is a disaster. - Do we need to be there by 2 p.m.?

2239
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,060
That doesn't matter.

2240
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:29,430
No?

2241
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:32,020
We should have a cup of coffee.

2242
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,020
- But... - We came all the way here.

2243
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,730
We shouldn't leave Gimpo without doing anything.

2244
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:38,600
Let's go to a cafe.

2245
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,640
A cafe?

2246
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,900
- Where will we find a cafe? - There has to be a cafe...

2247
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:45,680
- somewhere. - How about a convenience store?

2248
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:46,880
There are no cafes.

2249
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:47,980
(Disappointed)

2250
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,110
- What should we do? - Se Chan, I need to apply this.

2251
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:51,110
Come here.

2252
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,240
I can't believe it.

2253
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,480
- Come here for a second. - This is...

2254
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,350
Would it be okay if we sit here for a short while?

2255
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,730
Thank you.

2256
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:00,590
- Sit here. - Thank you.

2257
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,430
- I want to eat something. - Sit down.

2258
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,170
You can eat what's on the first shelf.

2259
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:07,930
- What? - Did we pick number one?

2260
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,640
- The first shelf? - Did my eyelashes get stuck?

2261
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,640
Half of them are curled.

2262
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,810
(The Camel Eyelashes Perm is nearing its end.)

2263
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:14,880
This is suffocating.

2264
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,210
So whether it's a fridge or not, it needs to be on the first shelf.

2265
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,880
It's hard to pick an item on the first shelf.

2266
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:21,880
(He can only pick an item on the 1st shelf.)

2267
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:26,480
What I want isn't on the first shelf.

2268
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,980
Here is a wet wipe.

2269
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,420
- Hold on. - I will use an upward motion...

2270
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:30,720
so that your eye doesn't sting.

2271
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,850
Like this.

2272
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:36,230
(My goodness.)

2273
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:37,390
Use an upward motion.

2274
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,690
There you go.

2275
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,270
(He braved the stinging sensation to get his eyelashes permed.)

2276
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:43,060
It's really uncomfortable.

2277
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,770
- How is it? My eye stings. - They are a bit curled.

2278
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:46,670
Hold on. I will use a cotton swab to remove the formula.

2279
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:48,530
My eye stings. My eyelashes are curled, right?

2280
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,730
- They are curled. - You completed the first mission.

2281
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:52,050
Okay. Good.

2282
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,070
- Let's hurry up and go to Seoul. - Let's go back.

2283
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:56,550
(Glancing over)

2284
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:58,550
I will carry it.

2285
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,180
Do you want to ride it?

2286
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,650
What are you doing?

2287
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:04,060
What are you doing? Do you want to ride it to Seoul?

2288
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,980
I thought it was new for a second.

2289
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,760
- My goodness. - Jae Suk, let's hurry up and go.

2290
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,600
- He wanted to take the scooter. - Jae Suk.

2291
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,060
- Hey. - That would be theft.

2292
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,490
You are frugal.

2293
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,470
I am beginning to give up.

2294
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:20,100
Seriously. What should we do?

2295
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,140
He wanted to take the scooter.

2296
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,810
Jae Suk, we need to hurry up and get out of Gimpo.

2297
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:28,720
This is why they say that you struggle when you leave home.

2298
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,770
(The unfortunate trio is struggling a lot.)

2299
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:33,180
I have no luck when I play this kind of game.

2300
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:35,310
You are filming Running Man.

2301
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:37,890
Se Chan.

2302
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:38,930
Hello.

2303
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,060
- That's right. - Ma'am.

2304
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:43,190
We were in Yeouido.

2305
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,190
We were supposed to go to Apgujeong,

2306
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:47,060
but we got on the wrong bus due to the mission.

2307
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:50,900
- We got on the wrong bus. - We came all the way to Gimpo.

2308
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,640
I will tell my friends that I saw celebrities.

2309
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:54,930
Thank you.

2310
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,900
- All of you are good-looking. - Thank you.

2311
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,010
All of you are good-looking.

2312
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,270
You are lying.

2313
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,920
She is lying.

2314
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,520
You should believe her words.

2315
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,920
(Jae Suk is quick-witted in this sense.)

2316
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,150
Seriously.

2317
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:09,180
Thank you.

2318
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:10,480
- Take care. - Thank you.

2319
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,730
Bye.

2320
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:12,850
Stay healthy.

2321
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:15,460
I guess she watches the show. She knows all of us.

2322
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,520
She knows all of us.

2323
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,390
(Their lucky number is one.)

2324
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:20,470
What?

2325
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:23,430
Here it is. This is the bus.

2326
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:25,930
(They found a bus stop after wandering around aimlessly.)

2327
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:27,270
This is the bus we need to take.

2328
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:28,980
Bus 8601.

2329
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,010
That's right.

2330
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,310
(The bus number contains 1.)

2331
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,900
(Modam Village)

2332
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:38,480
Let's go to Dangsan Station.

2333
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,090
It will arrive seven minutes later.

2334
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:41,890
This is the bus we need to take.

2335
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,680
- It will arrive 7 minutes later. - It will arrive 7 minutes later.

2336
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,060
Bus 8601 will arrive 7 minutes later.

2337
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:47,480
We need to take Bus 8601.

2338
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,760
- You see the number of empty seats. - Seven minutes.

2339
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:52,730
(Seats)

2340
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:53,990
(Bus 8601: 68 seats)

2341
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,670
(Touching)

2342
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:57,970
It isn't a touchscreen.

2343
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,100
(Laughing)

2344
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:03,710
To be honest, I had no expectations from the start.

2345
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:05,510
I knew this would happen when I saw the team members.

2346
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:07,940
We have been here...

2347
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:09,940
for an hour.

2348
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,020
We have been here for an hour.

2349
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,590
Sit down, Se Chan.

2350
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:16,760
- Yes? - What?

2351
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,430
- I forgot to take a photo. - A photo.

2352
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:19,820
That's a good idea. Come this way.

2353
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:25,020
- Take a photo with us. - Take a photo with us.

2354
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:27,730
- We had a conversation. - Come this way.

2355
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,560
- We should take a photo together. - Stand in the middle.

2356
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,060
- I don't know. - Come on.

2357
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,170
- Let's take a selfie. - Let's do it together.

2358
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,600
I wasn't going to be in the photo.

2359
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,680
Come here.

2360
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,210
Ma'am, where are you? There you are.

2361
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:41,420
One, two, three.

2362
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,020
(She makes a V-sign.)

2363
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,110
Okay.

2364
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:46,180
- Take care. - Bye.

2365
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,480
That's quite nice.

2366
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:51,260
- It slides out. - Yes.

2367
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:53,980
It must be a new model.

2368
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,150
Do you want to buy it?

2369
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,190
It's...

2370
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,320
Look at this.

2371
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,970
I haven't seen anything like it. It slides out for the camera.

2372
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,170
(Dropping)

2373
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,730
You dropped the jelly.

2374
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,400
It's okay if you eat it in three seconds.

2375
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:09,380
(Blowing)

2376
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:10,680
It's so fascinating.

2377
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,270
This is an unexpected side of a big star like you.

2378
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,740
- It's a wallet. - It's easy for taking photos.

2379
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,770
- The phone case. - You can take photos like this.

2380
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:19,590
There are so many new items these days.

2381
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:20,590
It's old.

2382
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:22,090
- I bought it three years ago. - He is like a middle-aged woman.

2383
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,810
- Really? - Middle-aged woman Yoo.

2384
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,230
- Take care. - Thank you.

2385
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:27,630
(They finally say goodbye.)

2386
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:28,690
How fascinating.

2387
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:30,100
- He didn't even know... - It's convenient.

2388
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,490
that he was dropping jelly.

2389
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:34,490
He was crazy about the phone case. "What's this?"

2390
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:38,310
Can we go back to Seoul? You need to focus.

2391
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,600
It's the jelly you dropped.

2392
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,530
It's here.

2393
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:42,570
(At that moment)

2394
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,710
- It's here. - We need to get on the bus.

2395
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,210
Put on your mask.

2396
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:47,380
(The bus they have been waiting for, Bus 8601 arrives.)

2397
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:48,520
Hello.

2398
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,180
(They will leave Gimpo after an hour.)

2399
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,240
We need to pay.

2400
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:54,720
(Dangsan Station is one stop away!)

2401
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,760
Three people.

2402
01:21:57,090 --> 01:21:59,180
We need to go out and do the missions.

2403
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,930
- The missions. - Shall we do them here or outside?

2404
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,100
- Shall we pick one first? - Yes.

2405
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,130
- Shall we do that? - I will pick a mission.

2406
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:06,300
We don't have much time, so we need to hurry up.

2407
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:08,470
If we keep wasting time...

2408
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:10,730
That's right. We will end up running late.

2409
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,670
- Who will pick it? - I will do it.

2410
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,310
- Am I picking a mission? - Yes.

2411
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:16,180
(Suk Jin picks the 1st mission.)

2412
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,400
What's this?

2413
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,600
- What is it? - I don't know.

2414
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,850
There were 4 or 5 balls inside.

2415
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:21,850
(They need to complete 2 missions to move to the ending location.)

2416
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:23,980
Should we complete two missions?

2417
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:25,590
- What is it? - What is it?

2418
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:27,760
(What will be Team Suk Jin's first mission?)

2419
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:35,680
Bowling?

2420
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:39,260
(Bowling?)

2421
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,430
I think that's what we did earlier.

2422
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:45,360
The headbanging thing we did.

2423
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,000
- That one? - Here...

2424
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,540
You will go to a bowling alley.

2425
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:50,600
- What? - And you will bowl with citizens.

2426
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,710
- Really? - If you win as many times...

2427
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:54,340
as the number, it's over.

2428
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:57,900
- A real bowling game? - But the number is eight.

2429
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:01,750
Are we going to a real bowling alley to play bowling?

2430
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,090
- There's no twist. - I know.

2431
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:05,390
Do you have ping-pong?

2432
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,830
Where is a bowling alley? We should find one.

2433
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,790
- Let's look for it. - A bowling alley near here.

2434
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:13,600
There's one near the Dosan Park Intersection.

2435
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:16,520
There's a bowling alley. It's 1.5km from here.

2436
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,860
We should go to Gangnam anyway. Should we go there?

2437
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:21,060
We can go there for the mission.

2438
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,840
The one in Yongsan is farther.

2439
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:24,900
The travel route is really good.

2440
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,430
- It's perfect. - I know.

2441
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:29,710
So we should go and play bowling with people there.

2442
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:32,080
- With the citizens there. - With the citizens.

2443
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,090
But people in the bowling alley...

2444
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:36,610
- must be good at bowling. - There's one in Yongsan.

2445
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:38,760
- They must be good. - People at the bowling alley?

2446
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,460
- They should be good. - I haven't bowled for a long time.

2447
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:42,630
- You don't know the average. - Let's go.

2448
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:43,850
You don't know the average.

2449
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:46,600
That doesn't matter even if you're good at it.

2450
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,890
We can't bowl.

2451
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:50,170
Let's go to the Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral first.

2452
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:52,040
- Okay. - Let's go.

2453
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,340
- Is it done? - It's done.

2454
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:56,710
- My gosh. - I'm tired.

2455
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:58,400
I'm exhausted.

2456
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,710
I didn't do anything special, but why am I tired already?

2457
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:01,080
I'm so tired.

2458
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,350
(They're exhausted already, but they're at the starting point.)

2459
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:04,940
- Gosh. - Oh, dear.

2460
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,420
What did we do for an hour and a half?

2461
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:08,480
I don't know. The eyelash perm.

2462
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,250
The eyelash perm, and at the convenience store...

2463
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:11,980
- We ate at the convenience store. - We had a drink...

2464
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,610
- and some jelly. - That's it.

2465
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,680
- I told you. - For the next bus...

2466
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:19,300
I should pick a good number. Gosh.

2467
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,500
Then let's decide whether we take a bus or a taxi.

2468
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,000
Okay. Let's do that.

2469
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,100
There must be a bus to get there.

2470
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,800
Is there a bus from Yeouido to Gangnam?

2471
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,260
There are a lot.

2472
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,970
We're on the Olympic Expressway again.

2473
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:33,080
At least the bus won't stop on this road.

2474
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,100
(Again on the Olympic Expressway)

2475
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,600
- It feels better. - Right.

2476
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,080
This is what I said before. It's like a hare and a tortoise.

2477
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:40,970
We're tortoises now.

2478
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:42,720
Right. The hare will take a nap...

2479
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,590
- and lose the race. - Exactly. It falls behind.

2480
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:46,220
We don't have much time.

2481
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:47,220
(Team Jae Suk is determined to catch up with the hare.)

2482
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,890
To catch the hare.

2483
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:51,500
Gosh, we're in Seoul again.

2484
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,330
- Gosh, we're back. - It's been hours.

2485
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:54,600
It's been hours already.

2486
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,600
- This looks delicious. - This is the place.

2487
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,470
Look. They are eating beef noodles here.

2488
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,600
- It sounds delicious. - There's mala soup.

2489
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,800
That's macaroon.

2490
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:04,210
- It sounds great. - Macaroon?

2491
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:05,730
- Let's... - This place looks nice.

2492
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:08,850
Is there a place that sells hotteok?

2493
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:11,720
- Gosh, this is... - I have a craving for hotteok.

2494
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,250
I want it too.

2495
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:16,390
It will take a long time to bowl. We should probably hurry.

2496
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:18,090
- We should hurry. - Right.

2497
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:20,290
Bowling will take a long time.

2498
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:22,150
There's a bus stop.

2499
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,150
Where? I see.

2500
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:25,960
- We should pick a good number. - Yes.

2501
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,390
There's a bus stop.

2502
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,330
We have to be careful here.

2503
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:32,500
Gosh, there are buses that go everywhere.

2504
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,800
- We might end up in trouble. - We should be careful.

2505
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,430
- Do you want to go now? - We should go.

2506
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,100
- Let's check the buses first. - Check the routes first.

2507
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,730
We should complete number eight to go to Gangnam, right?

2508
01:25:40,730 --> 01:25:42,580
There's no bus that goes to Gangnam from here.

2509
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:45,110
- There's no bus? - No bus to Gangnam?

2510
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:48,350
(There's no bus to Gangnam?)

2511
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:50,850
- We have number eight. - There's no bus.

2512
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:51,960
There's no bus?

2513
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,890
Hang on. If we pick number seven,

2514
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:56,980
we will have to go to Suwon.

2515
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:58,850
- No. - No, don't pick number seven.

2516
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:00,390
No, this one is number seven.

2517
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:02,260
We shouldn't pick number seven.

2518
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,390
Don't pick number seven.

2519
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:05,890
If we pick a wrong number here,

2520
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,540
we will go very far.

2521
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,470
- We have to pick number 4. - If we pick number 3...

2522
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:11,100
- We shouldn't pick number three. - Right.

2523
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,640
- We can't go to Bundang. - Right.

2524
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,600
We might end up in Bundang.

2525
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,300
Let's hurry.

2526
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:19,470
Hang on. This is... Yeongdeungpo Han River Park.

2527
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:20,920
How far can we go...

2528
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,310
- We should've gone straight. - in only eight minutes.

2529
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:23,680
So Min, hurry.

2530
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:25,420
Hey, hurry and come.

2531
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,090
So Min. Jae Suk, we should take a bus here.

2532
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:29,390
Hurry.

2533
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,520
(The fast hare, Team Suk Jin)

2534
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,220
(Their fate changes only with a lucky number.)

2535
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,000
(Where are we going?)

2536
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:36,470
(Good luck finally visits Team Gimpo.)

2537
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:38,540
(They have to win some points!)

2538
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:41,710
(A perfect mission for them)

2539
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,540
(Team Tortoise speeds up in excitement.)

2540
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:48,800
(Team Hare should win a specific number of times.)

2541
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:52,310
(Lady luck isn't on their side.)

2542
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,470
(And they are against a strong bowler?)

2543
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:55,980
(Are you kidding me?)

2544
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,720
(The revolt of the tortoises)

2545
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,460
(Who will Lady Luck be smiling on?)

2546
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,850
(The Lucky Number Race)

2547
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:02,850
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
