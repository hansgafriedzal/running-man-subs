1
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,420
Gosh, that was hard.

2
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,790
This is crazy. Jae Suk.

3
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,990
We're back to square one.

4
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,230
Let me catch my breath.

5
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,630
Let's warm up here.

6
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,010
- What, Jae Suk...
- Come on and warm up.

7
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,110
Okay.

8
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,180
- Gosh, this is...
- I need to stretch my back.

9
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,510
Stretch your back.

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,780
Where is it? It's not here.

11
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,750
So Min, you should try this.

12
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,140
(They exercise on the street.)

13
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,620
This feels really good, So Min.

14
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,020
People would think...

15
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,820
"What are they doing
as soon as they got off the bus?"

16
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,390
We took the bus for a long time.

17
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,250
One, two.

18
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,130
- First...
- Do we eat?

19
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,760
Are we eating?

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,930
- But...
- Jae Suk, are we going?

21
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,390
Considering many things...

22
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,390
What about that place? The cafe.

23
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,610
- Or gimbap.
- There's a gimbap place.

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,970
Why don't we have some gimbap?

25
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,110
- So Min.
- Yes?

26
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,350
We're far behind the other team.

27
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,540
Something simple.

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,450
- What do you want?
- Ramyeon with gimbap.

29
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,470
- If...
- What time is it now?

30
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,710
- If we do that...
- I knew he'd fall for that.

31
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,420
- He loves ramyeon.
- It's 12 p.m. now.

32
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,420
Let's leave at 12:30 p.m.

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,250
What about this?
Why don't we eat after one step?

34
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,390
- Because... For now...
- Just in case.

35
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,230
There are many reasons.
It's lunchtime now.

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,700
So we won't be able to shoot...

37
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,590
- in a crowded restaurant.
- We can't do that.

38
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,170
I don't think
the gimbap place is crowded.

39
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,400
We can just eat ramyeon and gimbap.

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,430
You must be really hungry.

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,900
- All right then.
- Ramyeon and gimbap?

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,370
- Yes, ramyeon and gimbap.
- Let's decide by majority.

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,900
- Are we going or eating?
- Okay.

44
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,870
Raise your hand
if you want to eat gimbap.

45
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,810
- Raise my hand?
- Raise your hand for gimbap.

46
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,790
Since we are far behind
the other team,

47
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,810
we need to catch up.

48
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,090
We should go before we eat?

49
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,760
- Yes. We need to move once.
- Move once.

50
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,420
I'll ask then. Gimbap.
One, two, and three.

51
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,400
(So Min wants to eat gimbap.)

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,960
All right then.

53
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
- We should go.
- We should go first.

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,000
(Jae Suk and Se Chan
want to move first.)

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,640
- So Min.
- Don't be upset.

56
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,870
- It's not like that.
- So Min, we have no choice.

57
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,110
If you were going to do this,
you could've just told me so.

58
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,510
- Why did you give...
- It's not like that.

59
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,870
such a long speech?

60
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,780
- Come here, So Min.
- Let's take a bus.

61
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,120
Or let's take a taxi.
Jae Suk, what do we do?

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,250
Taxi.

63
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,480
Since your number is 1,
you can take a taxi for 1 minute.

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,150
- We can't do that.
- We will pick a number again.

65
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,620
- Let's do that.
- We should pick it again.

66
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,450
- So Min, you pick it.
- We have 8 and 5.

67
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,520
- Which is better?
- Eight is better.

68
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,490
Once you pick a number,
you have to follow it.

69
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,470
- Okay.
- Of course.

70
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,890
- Hang on.
- Pick eight.

71
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,700
- You're not supposed to look.
- I just checked the numbers.

72
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,070
- To see if there are three numbers.
- Don't look.

73
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,540
You can't see the numbers.

74
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,910
I was going to break it here.

75
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,800
Let go. You want to break this?

76
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,140
(He tries to manipulate it.)

77
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,350
We can't do that. I'll pick again.

78
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,880
- All right.
- I'll go with this.

79
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,240
- Did you pick one?
- Yes.

80
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,480
- It's eight.
- Eight.

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,510
(It's 8!)

82
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,640
- It's eight.
- Okay.

83
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,420
You can take a taxi.

84
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,920
- Let's take a taxi.
- A taxi or a bus?

85
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,390
- Let's take a taxi for 8 minutes.
- Take a taxi for 8 minutes.

86
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,630
- For eight minutes.
- Okay. Cross the street first.

87
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,290
Jae Suk, should we go downtown?

88
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,790
(Team Jae Suk chooses
to take a taxi for 8 minutes.)

89
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,390
(Jae Suk crosses the road
at the crosswalk.)

90
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,640
(The younger tortoises follow him.)

91
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,990
Should we cross the street?

92
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,290
(The younger tortoises follow him.)

93
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,200
Jae Suk, do you know where to go?

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,770
- He doesn't know.
- What are you doing?

95
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,010
- It's not here.
- Jae Suk, this is a parking lot.

96
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,920
Hey, this is...

97
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,640
You're wasting time.

98
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,920
- So Min.
- I thought this was a crosswalk.

99
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,240
But this is a parking lot.

100
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,320
So Min, come here.

101
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,010
- This is for bikes.
- We should go this way.

102
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,290
- This is where bikes are parked.
- There's no way out.

103
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,890
There's no crosswalk.

104
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,920
- You're wasting time.
- My goodness.

105
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,360
This is a parking lot.

106
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,540
A parking lot for two-wheeled vehicles.
This is crazy.

107
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,700
- We should hurry and go. Thank you.
- Let's go.

108
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

109
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,070
(They go back to where they were
feeling embarrassed.)

110
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,610
- So Min.
- Jae Suk, we should go this way.

111
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,910
- Let's go over there.
- We should cross the road.

112
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,410
So Min, this is a mess.

113
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,640
Jae Suk, don't lead the way.

114
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
No matter what show I do,

115
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,420
my team always struggles.

116
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,360
- I think you have the energy.
- This is strange.

117
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,420
My gosh. This is hilarious.

118
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,820
- Anyway...
- Hang on.

119
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,450
- We should take a taxi there.
- Yes.

120
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,070
Jae Suk, we should go this way.

121
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,330
Then we will take
the Olympic Expressway.

122
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,290
If we go this way...

123
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,170
- Is it Yeongdeungpo?
- It goes downtown.

124
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,640
- Is it Mok-dong this way?
- Then...

125
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,330
(They keep looking around,
but it looks confusing.)

126
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,110
- I think it's faster this way.
- We should go this way,

127
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,070
but we can't take a taxi here.

128
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,010
On this road.

129
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,610
(Blank)

130
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,310
Hey, we can't do this today.

131
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,520
Jae Suk, let's just eat
something delicious.

132
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,620
Let's just eat.

133
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,180
Let's just goof around.

134
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,960
- Jae Suk, we can go shopping.
- My goodness.

135
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,490
- Let's do that.
- This is driving me crazy.

136
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,790
I have the production crew's card.

137
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,690
- This is driving me crazy.
- Let's have fun.

138
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,340
- Let's have some jeongol.
- Right.

139
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,110
The other team picked
the bowling mission,

140
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,170
so you should do
the karaoke mission.

141
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,850
I said there would be two missions.

142
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,740
Did they pick that?

143
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,610
They picked the bowling one,
so you have the karaoke one.

144
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,650
Let's take it easy.

145
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,590
- Let's just go.
- Let's cross the road first.

146
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,460
If we go to a karaoke room...

147
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,090
- Let's go to a coin karaoke.
- Okay. Let's do that.

148
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,290
(Dangsan Station, Myeong-dong)

149
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,680
This goes to Soon Chun Hyang
University Hospital.

150
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,290
- Okay. That sounds nice.
- Hello.

151
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,290
(Team Suk Jin took a bus
at Myeong-dong after eating.)

152
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

153
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,290
- Should we sit in the back?
- Yes.

154
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,860
We barely managed to stay in Seoul.

155
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,170
- We're lucky.
- It was so close.

156
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,340
If we went one more stop,
we would've ended up in Pangyo.

157
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,610
It could've been Pangyo.

158
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,000
- Gosh, fortunately...
- We could've...

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,150
taken a nap after lunch.

160
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,150
- Fortunately...
- If we went to Pangyo,

161
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,150
we would've given up.

162
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,650
We should give up there.

163
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,650
"We lose."

164
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,020
Fortunately, we got off at
Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital.

165
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,810
- We can take a taxi there.
- We should take a taxi then.

166
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,290
(They are getting closer
to Apgujeong.)

167
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,880
- We're here.
- Thank you.

168
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,550
- Gosh.
- Oh, dear.

169
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,360
Let's take a taxi now.

170
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,690
Our number is four, so...

171
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,900
It's three.

172
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,990
Right. It's 3, so we can take
a taxi only for 3 minutes.

173
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,290
- Let's switch it to nine.
- Okay.

174
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,130
Three is
the smallest number we have.

175
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,360
What if we pick three again?

176
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,370
(They've got nothing to lose,
so they pick a number again.)

177
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,710
(Team Suk Jin's numbers:
3, 7, 8, 9)

178
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,710
Okay.

179
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,800
- Let's go right away.
- I'll open it right away.

180
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,440
(They need to pick a big number.)

181
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,480
One, two, and three.

182
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
- Okay.
- Good.

183
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
- Eight.
- Eight minutes.

184
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,310
- Eight is really good.
- Okay. It's eight.

185
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,360
- You pick 8 a lot.
- It's good that I wrote 8.

186
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,520
I keep getting number eight.

187
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,420
- He picks it a lot.
- Eight.

188
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,730
Should we take a taxi?

189
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,230
Why don't we go to a cafe and
have the eighth drink on the menu?

190
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,490
- Sounds good.
- Let's go to a cafe and try...

191
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,690
- the eighth drink.
- Let's do that.

192
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,990
- We have enough time.
- Let's go.

193
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,540
- Let's go.
- We will have the eighth drink.

194
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,130
- Is that all right?
- Okay.

195
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,670
- Let's go.
- Go.

196
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,110
I saw one over here.
There's also Blue Bottle Coffee.

197
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,000
There it is.
The eighth drink on the menu.

198
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,670
Okay.

199
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,850
There's something. It's the menu.

200
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,610
- It's a latte.
- The eighth drink.

201
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,610
It's a latte.

202
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,240
- Clove latte.
- Clove latte.

203
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,110
One of us should go in
and buy the coffee.

204
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,520
- I'll go buy it.
- Okay.

205
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,590
I want soybean milk for my latte.

206
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,920
- I'll try.
- Okay.

207
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,190
(Ji Hyo receives the orders
and goes in the cafe alone.)

208
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,900
- Hello.
- Where do I place my order?

209
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,490
Ji Hyo is not used to new stuff like this.
Why did we send her?

210
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,130
I once asked Ji Hyo
if she had been to a drive-through.

211
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,230
- And she said, "A dry booth?"
- Right.

212
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,170
- A dry booth.
- A dry booth.

213
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,310
Could you please
write down your name here?

214
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,920
(Ji Hyo is having a lonely battle
with the new culture.)

215
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,110
When your name is called...

216
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,660
(After a long struggle,
she manages to pay.)

217
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,730
It's here.

218
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,030
(Number 27, Song)

219
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,620
Things are going so well for us.

220
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,170
- Let's see where they are now.
- Okay.

221
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,600
I'm a little anxious though.

222
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,690
Right. Just a little.

223
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,690
We can't be all relaxed.

224
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,610
Didn't they catch up with us?

225
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,080
I don't think so. Probably.

226
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,980
- Seok Sam.
- Hey.

227
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,370
- Where are you?
- Us?

228
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,870
- Yes.
- We're at Apgujeong Rodeo Station.

229
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,790
We have some time to spare,
so we want to grab a bite.

230
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,980
It's so obvious that he's lying.

231
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,730
- What?
- Did you play bowling or not?

232
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,860
Bowling?

233
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,460
- Yes.
- Bowling...

234
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,600
We just finished bowling.

235
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Suk Jin, you're looking
for a bowling alley now, right?

236
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,990
No, we just finished it.

237
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,970
I think I just hit the nail
right on the head.

238
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,970
(Seok Sam is caught
that they didn't play bowling yet.)

239
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,270
Where are you, Jae Suk?

240
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,580
- We are...
- Yes.

241
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,410
We're in Sinsa-dong now.

242
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,000
- My gosh.
- Sinsa-dong, Eunpyeong-gu?

243
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,210
That's enough.

244
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,870
Aren't you staying
in Sinsa-dong for too long?

245
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,720
You said you were
in Sinsa-dong before.

246
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,920
Didn't you say you were
in Sinsa-dong an hour ago?

247
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
(Laughing)

248
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

249
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,530
- We have to cross the street.
- Let's go.

250
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,180
Let's hurry and go.

251
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,990
Hurry, So Min.

252
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,100
Hurry and come, So Min.

253
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,900
Hey, hurry.

254
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,400
(They suddenly start running after
finding out about Team Suk Jin.)

255
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,600
- So Min.
- Yes.

256
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,900
Jae Suk, let's take a taxi here.

257
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,360
Hurry.

258
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,710
- It's coming.
- It's coming.

259
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,130
- It's coming.
- It's done.

260
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,500
It's here.

261
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,320
- Hello.
- Thank you, sir.

262
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,770
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

263
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,880
Sir.

264
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,320
For eight minutes...
We need to go to Apgujeong.

265
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
- I'm sorry, but...
- You should set the alarm.

266
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,830
Should we set the alarm?

267
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,460
All right. Good.

268
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,800
- All right.
- Thank you, sir.

269
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,330
- Start.
- We didn't ask for this in advance.

270
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,800
But we're communicating well.

271
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,360
- You should press start.
- Press start first.

272
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,390
(They met a driver who understands
the mission very well.)

273
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,030
- It's done.
- Thank you, sir.

274
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,400
Thank you so much, sir.

275
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,770
The driver is quick-witted.

276
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,940
Right. He set the alarm right away.

277
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,450
You're like one of our members.

278
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

279
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,270
(The 8-minute drive
begins to get to Apgujeong.)

280
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,350
How much can we go in eight minutes?
We can't get there, can we?

281
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,980
Sir, how far
can we go in eight minutes?

282
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,150
We should go to Yeouido.

283
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,320
- Yeouido?
- We should go to Yeouido.

284
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,860
(It's Yeouido again.)

285
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,650
Yeouido? Isn't that
where we started the race?

286
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,830
Yeouido...

287
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,060
Do you need to go somewhere else?

288
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,620
- No.
- No, it's all right.

289
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,990
That's the only way.

290
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,360
- So are we going to Yeouido?
- My gosh.

291
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,470
- Are we starting again there?
- I think so.

292
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,570
- It's reset.
- Right. Yeouido is...

293
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,130
- where we started the race.
- Really?

294
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,130
- The bus stop?
- Yes.

295
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,140
My gosh. We left at 10 a.m.

296
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,850
After two and a half hours,
we're back here.

297
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,680
This is ridiculous.

298
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,350
It's like a dream.
It feels like I'm in a dream.

299
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,960
Right. It takes about 30 minutes
to get to Gangnam from here.

300
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,520
Eight minutes isn't enough.

301
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,980
- We need to go to Apgujeong.
- How can you get to Apgujeong...

302
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
in eight minutes?

303
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,830
The woman sitting next you
told us to do that.

304
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,830
Oh, dumplings.

305
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,160
So Min, you must be hungry.

306
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,340
- We should eat something.
- I think I am.

307
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,500
There's a Starbucks.

308
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,340
So Min, you're hungry.

309
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,480
Jae Suk, there's a pork restaurant.
We're in Mullae-dong now.

310
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,770
- Near the Yeongdeungpo Market.
- My gosh.

311
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,980
Sushi.

312
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,480
(She's hungry, so all she can see
are restaurant signs.)

313
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,690
There's a market.

314
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,450
So Min, there's a sundae alley.

315
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,610
Se Chan.

316
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,560
- We should eat when we get off.
- Right.

317
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,430
I don't think I should be
here with you.

318
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,360
So Min, we will eat something
when we get off.

319
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,800
- So Min seems really hungry.
- Right.

320
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,060
What's the name of this show?

321
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,160
- We are...
- It's Running Man.

322
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,840
- It's SBS.
- It's Running Man on SBS...

323
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,470
which begins at 6:30 p.m.
on Sunday night.

324
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,570
(Running Man is on at 6:20 p.m.
starting from January 1.)

325
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,940
It's not 6:30 p.m. yet.

326
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,530
- It's not changed yet.
- Not yet?

327
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,610
That's why you run around places
all the time.

328
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,140
- Yes.
- Right.

329
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,610
Have you watched Running Man before?

330
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,740
- Of course.
- Thank you.

331
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,980
When I watch TV shows like
"The Fishermen and the City,"

332
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,780
I see people cook
with what they catch.

333
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,560
I went to the alley that was on
"A Walk Around the Neighborhood."

334
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,230
I can tell
you don't watch Running Man.

335
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,730
(I can tell
you don't watch Running Man.)

336
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,160
If you watch
"A Walk Around the Neighborhood..."

337
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,400
I can tell
what kind of TV shows you prefer.

338
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,310
- But still...
- You don't like Running Man.

339
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,810
I watch it with my children.

340
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,580
I guess you watch our show
with your children or family.

341
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,980
Sure. It features Kim Jong Kook.

342
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,060
- That's the show, right?
- Yes.

343
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,560
I watch the reruns
from time to time.

344
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,150
(In the taxi driven
by the hidden viewer...)

345
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,390
There it is. That's it, So Min.

346
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,660
There it is, So Min.

347
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,530
This is where
we walked with Suk Jin.

348
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,660
- We are starting all over again.
- My goodness.

349
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,710
We have 30 seconds left.

350
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,000
Gosh, how is it...

351
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,130
I'm worried.

352
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,370
What if we go to Gimpo again?

353
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,640
- Please go straight, sir.
- Okay.

354
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,850
We can't go there
if we hit the red light.

355
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,780
My goodness.

356
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,610
- We won't go to Gimpo again, right?
- Count down.

357
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,910
Ten.

358
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,060
Nine. Eight.

359
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,880
- Seven. Six.
- Six.

360
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,750
- Five. Four.
- Five. Four. Three.

361
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,860
This is it.

362
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,470
- Time's up.
- Okay.

363
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,660
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

364
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,940
We're really here.

365
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,800
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

366
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,340
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

367
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,400
Stay healthy.

368
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,530
- Have a nice day.
- Yes. Stay healthy.

369
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,180
Bye.

370
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,710
So Min. This is it.

371
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,900
This is horrible.

372
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,870
We took the bus here
and went this way.

373
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,410
- What if we go to Gimpo again?
- What's happening?

374
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,350
You see the taxi over there.
That's where we walked.

375
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,780
We did that right over there.

376
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,150
(They danced "Hype Boy" here.)

377
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,730
We danced "Hype Boy" here.

378
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,030
(They danced around in excitement
without knowing what would happen.)

379
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,860
I think I will fall asleep before...

380
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,940
- watching the World Cup match.
- I don't think you can watch it.

381
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,870
- You won't be able to come.
- I think...

382
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,770
I'll fall asleep before watching it.

383
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,550
I just can't do this.

384
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,980
- They all have coffee here.
- Do you want some coffee?

385
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,770
- What's our number now?
- It's eight.

386
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,410
Jae Suk, what's our number? Eight?

387
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,480
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, and eight.

388
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,060
- Jae Suk, it's cafe mocha.
- It's cafe mocha.

389
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,560
- Cafe mocha is not bad.
- What are our numbers?

390
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,390
- One and five.
- One and five.

391
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,860
Number five is a latte.

392
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,660
Number five sounds good.
Shall we give it a try?

393
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,760
If we pick number five,
we should stick to the number.

394
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,230
(If we pick number 5,
we should stick to the number.)

395
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,600
What's number eight?

396
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,000
- Cafe mocha.
- It's mocha.

397
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,400
Chocolate and coffee.

398
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,110
- Let's pick number five.
- I don't like mocha.

399
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,400
- Let's try picking number five.
- I don't like mocha.

400
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,640
- Can we pick a number?
- Mocha is too thick.

401
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,240
I have the numbers.

402
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,450
- We need number 5.
- What we want now is...

403
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,640
- number 5.
- Number 5, latte.

404
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,850
Latte sounds better.

405
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,480
That's a basic menu.

406
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,090
- What's the number?
- Mocha.

407
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,460
My gosh.

408
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,590
(They pick number 8 again
for cafe mocha.)

409
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,730
Let's have cafe mocha.

410
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,380
- But mocha is too thick.
- Let's have some...

411
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,600
- We have no choice.
- We can't help it.

412
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,490
We will have three cups
of iced cafe mocha.

413
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,800
- Hello.
- Iced Americano?

414
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,490
- No, iced cafe mocha.
- Cafe mocha.

415
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,530
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

416
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,990
I'd like my mocha very weak.

417
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,570
- Me too.
- Make it weak?

418
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,070
- Not so sweet.
- Make all three weak.

419
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,210
Okay.

420
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,050
So Min, you seem to be
in a good mood today.

421
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,220
Why am I feeling good?

422
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,450
You look really...

423
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,690
- Do you think this is a date?
- No. I think So Min wants...

424
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,720
to show off her new hair.

425
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,930
- But...
- "I got my hair dyed."

426
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,650
I think
So Min likes stuff like this.

427
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,230
Walking around the streets
and taking busses.

428
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,390
I like taking busses.
It feels like I'm on a trip.

429
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,660
I wish it wasn't a game.

430
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,470
She's hanging out
with a close friend...

431
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,970
- and a guy she's interested in.
- Right.

432
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,360
And it's so romantic that there's
a coffee truck in the downtown area.

433
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
- It's romantic.
- It's so pretty.

434
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,480
She doesn't care about the missions.

435
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,610
- So Min.
- We need to do the mission.

436
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,610
We should go to Apgujeong.

437
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,900
- Really?
- Don't forget about the mission.

438
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,180
- I'm just feeling good.
- You think this is a date.

439
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,510
This is the financial district
in Yeouido.

440
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,610
And it's lunchtime now.

441
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,380
That's why
there are a lot of people.

442
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,150
They're here to have some coffee.

443
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,480
I'd like to ask them something.

444
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,360
When will the stock market recover?

445
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,700
What?

446
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,230
Should I buy stocks now or not?

447
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,660
- Buy or not?
- Should we buy stocks now?

448
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,070
Should I buy stocks now or not?

449
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,100
(Asking the question
in the Yeouido financial district)

450
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,630
Buy stocks or not?

451
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,710
(Should I buy stocks now or not?)

452
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,380
- Buy.
- Buy stocks now?

453
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,440
(Buy?)

454
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,090
- They say that in Yeouido.
- Buy now?

455
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,440
I got the news
in the Yeouido financial district.

456
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,590
- Buy?
- We should buy? Okay.

457
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,720
Buy now?

458
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,180
- It's not my money, so whatever.
- Buy mine.

459
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,760
- "It's not my money, so whatever?"
- "Buy mine?"

460
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,890
"Buy my stocks?"

461
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,050
- What...
- He wants us to buy his stocks.

462
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,650
"It's not my money, so whatever?"

463
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,870
This looks good.

464
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,290
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

465
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,430
- Let's go.
- Let me ask you again. Buy?

466
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,640
- Buy.
- Buy?

467
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,200
- Are you sure?
- Buy?

468
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,660
Because it's not your money?

469
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,400
(They give bold advice
because it's not about their money.)

470
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,900
- Buy or not?
- "Buy it with your own money."

471
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,070
There's a bakery down here.

472
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,350
Why don't we go to the bakery
and buy the eighth bread?

473
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,770
Right. The eighth one on the menu.
What do you think?

474
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,750
- I'll be back soon.
- Wait here.

475
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,050
- The eighth bread on the menu.
- The eighth one.

476
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,890
(The lucky number: 8)

477
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,260
Hello.

478
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,020
- Is this the menu?
- It's over here.

479
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,550
- Is this it?
- Yes.

480
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,020
Is this the menu?

481
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:49,030
- It's ice cream.
- Is it just ice cream? I see.

482
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,510
Where are cookies?

483
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,300
(Obviously, they are trying
to pull some trick.)

484
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,540
All right. We'd like to buy this.

485
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,150
(The letters on the menu are small,
and he can't find cookies.)

486
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,220
Suk Jin, they're selling this.

487
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,780
But we have to pick
something on the menu.

488
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,650
Let's figure out a way to buy this.

489
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,520
Hey, they're behind us.

490
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,820
- They are watching.
- They are watching us now.

491
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,020
- Okay.
- All right.

492
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,290
(They give up quickly
after hesitating a little.)

493
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,550
I think there's
another store in here.

494
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,970
Should we go in there?

495
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,640
- You want something sweet, right?
- Yes.

496
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,930
Why do they want to eat bread?

497
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,770
We have to go bowling now.

498
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,350
- Right.
- We're running late.

499
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,750
We should hurry and go bowling.

500
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,720
(While Team Suk Jin is
looking for some dessert...)

501
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,270
- That's...
- That's Bus 841.

502
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,990
That goes to Mok-dong though.
It's five.

503
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,350
(The lucky number: 5)

504
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,450
You will take a bus
that includes five...

505
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,050
- and get off at the fifth station.
- Okay.

506
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,150
- It's coming now.
- It's Bus 503.

507
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,360
All right. The race begins now.

508
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,690
Are you sure this is the beginning?

509
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,570
- What if we come back again?
- This is the beginning.

510
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,720
Are you sure?

511
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,400
If we win this race,
it will be really thrilling.

512
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,640
- He's right.
- It will be so thrilling.

513
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,000
You never know.

514
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,310
(They plan to turn the tables slowly,
but diligently.)

515
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,440
Right. The bus needs to stop.

516
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,900
Right. It was weird before.

517
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,440
That bus never stopped.

518
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,410
It's not a bus until it stops.

519
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,410
I used to eat a lot here
with Suk Jin when I was a newbie.

520
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,410
Where?

521
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,360
I went to all those restaurants
with Suk Jin.

522
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
Really?

523
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,680
You have a lot of memories
with Suk Jin.

524
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,360
Yes,
because I didn't have many friends.

525
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,660
There's a good
buckwheat noodle restaurant.

526
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,490
- I want buckwheat noodles.
- That's a famous restaurant.

527
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,160
- The buckwheat noodle restaurant.
- I like buckwheat noodles.

528
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,660
It's right around the corner.

529
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,040
We're getting off at the next stop.

530
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,430
Do you want to go there?

531
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,610
- Yes.
- Good.

532
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,670
The next stop is
Yeouido Sibeom Apartment.

533
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,740
Sibeom Apartment.
Do we get off here?

534
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
(Finally, it's the fifth bus stop.)

535
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,780
Let's get off here.

536
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,550
- Let's get off here.
- Scan your card.

537
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,710
I did.

538
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,320
I can't get away from Yeouido today.

539
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,910
The pit of Yeouido.

540
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,250
Exactly. I can't get away from here.

541
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,250
- The pit of Yeouido.
- I can't stay away from it today.

542
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,720
We're still in Yeouido
after five stops?

543
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,190
Last time,
we got to Gimpo after one stop.

544
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,990
- Jae Suk. We got here from there.
- But last time,

545
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,030
we got to Gimpo after a single stop.

546
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,260
Look, So Min.

547
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,800
We came from there.

548
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,310
We're still in Yeouido
after five stops?

549
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,430
Jae Suk. Will it end before today?

550
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,540
What? We're almost there.

551
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,670
- I can't believe we're here.
- This place is really good.

552
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,080
- Is it famous?
- Their udon is really good too.

553
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,050
Fishcake meal is number one.

554
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,470
- Fishcake meal.
- Fishcake meal is number one.

555
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,360
Udon is fifth.
Gimbap is eighth. It's not bad.

556
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,210
I want the buckwheat noodle combo.

557
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,950
This place is known
for its buckwheat noodles.

558
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,250
- Look at the number.
- Let me draw it.

559
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,750
But the buckwheat noodles...

560
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,830
It's a buckwheat noodle restaurant.

561
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,800
We have to have
buckwheat noodles here.

562
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,430
This is crazy.

563
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,660
You don't need to draw it.

564
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,340
- Right?
- It's five right now.

565
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,200
We could try
the spicy buckwheat noodles.

566
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,810
It's the fifth if you go horizontal.

567
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,940
- One, two, three, four, five.
- Can we do that?

568
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,780
Wait. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

569
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,080
It's gimbap again.

570
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,410
- Gimbap is always the eighth.
- Yes.

571
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,510
Whether I go horizontal or vertical.

572
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,820
The owner was smart with the menu.

573
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,480
- He was smart.
- It's a bingo.

574
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,890
Whichever we go, it's always gimbap.

575
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,630
Whether we go horizontal or vertical,
it's always gimbap.

576
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,130
- It's hilarious.
- Hello.

577
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,570
Hello.

578
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,900
- Thank you.
- Hello.

579
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,870
- Let's sit here.
- It's been a long time.

580
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,900
We'll get
three spicy buckwheat noodles.

581
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,230
- Three spicy buckwheat noodles?
- Yes.

582
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,580
- Spicy?
- Yes, spicy.

583
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,640
- Okay.
- That's all we can get.

584
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,650
- That's all we can get.
- That's all we can get.

585
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,410
She was curious
why we were getting spicy noodles.

586
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,010
Because that's not
the signature menu.

587
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,210
You have to try
the buckwheat noodles here.

588
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,680
How many buckwheat noodles?

589
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,710
- Three.
- Three buckwheat noodles?

590
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,060
Spicy.

591
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,390
It's not spicy.

592
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,220
- That wasn't spicy.
- I wanted it.

593
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,460
- It's here.
- Thank you.

594
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,690
Can you smell it?

595
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,190
It smells so nice.

596
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,660
I'm glad we had a good number.

597
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,730
Yes.

598
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,810
(The sweet and sour spicy
buckwheat noodles...)

599
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,810
(make up for their sufferings.)

600
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,850
It's good.

601
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,940
- It's good.
- It's really good.

602
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,480
Ma'am. This place was always good.

603
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,920
I can cheer up now.

604
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,630
Let's win.

605
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,750
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

606
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,490
There must be a bakery.

607
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,830
- There's one for sure.
- There must be one.

608
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,430
- Egg and bacon. Here.
- Good.

609
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,340
- Here.
- Let's get some bread.

610
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,230
Please.

611
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,200
- There is bread.
- Finally we found the bakery.

612
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,500
Let's get bread.

613
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,670
The eighth bread.

614
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,900
- Eighth bread horizontally.
- They'll decide it.

615
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,410
What's the first bread?

616
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,510
- We can only get the eighth bread.
- What?

617
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,150
- We can only get the eighth bread.
- Eighth?

618
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,510
Is this number one?

619
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,010
This is number one?

620
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,720
No. This should be number one.

621
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,180
- Isn't this number one?
- This should be number one.

622
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,650
Here.

623
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,760
- Is this number one?
- Yes.

624
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,340
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

625
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,400
- Done.
- This one.

626
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,160
- This is not bad.
- I like this bread.

627
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,500
- Good.
- It's nice.

628
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,000
Let's go. This is awesome.

629
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,440
- Finally, we got what we wanted.
- One.

630
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,650
Two.

631
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,580
(One chocolate bread is enough
to make them happy.)

632
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,120
Let's draw eight.

633
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,740
- Let's draw eight.
- And get a cab.

634
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,480
I think we should exit
at the National Cemetry.

635
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,980
(They plan to take Olympic Blvd
and get near Banpo.)

636
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,990
- We need to draw eight.
- If you draw one...

637
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,560
(They must draw 8
to make their plan possible.)

638
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,690
- Can I draw it?
- Yes.

639
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,130
Can you feel it?

640
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,260
No.

641
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,040
(Their fate is up to Se Chan.)

642
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,070
I'll draw it and show you.

643
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,700
(Will it be the lucky number 8?)

644
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,040
I'll draw it and show you.

645
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,110
One, two, three.

646
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,400
- It's eight.
- Okay.

647
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,170
One, two, three.

648
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,440
- It's eight.
- Okay.

649
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,580
(8 gives Team Tortoise a chance
to turn the tables.)

650
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,620
This is awesome.

651
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,910
- We're safe.
- It's one of the three.

652
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,510
- Finally we get to leave Yeouido.
- Finally we can.

653
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,820
How long has it been?
Three? Four hours?

654
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,120
We bought it.

655
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,790
- I can't believe it.
- We somehow bought it.

656
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,060
What did you buy? A cheap one?

657
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,920
- We got the good one.
- Oh, that bread.

658
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,530
- Do you know this place?
- We bought this.

659
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,800
Let's go bowling.

660
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,690
We have to hurry up.
We don't have much time.

661
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,840
We'll run out of time.

662
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,540
Hi.

663
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

664
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,470
- Do you like Running Man?
- Yes.

665
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,740
- So much.
- So much.

666
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,000
- Thank you. Did you run to see us?
- Yes.

667
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,550
Who's your favorite on Running Man?

668
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,350
- I guess it's not us.
- It's not us.

669
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,480
They can't answer me.

670
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,060
- It's here.
- Bye, kids.

671
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,450
- Bye.
- Bye. Take care.

672
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,150
(When it was getting awkward,
the cab arrives.)

673
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,530
- Hello.
- Hello. Sorry.

674
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

675
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,260
We're going to Apgujeong-dong.

676
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,610
Can you take Olympic Blvd?
We have a mission.

677
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,110
We can only take the cab
for eight minutes.

678
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:36,580
- So can you take the exit nearby?
- Drop us on the way.

679
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,650
(Laughing)

680
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,910
I'm sorry.

681
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,670
- Sir.
- Then I have to check the time.

682
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,050
- You're on our side. Thank you.
- Thank you.

683
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,210
- It'll be 54 minutes.
- Fifty four.

684
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,220
Sir. Imagine you're in this with us.

685
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,830
Please help us.

686
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,800
Does this happen often?

687
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,920
- No.
- I see.

688
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,300
- He's firm.
- It never happens.

689
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,460
- Never?
- It never happened before?

690
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,340
- Never.
- Then you should join us today.

691
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,470
- Okay.
- Please hold my hand.

692
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,880
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

693
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,970
Let's drive together
for eight minutes.

694
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,740
Did you have lunch?

695
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,240
- No, not yet.
- Not yet?

696
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,950
I'm going to take a nap
and watch soccer.

697
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,750
You need to watch soccer.

698
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,180
We had buckwheat noodles.

699
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,330
You should try the other restaurant.

700
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,830
Oh, that restaurant.
That place is good too.

701
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,490
We all made a good reaction.

702
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
- We're cheered up after the meal.
- Yes.

703
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,310
And we're kind
to all kinds of topics.

704
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

705
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,340
I can accept everything
with generosity.

706
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,400
(The buckwheat even makes them
nice people.)

707
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,170
We're finally leaving Yeouido
after five hours.

708
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,900
- We're finally leaving Yeouido.
- Yes.

709
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,820
I can't believe we went to Gimpo.

710
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,510
It's unbelievable.

711
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,740
As long as there's no traffic jam,
we can get to National Cemetery.

712
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,750
- See? There's no traffic.
- There's no traffic at all.

713
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,560
- It's empty.
- We could get far at this rate.

714
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,250
- Of course.
- We could win.

715
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,190
It's time now.

716
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,220
- Look at the time. It's over.
- It's perfect.

717
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,370
It's perfect.

718
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,260
Nice timing.

719
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

720
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,540
- It's awesome.
- Thank you. Take care.

721
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,660
Have a good day.

722
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,610
- Hey.
- We got very far.

723
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,640
We got very far.

724
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,050
- At this rate...
- We got very far.

725
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,240
That was successful.

726
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,210
Let's walk...

727
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,010
towards Banpo.

728
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,320
(Destination)

729
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,980
We're walking to Banpo?

730
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,390
We have no choice.
There's no bus stop.

731
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,390
It's going to be a long walk.

732
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
We have eight.

733
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,100
We should take the bus
and go eight stops.

734
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,570
Okay. Let's go eight stops.

735
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,930
And if we take a cab there,
we'll arrive in eight minutes.

736
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,200
- And we'll go to the karaoke.
- We go.

737
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,400
Sing, take a break,
go and we succeed.

738
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Okay.

739
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,650
We have to walk a lot, don't we?

740
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,150
- To where?
- To Express Bus Terminal.

741
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,590
We don't have to go
all the way there.

742
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,980
There's a bus stop
across the street.

743
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,910
I feel like I'm going around
different neighborhoods today.

744
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,950
(They walk and walk again.)

745
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,750
I'm going around
different neighborhoods.

746
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,330
(But it never ends.)

747
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,950
We're walking so much.

748
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:10,370
It's painful that we can't leave
the neighborhood right away.

749
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,110
(Suddenly singing "Rope of Love")

750
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,540
- Why tie with a rope?
- It's her song.

751
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,850
(The original singer's
concert banner)

752
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,970
- Oh, so love can't leave?
- That's right.

753
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,550
- Tie your love with a rope.
- It's Kim Yong Im's song.

754
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,320
(While singing about tying...)

755
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,950
- So Min.
- Hey.

756
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,920
- Prostate.
- Prostate.

757
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,900
That should be tied too.

758
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,220
- It happened to say prostate.
- Prostate.

759
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,130
Tie the prostate with a rope?

760
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,300
Why did it say prostate
when we were singing the song?

761
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,960
Gosh, today is...

762
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,670
- It's really tough.
- It's tough.

763
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,900
It's so tough.

764
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,150
(Tie with rope)

765
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,320
(So Min must've liked the song.)

766
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,210
- She's...
- She's...

767
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,320
- She has the excitement.
- Yes.

768
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,950
How does the original dance go?

769
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,560
- How does it go?
- You turn around.

770
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,160
(Terrible dancers are
teaching each other.)

771
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,900
- Tie with a rope
- Tie with a rope

772
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,460
(The bad dancer is reacting
to the song.)

773
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,310
(The street troupe is going crazy.)

774
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,620
It sounds like
it's tying the prostate.

775
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,350
My goodness.
Why did the prostate suddenly appear?

776
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,010
Let's go.

777
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,180
Oh, I know this place.

778
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,910
I know this place too.
There's a creek, right?

779
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,830
Look.

780
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,030
- It's that place.
- He's wearing...

781
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,300
only the sleeveless shirt
for his girlfriend.

782
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,600
- That's so cool.
- You're so cool.

783
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,370
- You're so cool.
- You're so cool.

784
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,730
So cool.

785
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,640
- Jae Suk.
- My gosh.

786
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,400
This won't do.
I should take off my shirt.

787
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,170
- I should take off my shirt.
- Now...

788
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,610
- He's so cool.
- So Min.

789
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,740
- Now...
- That's cool.

790
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,550
How cool is that?

791
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,940
He's so cool.

792
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,910
He doesn't care
about what others think.

793
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,710
I know.

794
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,120
He's wearing sleeveless.

795
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,180
- It's December.
- Not to make her hair wet.

796
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,950
- It's almost December.
- To protect her hair.

797
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,060
Now...

798
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,990
He's that romantic
to do that in December?

799
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,190
That's amazing.

800
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,960
I'm so touched.

801
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,300
- Why?
- He's so cool.

802
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,660
Is that possible?

803
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,110
Se Chan.

804
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,610
Do you want me to take my shirt off?

805
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,810
- Isn't it amazing?
- What are you wearing inside?

806
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,810
Gosh.

807
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,280
He was wearing sleeveless.

808
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,470
- That's so cool.
- He put his shirt over her head.

809
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,170
He wrapped her hair perfectly.

810
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,150
- Like a baby.
- He wrapped her hair perfectly.

811
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,620
- Is that love?
- That is love.

812
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,210
Even when we were passing by,

813
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,750
- he didn't react at all.
- No.

814
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,890
- He wasn't distracted.
- He wasn't distracted.

815
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,180
He was so focused.

816
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,300
Jae Suk, is there a bus stop
if we go this way?

817
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,800
No. Go straight.

818
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,100
(They finally arrived at Banpo!)

819
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
Right.

820
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,160
It's over there.

821
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,690
- It's over there, right?
- Yes.

822
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,160
We're finally here.

823
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,610
The 148 bus is coming.
I think it goes to Apgujeong.

824
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,000
- The 148 bus.
- Right.

825
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,700
It says "Apgujeong Station."
We should take this.

826
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,470
We should take 148 bus.

827
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,900
It says "Apgujeong Station."

828
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,440
Then we don't have
to change the number.

829
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,620
No, we don't.

830
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,010
It's 412. Bus 4318 will go there too.
Let me check.

831
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,820
- It's 148.
- As far as I remember...

832
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
Eight.

833
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,680
- One, two, three.
- The one on the top.

834
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,360
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

835
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,060
It stops at Apgujeong.

836
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,100
It goes to Apgujeong.
148 bus is perfect.

837
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,220
We're going to the bank.

838
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,720
We should just go to a karaoke then.

839
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,990
- We're tortoises then.
- What?

840
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,800
- We're tortoises.
- We're tortoises.

841
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,500
- It has come. The 3rd one.
- The 148 bus has come.

842
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,280
Hello. For three people, please.

843
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
For three people, please.

844
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,110
For three people, please.

845
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,010
We can play bowling,
but how can we win?

846
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,910
Those people who come...

847
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,290
- to enjoy bowling...
- Yes.

848
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,450
would be quite good.

849
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,180
- They'll be better than us.
- Right?

850
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,590
Where should we go?

851
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,290
- It's over there.
- It's over there.

852
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,830
The bowling alley is over there.

853
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,990
We finally found it.

854
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,800
It wasn't easy to come here.

855
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,600
It's nice.

856
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,640
- It's nice. Hello.
- Hello.

857
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,810
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

858
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

859
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,700
They look like pros. Hello.

860
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,170
We should play it quickly and go.

861
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,610
- Yes. We don't have time.
- We don't have time.

862
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,850
We should win quickly.

863
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,410
What should we do? We're in trouble.

864
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,750
What should we do?
Should we play eight rounds?

865
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,890
- If you keep number eight,
- Yes.

866
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,950
you should win eight rounds...

867
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,630
against other people.

868
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,830
If it's eight rounds...

869
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,460
Does 1 round
consist of 10 frames and more?

870
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,190
- Yes. That's one round.
- We don't have enough time.

871
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,730
Then you should pick number three.

872
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,500
We should pick number three.

873
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,840
We can win.

874
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,230
Yes. We can do it.

875
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,740
We must pick number three.

876
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,410
- Good.
- He's picking the number.

877
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,740
- Pick one.
- We need number three.

878
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,180
- Three. Please.
- Otherwise, it'll take too long.

879
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,120
(What number did Suk Jin draw?)

880
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
My number. Three.

881
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,890
- Three.
- We got it.

882
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,680
- What?
- Hey.

883
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,900
Wait. Is the difference three?

884
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,650
- Three.
- Is it three?

885
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,100
- So we should play 3 rounds.
- It's 3 rounds.

886
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,800
- Three rounds?
- It's actually long as well.

887
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Let's play three rounds.

888
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,610
Three rounds? Should we call others?

889
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,840
You should find people to play with.

890
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,580
Gosh, this is...

891
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,080
Everyone looks like they'll be good.

892
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,170
I think they will be good.

893
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,810
I think
they're the only other group here.

894
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,210
- We can't. They're good.
- They're good?

895
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,440
- They're too good.
- They're so good.

896
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,590
- We can't do it.
- They're good.

897
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,360
- Are you a professional player?
- I'm a 12th grader.

898
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
- What?
- A 12th grader.

899
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,150
- You're a 12th grader?
- You're a 12th grader?

900
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,180
Are you going to college
with bowling?

901
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,060
- No. It's just a hobby.
- And you're here, not at school.

902
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,150
- Is the class over?
- It's the final exam day.

903
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,530
Try throwing it.

904
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,190
This guy.

905
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,260
- Yes. Let's see how it throws it.
- But we're...

906
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,730
- Let's see what he's got.
- They must've heard we were coming.

907
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,810
Yes. The steps are...

908
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,080
- Okay. Pass.
- This guy...

909
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,080
- Okay. Pass.
- This guy...

910
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,780
Do you want to play a round with us?

911
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,410
If you have time.

912
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,650
Are you okay with that?

913
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,440
- Let's go together.
- Thank you.

914
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,090
This is doable.

915
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,420
Can we play
with two employees here too?

916
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,720
Do you want a 4-on-4?

917
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,600
- Okay. Just one more person.
- Yes.

918
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,330
- One person.
- One person.

919
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,160
We need one more person
to play together.

920
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,460
- One?
- Yes.

921
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,340
Then I'll...

922
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,640
- Okay.
- I'll go then.

923
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,660
(They recruited an employee.)

924
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,970
(He's bringing his own gear.)

925
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,470
- What should I do?
- This is hard.

926
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,350
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

927
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,890
- I work here.
- What's your average score?

928
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,180
I'm not bad.

929
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,590
I think you'll be really good.

930
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,860
No. I'm not good.

931
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,860
Let's do it quickly.

932
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,030
- It's okay if we do it quickly.
- Let's do it. We don't have time.

933
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,030
Let's go.

934
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,390
Should I play first?

935
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,150
- You got 15 minutes...
- They're wearing the same clothes.

936
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,660
- What's that?
- What?

937
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,690
I feel like you're professional.

938
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,230
Right.

939
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,730
Producer, I think we need this rule.

940
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,900
We all should play with the same ball,
not the custom one.

941
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
Right. I don't think it's right.

942
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,340
Suk Jin has custom balls too.

943
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,970
I have custom balls at home.

944
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,500
He even has his own balls.

945
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,200
I have six balls.

946
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,050
Let's talk about it.
Is he allowed to wear it?

947
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,980
- I have many wristbands too.
- He got 100 at home.

948
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,210
But still...

949
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,590
We'll let you do that.

950
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,650
Let's try first.

951
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,990
You will play in lane 15.
They will play in lane 17.

952
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,690
- Okay.
- Got it. I'll go first.

953
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,760
Good luck.

954
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,260
- You got this.
- You got this.

955
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,160
- You got this.
- Okay.

956
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,400
Here I go.

957
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,460
Jong Kook.

958
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,840
That's nice.

959
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,670
- That's good. Turn more.
- Turn.

960
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,440
- It's good. You can make a spare.
- You did well.

961
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,320
It had to go in the middle.

962
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,910
You did well.

963
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,180
Throw it as if it's the first ball.

964
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,210
(Haha tries to make a spare.)

965
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,750
- Hey. He was timid.
- No.

966
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,750
(The ball went sideways.)

967
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,090
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

968
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,860
- In 1, 2, 3. We got this.
- We got this.

969
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,100
No matter what...

970
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,800
- You can play first.
- Okay.

971
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,830
(From Team Citizens,
a student plays first.)

972
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,490
Okay. This guy is so good.

973
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,370
He just threw it.

974
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,610
It was nice.

975
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,430
(He knocked over 9 pins.)

976
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,280
He just threw it.

977
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,000
(What is this?)

978
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,310
- What's this?
- What's this?

979
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,910
For how many years
have you played bowling?

980
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,080
It's not been long.

981
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,210
So how many years?

982
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,350
Since I was an 11th grader.

983
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,290
- Then it's a year. It's a lot.
- It's over a year then.

984
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,620
- So anyone of us can make a spare?
- Yes.

985
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,330
- I hope he does it.
- All right.

986
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,060
- Okay.
- He should do it.

987
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,830
Then I'll throw 1st
for the 2nd frame.

988
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,060
Okay.

989
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,070
It's like a dance.

990
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,490
- What? It's going in.
- He threw it weirdly.

991
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,490
- Okay.
- Okay.

992
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,990
I'm relieved.

993
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,640
- This is it.
- We caught up with them.

994
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,230
Well done. His steps were gentle.

995
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,540
He's good.

996
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,200
I'm not sure if I can make a spare.

997
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,880
I'll throw it for the second time.

998
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,740
- Just throw it to the center.
- Yes.

999
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,320
- To the center.
- You got this.

1000
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
She was good.

1001
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,380
- She threw it too hard.
- She threw it too hard.

1002
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,490
- Not that way.
- Shew threw it too hard.

1003
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,490
Oh, my gosh.

1004
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,590
- Throw it gently.
- It's like the first ball.

1005
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
- It's the first ball, Suk Jin.
- I'm going crazy.

1006
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,950
- Throw it gently.
- Do it gently. That was too hard.

1007
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,450
- Throw it gently.
- I'm in trouble. It'll be fine.

1008
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,900
- Oh, my gosh.
- Gosh.

1009
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,590
Where are you going?

1010
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,070
It's...

1011
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,430
- We can't do it.
- This is us.

1012
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,970
- Let it slide just this once.
- We're this bad.

1013
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,570
So you don't have to go hard.

1014
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,070
I know.

1015
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,680
We're this bad.

1016
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,280
It has to be a close game.

1017
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,840
This is not fun.

1018
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,610
He's left-handed.

1019
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
- No, it won't work.
- It won't work.

1020
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,780
What's going on?

1021
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,090
(What's this?)

1022
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,720
- This is not working. It's no fun.
- It's impossible.

1023
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,590
You should say, "You got this."

1024
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,320
He's a pro.

1025
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,740
- Is this a prank?
- What are we doing?

1026
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,910
- Did you see the spin?
- Are you mocking us?

1027
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,180
- Do it.
- He's a professional.

1028
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,410
Haha, you throw the ball first.

1029
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,510
This is too much.

1030
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,010
Our skills have
to be on the same level.

1031
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,820
- Do it slowly and gently.
- He's so good.

1032
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,720
- There you go. Well done.
- That's nice.

1033
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,840
- It's okay.
- It's good.

1034
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,010
(He knocked over 6 pins.)

1035
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,180
Good luck.

1036
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,030
Why is he throwing it first?

1037
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,430
- We're taking turns.
- We're taking turns.

1038
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,900
I see. But you're a pro.

1039
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,720
What's your name?

1040
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,800
Hong Jin Ho.

1041
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,300
- Jin Ho?
- Jin Ho? How about you?

1042
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,300
I'm Cho Han Jin.

1043
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,590
- Hwan Jin?
- Hwan Jin?

1044
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,110
- And your name is?
- It's Han Jin.

1045
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,160
- Han Jin.
- I'm Park Kyung Shin.

1046
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,180
- Kyung Shin.
- Yes.

1047
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,200
It says Park Kyung Shin
won the game.

1048
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,800
- It went out.
- Last year...

1049
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,410
Hey.

1050
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,570
- Why?
- "King of Bowling Park Kyung Shin."

1051
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,840
- He won.
- "King of Bowling Park Kyung Shin."

1052
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,910
(King of Bowling Park Kyung Shin)

1053
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,110
Are you kidding me?

1054
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,090
What's that?
He's the King of Bowling.

1055
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,050
Be the referee.

1056
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,260
Do you want to play with amateurs?

1057
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,550
That's too much.

1058
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,530
I was just asked to play.

1059
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,160
- You're the King of Bowling.
- What are you doing with kids?

1060
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,200
Last time,
you played at our bowling alley too.

1061
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,610
Really?

1062
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,470
- That's good.
- For "Infinite Challenge..."

1063
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,910
with Kim Soo Hyun.

1064
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,200
- I see.
- Yes.

1065
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,800
I taught him.

1066
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,570
Actor Kim Soo Hyun?

1067
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,010
- Soo Hyun?
- You taught him?

1068
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,110
Yes.

1069
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,490
- This won't do.
- Get out quickly.

1070
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,360
- This is a scam.
- This is too much.

1071
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,590
It's the first game anyway.

1072
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,320
- We'll just give up.
- Yes.

1073
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,760
- Let's give up the first game.
- Yes.

1074
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,160
(It's student Han Jin's turn.)

1075
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,630
Look at him. His steps are so...

1076
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,470
- That was nice.
- You did well.

1077
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,470
- I like you.
- You're good.

1078
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,610
- Han Jin.
- Han Jin.

1079
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,610
- You're one of us.
- I like you.

1080
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,340
Han Jin has a good personality.

1081
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,650
Throw it comfortably.
Don't throw it hard.

1082
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,410
- There you go.
- That was nice.

1083
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,470
- It went to that side.
- It's okay.

1084
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,610
You can make a spare.
This is the first ball. We never know.

1085
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,740
We got 21 points.

1086
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,910
The posture is...

1087
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,950
- And they got 34 points.
- This is...

1088
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,220
Kyung Shin.

1089
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,900
- You came to play with kids.
- Sir.

1090
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,800
The King of Bowling.

1091
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,490
So he's standing diagonally
like that.

1092
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,800
I think it will go in the gutter.

1093
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,200
- Get out.
- Come on.

1094
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,970
- Get out.
- Come on.

1095
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,150
- What's this?
- What's this?

1096
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,280
(What's this?)

1097
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,450
- What's this?
- What are you doing with newbies?

1098
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,240
Why did a professional player come?

1099
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,880
Then I'll throw the ball
with the other hand next time.

1100
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Okay.

1101
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,910
- Yes.
- With your right hand?

1102
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,990
- Your right hand?
- Yes.

1103
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,380
- Are you right-handed?
- No. I'm left-handed.

1104
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,050
- Are you left-handed?
- Yes.

1105
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,160
I really can't throw it
with my right hand.

1106
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,400
- You can't? Okay.
- No.

1107
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,900
(How good is the King of Bowling
with his right hand?)

1108
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,530
- What?
- What?

1109
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,760
He threw it in a weird way.

1110
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,660
What are you doing?

1111
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,360
(He said he wasn't good
with his right hand.)

1112
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,380
I threw it with my right hand.

1113
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,380
You didn't even put your thumb...

1114
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
- into the hole.
- You're right.

1115
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,950
He didn't even put his thumb in the hole.
Did you see that?

1116
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,010
It's a trend these days.

1117
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,280
- They don't use their thumb?
- Just the middle and ring fingers.

1118
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,180
- It's a trend these days?
- Yes.

1119
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,510
- Then I should follow it.
- Yes.

1120
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,880
Do people actually throw it
like this?

1121
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Yes. It's called thumbless bowling.

1122
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,820
It's a popular style these days.

1123
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,950
- So the ball spins like that.
- Yes.

1124
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,700
- Hey.
- Gosh.

1125
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,760
(Strike)

1126
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,090
- Nice.
- You go in.

1127
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,970
This is...

1128
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,400
Hey.

1129
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,010
Don't do this.

1130
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,010
You should think about us too.

1131
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,570
Han Jin,
go with the thumbless style.

1132
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,110
- Han Jin, you can do it.
- One, two.

1133
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,180
- Good.
- It went in.

1134
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,550
- Nice.
- It went in.

1135
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,990
(Even the bad one got better now.)

1136
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,050
Hey.

1137
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,490
- Get it together.
- What's wrong?

1138
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,660
What is it?
Why are you so good suddenly?

1139
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,910
This is not like you.

1140
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,360
This is not like you.

1141
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,760
They're good.

1142
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,930
Team Citizens won round one.

1143
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,160
- But...
- It's so...

1144
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,430
he's not a regular citizen.

1145
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,740
- He's...
- He's not a regular citizen.

1146
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,200
- He's so good.
- He's the King of Bowling.

1147
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
He's a professional.
You can't do this.

1148
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,780
It says
"King of Bowling" over there.

1149
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,950
It says
"King of Bowling Park Kyung Shin."

1150
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,510
Let's go to a karaoke
near Apgujeong Station.

1151
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,180
(Team Jae Suk is going
to Apgujeong by the 148 bus.)

1152
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,450
It's near exit four
of Apgujeong Station.

1153
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,680
- Let me see.
- There's one.

1154
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,720
Here.

1155
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,530
The dentist
I go to is right in front of here.

1156
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,380
I should get my braces.

1157
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,490
Jae Suk. Hold on.

1158
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,660
- Why? Do you want to go there?
- We're going down anyway.

1159
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,400
- I'll get my braces real quick.
- He wants to stop by the dentist.

1160
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,160
Your braces?

1161
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,430
Do you still wear braces?
When will you be done?

1162
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,800
- Are you wearing braces?
- Let me see your teeth.

1163
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,280
Your teeth are...
Are you still wearing braces?

1164
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,450
Gosh.

1165
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,800
- I'm...
- Are you wearing braces?

1166
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,950
I was done.

1167
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,510
That's the most unexpected news
I heard in the past year.

1168
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,280
- You're still wearing them?
- I was done.

1169
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,590
But because I didn't
wear braces often,

1170
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,930
- my teeth started to go back.
- I see.

1171
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,030
That's why I'm doing it again.

1172
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,900
When will you be done?

1173
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,220
It'll be over soon.
I should just go to the dentist twice.

1174
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,360
So is this the final look?

1175
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,760
Is it the final look?

1176
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,570
It's not perfect,
but I'm very satisfied.

1177
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,660
(It's surprisingly
the best they can do.)

1178
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,340
This stop is Kookmin Bank,
Apgujeong Station.

1179
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,510
It's here.

1180
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,800
- We should get off.
- We're there.

1181
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,970
Thank you.

1182
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,380
- Bye.
- Thank you.

1183
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,010
(After going to Gimpo,
they came a long way to get to Apgujeong.)

1184
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,280
- We're in Apgujeong.
- So...

1185
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,280
we should go there, right?
It's behind the building.

1186
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,410
- It's your neighborhood.
- Yes.

1187
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,090
It's my neighborhood.

1188
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,530
- Jae Suk...
- Do you walk around here?

1189
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,780
- I walk around here.
- He's walking around...

1190
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,050
with a mask and a cap.

1191
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,160
I walk around
pretty much everywhere here.

1192
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,430
I think people pretend
not to recognize him.

1193
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,630
- It's obviously him.
- They don't recognize me.

1194
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,070
- No. It's so obvious.
- Not with a mask.

1195
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,970
- Jae Suk and I...
- Look.

1196
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,530
Do you know which body part
they recognize?

1197
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,780
Our mouths.

1198
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,570
Because it's my neighborhood,
if I have a shoot in this area,

1199
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,450
Kyung Eun's acquaintances
text her immediately.

1200
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,450
Really?

1201
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,320
- Yes. Many of them are here.
- So your wife knows immediately.

1202
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,680
(It's a real-time report system.)

1203
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,220
- I'm sorry.
- Hanam Pig House. It's over there.

1204
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,180
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh. It's Yoo Jae Suk.

1205
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,630
Yes. Hello.

1206
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,430
(As soon as he said it,
the report system is activated.)

1207
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,860
- It's here.
- It's here.

1208
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,860
This is the karaoke.

1209
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,160
- It's here.
- Yes. Dudeurim.

1210
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
Okay.

1211
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,700
We suddenly came to a karaoke,
leaving Yeoui Island.

1212
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,110
- It's so...
- We went everywhere.

1213
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,110
From Gimpo to here...

1214
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,180
It sounds like the title of a trot song.
"From Gimpo To Apgujeong."

1215
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

1216
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,240
Well...

1217
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,550
- We should drink the 8th one.
- The 8th one.

1218
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,150
- It's 1, 2, 3, 4...
- No.

1219
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,550
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1220
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,780
- It's beer.
- It's beer.

1221
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,320
How about in the other way?
One, two, three, four...

1222
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,530
- five, six, seven...
- I want to drink this one.

1223
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,950
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1224
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,720
It's the same this way. One, two...

1225
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,930
(He keeps counting numbers
in front of the fridge.)

1226
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,220
Seven, eight. This is it.

1227
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,400
I want to have this one.

1228
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,030
Do you want this one? Then...

1229
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,470
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1230
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,570
- It works.
- It works.

1231
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,130
- It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1232
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,300
This works, right? It makes sense.

1233
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,910
- It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1234
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,950
- We count numbers like this.
- Yes.

1235
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,110
- It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1236
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,260
It works.

1237
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,490
(It works!)

1238
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,880
(They got coffee like that.)

1239
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,930
We should get 80 points.

1240
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,360
Oh, my. Now, it feels better.

1241
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,300
- What did you get? Coffee?
- Coffee.

1242
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,490
Is it latte?

1243
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,030
- Yes.
- We had no choice.

1244
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,570
I should sing "Emergency Room"
after a long time.

1245
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,530
- Your current number is eight.
- Okay.

1246
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,910
- Your score should be 80 to 89.
- From 80 to 89.

1247
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,780
- We pass then, right?
- From 80 to 89?

1248
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,050
- Hey.
- It's hot.

1249
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,650
Let's sing something
we'll get 80 to 89 points with.

1250
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,380
There is definitely
a song like that.

1251
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,110
What's this? "Cleo?"

1252
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:12,490
("Good Time" by Cleo)

1253
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,610
Is this the right song?

1254
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,430
(She starts singing
without hesitation.)

1255
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,260
(She likes going to a karaoke alone
and this is her go-to karaoke song.)

1256
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,930
(Why is she doing this?)

1257
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,090
So Min...

1258
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,260
It's the last song she sings
when she's with her crush.

1259
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,260
- The ending song.
- The ending song.

1260
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,630
"With you."

1261
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,180
Look at the lyrics.

1262
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,740
(I want to stay with you tonight)

1263
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,380
(I need permission from my parents)

1264
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,550
(But tonight
I want to spend with you)

1265
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,490
(She doesn't give up singing
even after singing off tune.)

1266
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,550
Let's go.

1267
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,300
- Go.
- One, two, three.

1268
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,630
(Co-ed band Frog and Protruded Brothers
is formed.)

1269
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,260
(Sub vocalist and dancer)

1270
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,200
(Main vocalist and center)

1271
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,070
(I want to spend)

1272
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,110
(The main vocalist's forte
is singing off tune.)

1273
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,410
- It's over.
- It's over.

1274
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,650
(What are the scores?)

1275
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,860
- Let's get 80. Look at this.
- What?

1276
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,160
- Well...
- I was really bad.

1277
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,950
- No. Jae Suk.
- I was really bad.

1278
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,220
No. You should not have a hint
of excitement in your voice.

1279
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,760
I should've sung it even worse.

1280
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,760
- Jae Suk, do you want me to do it?
- You do it.

1281
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,700
It was close.

1282
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,070
(Team Jae Suk seems to understand
the scoring system after a song.)

1283
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,800
You should sing worse than this.

1284
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,990
- What are you going to sing?
- I should sing a song...

1285
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,430
that I will get just 80 points.

1286
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,570
He's a professional.
You can't do this.

1287
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,180
It says
"King of Bowling" over there.

1288
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,680
- It says "King of Bowling,"
- We can't play against him.

1289
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,680
"Park Kyung Shin."

1290
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,950
- Then...
- Yes.

1291
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,320
- Instead of the total score,
- Yes.

1292
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,050
- if you play a 1-on-1 game...
- Yes.

1293
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,680
- and get higher scores than him...
- We should win?

1294
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,050
just three times.

1295
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,550
- Okay.
- Just three times.

1296
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,760
Playing a 1-on-1 game?

1297
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,280
- So we should win 3 out of 10.
- Okay.

1298
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,130
- I got it.
- It sounds good. We can do it.

1299
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,590
- Let's begin now.
- Yes.

1300
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,360
- Get higher scores 3 times. Yes.
- Out of 10.

1301
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,300
You don't have to bend too much.

1302
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,990
- I can just drop the ball.
- Yes. Just do it gently.

1303
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,360
Like you're shaking hands.

1304
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,570
- Shaking hands?
- Yes.

1305
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,470
- Like I'm shaking hands?
- To spin the ball.

1306
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,240
- We got this. It's the last time.
- It's the last time. Let's go.

1307
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,700
I'll do it.

1308
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,180
It's a practice.

1309
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,010
(He practices throwing a ball
as he learned.)

1310
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,180
That's nice.

1311
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:23,880
That's how you do it.

1312
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,990
That's right.

1313
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,340
- This is it.
- Yes.

1314
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,280
- This is much easier.
- Yes.

1315
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,160
- And you won't get hurt either.
- I won't get hurt either.

1316
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,300
- That's why many people do this.
- Is there a professional...

1317
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,050
thumbless bowler?

1318
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,400
- There are a lot.
- There are a lot?

1319
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:40,160
Even professional players
do it like that with two hands.

1320
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,470
- Two hands?
- Yes.

1321
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,240
- Jong Kook should go first.
- I'll go first.

1322
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,260
- If you win three times, it's over.
- Yes.

1323
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,680
We should decide
on the order wisely.

1324
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,300
- You got this.
- Here I go.

1325
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,300
(Jong Kook starts first.)

1326
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,300
Okay.

1327
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,970
Let's go.

1328
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,610
- My gosh.
- That's nice.

1329
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,220
- That's nice. It's done.
- That's nice. It went to it.

1330
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,490
Darn it.

1331
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,860
- That's nice. It's done.
- That's nice. It went to it.

1332
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,090
Darn it.

1333
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,550
- It's always the middle one.
- It's so annoying.

1334
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,130
It's always the middle one
that is left.

1335
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,590
- That one pin.
- I'm going crazy. I'm frustrated.

1336
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,800
Let's just win three times.

1337
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,070
- I'll make it go in.
- Han Jin.

1338
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,900
You're going to do it first, right?

1339
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,090
- He'll go first.
- No. I'll go first.

1340
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,740
Aren't you trying too hard to win?

1341
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,110
No, I'm not.

1342
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,510
- Let's make a spare first.
- Yes.

1343
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,760
Let's go with the spare.

1344
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,430
(Jong Kook tries to make a spare.)

1345
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,470
- It's good.
- It's sliding.

1346
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:24,550
- Go in.
- It slid.

1347
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,180
- It slid.
- What's wrong?

1348
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,680
That's nine.

1349
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,380
What's wrong with me?

1350
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,880
(Jong Kook, 9)

1351
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,110
- That was close.
- I'm usually good at it.

1352
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,720
Park Kyung Shin.

1353
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,160
(He uses the other hand again.)

1354
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,360
(He already knocked over 9 pins.)

1355
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,570
That one is hard.

1356
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,300
Look at that.

1357
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,930
- It's easy. The one at the end.
- You can't do this.

1358
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,160
That's the easiest one.

1359
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,260
That was nine, so we could be tied.

1360
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,530
Right. We could be tied.

1361
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,910
Come on.

1362
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,180
Come on.

1363
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,340
- Okay.
- Okay.

1364
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:03,990
- We're tied.
- But it doesn't matter.

1365
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,090
- A tie or a loss...
- It's nothing.

1366
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:10,450
If we're tied 3 times,
let's make it 1 win.

1367
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,630
- It's related to number three.
- Right. That sounds good.

1368
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:14,820
If we're tied three times.

1369
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,590
Okay. We'll approve it.
If you're tied three times,

1370
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,160
- it's one win.
- Thank you.

1371
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,030
(They agreed to consider
3 ties as 1 win.)

1372
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,610
(Seok Sam who learned a new skill
is up.)

1373
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,760
You should do it.

1374
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,570
You must do it.

1375
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,800
(Will he be able to do it well
just like when he practiced?)

1376
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:35,820
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin. What's...

1377
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,320
What's wrong with you?

1378
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,740
I learned it,
but I didn't master it.

1379
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,010
(Seok Sam is bad
at the actual game.)

1380
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:42,010
- Choose a lighter one.
- This is light.

1381
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,880
How should I...

1382
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,950
(New ones)

1383
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,950
Don't rush it.

1384
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,530
Just...

1385
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,200
Okay.

1386
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,660
Okay.

1387
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:56,930
- No way.
- I still managed to get nine.

1388
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:57,970
Is this how you do it?

1389
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,430
Get nine and you'll tie.

1390
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,780
You've got this.

1391
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,410
I've gotten the hang of it now.

1392
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,680
(Suk Jin versus Jin Ho)

1393
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,110
All right. Just get nine for now.

1394
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,950
Okay!

1395
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,280
As long as he misses the spare...

1396
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,820
I'll win this frame
if he only gets one.

1397
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,800
- Please.
- Please.

1398
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,360
(Suk Jin versus Jin Ho)

1399
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,430
- Okay. I tied.
- Good.

1400
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,340
(0 wins, 2 draws)

1401
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,610
We tied twice.

1402
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,200
Two draws.

1403
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,570
- I'm up next.
- You?

1404
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,610
(It's the Little One's turn.)

1405
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:36,780
I tied.

1406
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,050
- Still...
- Han Jin's next, right?

1407
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,510
Yes.

1408
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:43,840
I'm going to beat him.

1409
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,160
- Good!
- Darn it.

1410
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,130
- Nice. That was good.
- It's fine.

1411
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,400
Why won't it swerve
toward the middle?

1412
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,550
You might be able to land this.

1413
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,990
It's doable.

1414
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,900
There's always an option to tie.

1415
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,340
Three draws are worth a win.

1416
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,510
(Haha's 2nd attempt)

1417
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,530
He's got it.

1418
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,700
- It looks good.
- Looking good!

1419
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,680
You got it.

1420
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,700
Darn it!

1421
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,880
(Haha gets 9 in total.)

1422
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,950
- It's all right. You did well.
- You got nine.

1423
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,050
Nine...

1424
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,720
- Han Jin's beatable.
- Han Jin!

1425
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,720
It'll be hard
for him to get more than nine.

1426
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,760
Send it right down the middle...

1427
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,160
- Look at that.
- It's off course.

1428
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,820
- It's off course.
- Okay, good.

1429
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,900
(He gets 6 on his 1st roll.)

1430
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,760
- You might win this frame.
- You'll win.

1431
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,990
You've got this.

1432
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,630
- We'll get a win.
- Don't try too hard.

1433
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,530
Han Jin, you have a wedgie.

1434
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,880
- What?
- Sorry about that.

1435
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,780
I couldn't help myself.

1436
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,840
(He plays dirty against a teenager.)

1437
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,840
- Oh, no.
- Okay!

1438
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,340
Okay!

1439
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,490
- We're good.
- Okay!

1440
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,550
(Haha wins.)

1441
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,950
That's one. We won one frame.

1442
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,160
- Good job.
- Thanks, Han Jin.

1443
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,430
You have 1 win and 2 draws.

1444
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,660
We have 1 win and 2 draws.

1445
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,950
We can't afford to lose anymore.

1446
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,130
They've suddenly gotten better.

1447
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,550
Nicely done.

1448
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,090
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

1449
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,360
Here I go.

1450
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,660
We can't afford to lose anymore.

1451
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,160
Okay, looking good.

1452
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,200
- It's always so close.
- Not again.

1453
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,880
- This time...
- I'll earn a spare.

1454
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,880
- This...
- We only need one win,

1455
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,880
and you're almost there.

1456
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,840
I'll get it done.

1457
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,780
Just roll it like you don't care.

1458
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,740
There. We're good.

1459
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,380
- This will work.
- You'll get this.

1460
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,760
Nicely done.

1461
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,880
(He earns a spare.)

1462
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,590
Good shot, nice shot.

1463
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,030
- Nice.
- Okay!

1464
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,720
I couldn't get it to spin earlier.

1465
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,220
- This is who we must beat.
- The clock is still ticking.

1466
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,240
We're good as long
as we win this frame.

1467
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,760
Winning this frame
will get us to three wins.

1468
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,300
(Team Suk Jin
is close to completing the mission.)

1469
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,980
(Jong Kook versus Jin Ho)

1470
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,020
- What?
- Please don't let it be a strike.

1471
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,080
(Strike!)

1472
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,190
Nice!

1473
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,350
- They tied.
- It's a tie.

1474
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,390
- Who's next?
- Okay.

1475
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,750
- Unbelievable.
- Did you have to score a strike?

1476
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,270
- If we had won...
- Why you...

1477
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,190
You'll grow up
to be a fine young man.

1478
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:10,830
After what it took to score a spare.

1479
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,770
- You did well.
- It's all right though.

1480
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,270
(Seok Sam's up next.)

1481
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,310
He has lost his touch.

1482
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,540
He knocked down a lot though.

1483
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,620
It's not so bad.

1484
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,520
(Seok Sam's ball
keeps finding the gutter.)

1485
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,850
You know, I've gotten used to...

1486
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,580
- I see.
- not putting in my thumb.

1487
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,520
Hold it with the thumb, then.

1488
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,620
Like shaking hands.

1489
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,620
- I think you got it.
- Wait.

1490
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,100
- Please.
- It won't hit.

1491
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,290
That's seven in total.

1492
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,620
- You've got this.
- Suk Jin.

1493
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:42,460
This isn't the time for training.
It's your time to prove yourself.

1494
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,040
- You know what I mean, right?
- Should I switch grips?

1495
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,100
Yes, go back to your original grip.

1496
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,080
You're supposed to prove yourself,
not train and learn.

1497
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,440
- Don't you get that?
- All right.

1498
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,980
(Meanwhile, Team Jae Suk
needs an eighty-something score.)

1499
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,040
("Jintobaegi" by Lee Chan Won)

1500
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,410
Let's get a score in the 80s.

1501
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,460
He's been correcting his teeth.

1502
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,120
Se Chan has been
correcting his teeth.

1503
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,830
(Let's party.)

1504
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,520
Here we go.

1505
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,770
Don't sing it too well.

1506
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:33,410
(Jintobaegi)

1507
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,790
(He's in the zone.)

1508
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,600
(He sings passionately...)

1509
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,960
(despite saying
that they shouldn't party.)

1510
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,230
(What's their score?)

1511
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,230
- Cut the song.
- Okay.

1512
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,460
- All right.
- What's the score?

1513
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,770
- It's too high.
- What?

1514
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,000
(Mr. Straight Teeth
gets a score of 95.)

1515
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,270
- Let's not party.
- Don't sing too passionately.

1516
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,520
You got a score of 95.

1517
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,850
Let's not party, okay?

1518
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,480
Don't sing too passionately.
Unbelievable.

1519
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,580
- Jae Suk.
- You're liking this way too much.

1520
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,890
I'm having a blast.

1521
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:14,480
- She's the best.
- I'm having the best time.

1522
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,890
This is the best.

1523
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,750
Seeing So Min having fun
is cracking me up.

1524
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,160
What are you going to sing?

1525
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,960
"At Andong Station."

1526
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,230
- Good.
- That's a good one.

1527
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,040
I'll sing in a way
that'll get me 80 points.

1528
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,460
("At Andong Station" by Jin Sung)

1529
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:32,750
(A hat performance)

1530
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,350
(Toot-toot)

1531
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,250
(Toot-toot)

1532
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,520
Let's do this.

1533
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,730
(The Yoo San Seul train
leaves the station.)

1534
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,160
Let's go to Andong Station!

1535
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,210
My singing is way too good.

1536
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,270
(He forgets about the score
and sings while in the zone.)

1537
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:14,910
(His nasal voice comes through.)

1538
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,120
Jae Suk,
you're singing it way too well.

1539
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:18,560
Okay, let's do this.

1540
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,730
- Hurry.
- We're running out of time.

1541
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,120
We only have two frames left.

1542
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,330
You need at least win once
or tie once.

1543
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,460
(They must win or draw one frame
to get 3 wins in total.)

1544
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,430
One win or draw. That's doable.

1545
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,060
All right.

1546
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,770
- In 1, 2...
- Get a strike, Jong Kook.

1547
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:31,790
(Team Suk Jin's best bowler
Jong Kook)

1548
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,660
- Looking good!
- Please go off course.

1549
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,940
Get a strike, Jong Kook.

1550
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,230
- Looking good!
- Please go off course.

1551
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,410
- Oh, no.
- It's going down the center.

1552
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,180
- No!
- It's a split!

1553
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,680
- No!
- It's a split!

1554
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,870
- That's the trickiest.
- What a relief.

1555
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,270
It was dead in the center.

1556
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:47,040
- Isn't that the trickiest?
- It requires a spin.

1557
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,460
- The pins...
- It'll be hard to get a spare.

1558
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,810
- This is impossible.
- The pins will have to ricochet.

1559
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:51,810
That's right.

1560
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,020
Like billiards.
A pin must take out other pins.

1561
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:56,060
This is a tough shot.

1562
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,560
- Nothing's easy in life.
- I had such a good chance.

1563
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,140
This is a tough shot,

1564
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,830
so just go for the pins on one side.
Will it go down the center?

1565
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,210
- No.
- It shouldn't.

1566
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:09,600
- He got 2, so that's 8 in total.
- We only need 9.

1567
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,640
(He managed to take out
2 more pins.)

1568
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,080
(If the citizens get more than 9,
they'll move on to the next frame.)

1569
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,600
Getting nine isn't that easy.

1570
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,710
- Scoring nine points isn't easy.
- What's his name again?

1571
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,310
- Jin Ho.
- Jin Ho?

1572
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,290
Jin Ho!

1573
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,080
(Jong Kook versus Jin Ho)

1574
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,890
- Head for the gutter!
- Don't!

1575
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,430
- Oh, no.
- Okay.

1576
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,330
(Jong Kook versus Jin Ho)

1577
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,390
- Nice.
- This isn't so bad.

1578
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:31,020
- It's not bad.
- He'll go for the three.

1579
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,120
- Aim for the three pins.
- This isn't so bad.

1580
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,270
Send it down the middle.

1581
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,890
You must knock down
those three pins.

1582
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:37,060
You can't afford to miss.

1583
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,390
(Team Suk Jin will win
if he can't take out more than 3.)

1584
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,710
- Get only one.
- We could tie.

1585
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:40,940
Jin Ho, just get the one.

1586
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,640
This is the time to gamble.
Aim for the three.

1587
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,730
- We can tie to win.
- I bet he's nervous right now.

1588
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,000
- Just get one pin.
- I bet you're nervous.

1589
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,080
Aren't you nervous?

1590
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,910
- I bet you're nervous.
- The gutter couldn't seem wider.

1591
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,080
- I bet you are.
- Oh, no.

1592
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,250
It's heading for the gutter.

1593
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,940
- I bet you're nervous.
- The gutter couldn't seem wider.

1594
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,520
- I bet you are.
- Oh, no.

1595
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,790
(Jong Kook versus Jin Ho)

1596
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,830
(Will he only get 2?)

1597
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:00,850
It's heading the other way.

1598
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,560
(He manages to strike 3.)

1599
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,850
(Darn it!)

1600
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:06,100
- Are you kidding me?
- Seriously?

1601
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,100
I can't believe he made the shot!

1602
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,370
(That was so close.)

1603
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,870
I was too excited just now.

1604
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,230
- I...
- Darn it.

1605
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,600
- You.
- Hey.

1606
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:16,140
You scored a strike earlier
when we could've tied and now...

1607
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,710
I doubt you're normally this good.

1608
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:18,750
(They must play the final frame.)

1609
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,870
I'm going back
to the grip I'm used to.

1610
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,310
I must prove myself,
not spend this time to train.

1611
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,180
- Twelve pounds.
- Stick to your usual grip.

1612
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,890
The twelve-pound ball is mine.

1613
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:31,350
(If they fail,
they must begin all over again.)

1614
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,160
Okay!

1615
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,250
Let's do this.

1616
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,290
Good.

1617
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:39,060
(He holds the ball
with his usual grip...)

1618
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,870
(and bowls.)

1619
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,730
- This...
- You've gotten used to it.

1620
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,040
- Darn it.
- You've gotten used to it.

1621
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,940
(Team Suk Jin knows
that they might lose.)

1622
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,180
It was a close game.

1623
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,310
- Just one.
- Let me win this frame.

1624
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:53,410
- I could score a spare.
- Of course.

1625
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,770
I could score a spare.

1626
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:56,770
Of course.

1627
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,140
Do it comfortably.
Push it straight. That's right.

1628
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,120
- That's right.
- Great.

1629
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,080
(Will it go well?)

1630
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,620
Do it comfortably.
Push it straight. That's right.

1631
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,750
- That's right.
- Great.

1632
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,500
(He scored a spare.)

1633
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,540
Great!

1634
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,960
(Ji Seok Sam proved himself!)

1635
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,140
(They got 3 wins!)

1636
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,370
I told you. It went in.

1637
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,250
You succeeded in getting 3 wins!

1638
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,480
Okay!

1639
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,250
The final one went in.

1640
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,690
What a relief. Thank you.

1641
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,790
Great job.

1642
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,060
Thank you.

1643
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,330
- Great work.
- You taught me briefly but well.

1644
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:40,750
- You taught me briefly but well.
- Good work.

1645
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,690
It was difficult.

1646
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:43,890
Thank you so much.

1647
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,560
- Good work.
- Thank you.

1648
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,190
You completed the mission.

1649
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:51,460
The other team already picked
their mission.

1650
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,060
- Really?
- So...

1651
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,770
- there's only one mission left.
- Okay.

1652
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,440
If we succeed this one and move,
we win, right?

1653
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,770
- Yes.
- What will it be?

1654
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,080
(What mission is left?)

1655
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,180
What is it?

1656
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,140
(Team Suk Jin read their mission.)

1657
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,210
We can do that before the ending,
right?

1658
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:10,290
- That's right.
- Yes.

1659
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,890
Let's go to Apgujeong first.

1660
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,580
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1661
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,620
It arrives in seven minutes.

1662
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,330
I don't think we'll make it.

1663
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:19,390
(Team Jae Suk and Team Suk Jin)

1664
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:25,870
(Team Jae Suk is still trying
to get a high score.)

1665
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,640
I sang it really well.

1666
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,580
This is crazy.

1667
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,480
(He got 100 points.)

1668
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,680
You did too well.

1669
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,270
How could I get 100?

1670
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:37,580
Why did you sing like that?

1671
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,080
I did it too well.

1672
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,690
I also think I sang so well.

1673
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:42,710
Jae Suk.

1674
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,480
Jin Sung will get shocked
when he watches this.

1675
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,350
You got 100 points.

1676
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:48,290
I thought this was "Mr. Trot."

1677
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,390
- You sang so well.
- I thought it was a recording.

1678
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,770
Why do I sing so well?

1679
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,060
How did you improve so much?

1680
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,660
This is crazy.

1681
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,560
I love the song.

1682
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,230
- It was great.
- Your condition is good.

1683
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,040
This won't do.

1684
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,370
I sing too well today.

1685
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:04,230
I never thought
I'd score 100 points.

1686
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:06,500
We shouldn't go for exciting songs.

1687
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,500
We should go with simple ones.

1688
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,870
You should sing a simple song.

1689
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,580
Let's sing "Emergency Room."

1690
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,770
- "Emergency Room."
- "Emergency Room?"

1691
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:13,580
Let's sing "Emergency Room."

1692
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,710
It's 80 points.
But this one scores well too.

1693
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:17,850
You can sing it.

1694
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,230
Don't get immersed in it.

1695
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,330
("Emergency Room" by Izi)

1696
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,790
This reminds you of the old days.

1697
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,730
- Get rid of your emotion.
- Get rid of it.

1698
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,600
(Sighing)

1699
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:33,270
I'm regretting

1700
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:37,270
(He's already soulful.)

1701
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:39,100
We won't be able to leave this room.

1702
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,770
What do we do? We sing so well.

1703
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,040
(He said he'll sing
in a simple way.)

1704
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:55,560
Because of my stubbornness

1705
01:00:55,730 --> 01:01:00,690
(No, I didn't mean it, you fool)

1706
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:02,390
You meant it!

1707
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,310
I don't know!

1708
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,620
(Overly emotional couple)

1709
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,350
Then why did you do that?

1710
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:21,120
(Please don't leave me)

1711
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,120
(Please leave me)

1712
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,580
(Dumping him)

1713
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,580
Leave.

1714
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,520
So Min. What's the score?

1715
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,290
- You are a singer!
- Look at that.

1716
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,230
- Hey.
- We can't do this.

1717
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,560
We have to get rid of all emotions.

1718
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,440
I should sing a song
that I can't sing.

1719
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,410
This is crazy. Is there no solution?

1720
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:45,140
Sing a song
that's really difficult to sing.

1721
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:46,870
Sing a pop song.

59:58,199 --> 01:00:00,500
We might get the score then.

1722
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,980
I think it'll work
if you sing a pop song.

1723
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,390
- Let's sing a song we don't know.
- A song we don't know.

1724
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,580
- Let's just press any number.
- Okay.

1725
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,060
- Press any number.
- Okay.

1726
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:58,890
Give me any two numbers.

1727
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:01,520
- Two, four.
- Two, four.

1728
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:02,960
- Three.
- Three.

1729
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,190
- Five.
- Five.

1730
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:07,230
- Seven.
- Seven.

1731
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,890
- I don't know this song.
- I don't know it too.

1732
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:12,960
We're supposed to sing a song
that we don't know.

1733
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,410
Why are you trying to find
a song you know?

1734
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:17,870
- Let's do it one more time.
- One more time.

1735
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:19,480
- Four, five.
- Four, five.

1736
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,850
- Seven.
- Seven.

1737
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,910
- So Min.
- One.

1738
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,310
- One.
- One.

1739
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:26,850
("I Like Love" by Hong Jin Young)

1740
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,290
- "I Like Love?"
- I don't know this song.

1741
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,480
We're not choosing a song we know.

1742
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,890
We're just pressing any number.

1743
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:34,060
We still need to know a little.

1744
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,480
Let's sing something fun.

1745
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,100
Something fun?

1746
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,290
- What do you mean? Fun?
- What about "Barefoot Youth?"

1747
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:41,290
- "Barefoot Youth." It's fun.
- Okay.

1748
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:43,690
Then I want the wires gone.
I want to dance.

1749
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,100
There are a lot of wires.

1750
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,460
Then how will you sing?

1751
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:49,870
I want to dance,
but there are a lot of wires.

1752
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:51,600
- We should sing "Barefoot Youth."
- It's so fun...

1753
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,870
to be in a karaoke.

1754
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,100
I'll raise one more key.

1755
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,350
- Let's start.
- Okay.

1756
01:02:55,350 --> 01:03:00,140
("Barefoot Youth" by BUCK)

1757
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,250
Great.

1758
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,310
Let's go.

1759
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:05,790
(They're still energetic.)

1760
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:09,620
One, two.

1761
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,600
(Let's go.)

1762
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:18,600
(Making a fuss)

1763
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,040
(Hoo! Ha!)

1764
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,350

1765
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:38,790
(Hoo! Ha!)

1766
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:40,850
Let's go.

01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,190
(They keep singing
even though they're tired.)

1770
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:57,580
Goodness.

1771
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,210
Hold on.

1772
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,680
This is crazy.

1773
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,480
- Let's do something short.
- Yes. Something short.

1774
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,770
Let's harmonize.

1775
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:04,870
Why is this...

1776
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,580
I think it's because we danced here.

1777
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:07,580
Should we not dance?

1778
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,690
Does it evaluate the dance too?

1779
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:12,410
Are we doing it wrong?

1780
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:13,890
- Does it sense that?
- Then...

1781
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,350
I think I get it.
We shouldn't get hyped up.

1782
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:18,330
- We shouldn't.
- Let's not get hyped up.

1783
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:19,690
- Also...
- We shouldn't get so excited.

1784
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,730
we should sing something difficult.

1785
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:24,060
- We should sing "Resignation."
- What?

1786
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,270
- By Big Mama?
- Yes.

1787
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,460
(Full of high notes)

1788
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:29,870
Good.

1789
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:32,680
(It's a difficult song to sing.)

1790
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:39,580
(They tortured the ears
of the listeners.)

1791
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:43,410
(Jae Suk and So Min
sings a duet song.)

1792
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,690
(Disharmony)

1793
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,430
(They put in high notes
to show off too.)

1794
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,500
(She got excited and sings "Tears.")

1795
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,060
Good. It's in the 80s.

1796
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,940
- What?
- This is driving me crazy.

1797
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:00,730
Why?

1798
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,370
Why were you showing off?

1799
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:05,330
Why can I sing high notes today?
This is crazy.

1800
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:06,370
Good.

1801
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:09,620
(They scored 100 again.)

1802
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:12,890
- This is crazy.
- Jae Suk.

1803
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:16,410
How could they give this 100 points?

1804
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,850
- But this...
- What do we do?

1805
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,690
Let's do this one.

1806
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,660
"The Train to South?"
"Does Anyone Love?"

1807
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:24,120
- "Sorrow."
- "Chalangchalang."

1808
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,690
- Chalangchalang.
- It's 2689.

1809
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,140
At this rate, we might have to ask
for 20 minutes of extra time.

1810
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,660
- We need more time.
- We've...

1811
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,460
been singing here
for more than 30 minutes.

1812
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,770
We need to ask for more minutes.

1813
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,330
- Let's sing "Chalangchalang."
- What's wrong with us?

1814
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,140
Why do you seem glad?

1815
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,750
It's so fun.

1816
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,680
(Shaking)

1817
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,850
Let's go.

1818
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:50,790
It's "Chalangchalang."

1819
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,750
(Lost in the music)

1820
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,480
(Twitching)

1821
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,890
Everybody chalangchalang.

1822
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:04,640
(Chalangchalang)

1823
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,270
You shouldn't sing too well.

1824
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:09,310
(Like whiskey in a glass)

1825
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:11,040
(Whiskey Ballantine's)

1826
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,140
(Psychorus is back.)

1827
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,940
(The cheesy girl is showing
some steps.)

1828
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:24,390
Let's go.

1829
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,000
(His gum chorus is energetic.)

1830
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,640
Are they on a date?

1831
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,460
(It's a mess.)

1832
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,100
(A couple on a date,
each doing what they want)

1833
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,600
Guys.

1834
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:52,310
Are you...

1835
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:55,350
(It was a great song.)

1836
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,390
(They finally got a score
in the 80s.)

1837
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,350
It's done.

1838
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:04,350
- We got it.
- We can leave!

1839
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,520
You guys...

1840
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,190
You two...

1841
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:10,540
I thought you two were in love.

1842
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,160
This is great.

1843
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,560
It's against us too.

1844
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,680
- It's against us.
- Mission completed.

1845
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,100
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1846
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:20,600
- Let's leave.
- Let's go.

1847
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,270
- It's too hot.
- It's too hot.

1848
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,870
- My throat hurts.
- Mine too.

1849
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,250
I sang too much.

1850
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,850
I think it became dark.

1851
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,210
- Hurry up.
- We have no time.

1852
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:33,790
- Let's take a taxi.
- It's this way.

1853
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,750
There's a taxi.

1854
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,290
- It's coming.
- Thank you.

1855
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:38,430
We're going.

1856
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

1857
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,620
We're going to Dosan Park.

1858
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:45,100
We'll just go for five minutes.

1859
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,960
- Okay.
- I'll start the time.

1860
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,680
The driver is driving well.

1861
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,730
Yes.

1862
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,180
The traffic is helping us.

1863
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,310
- The traffic lights are on time.
- Good.

1864
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,210
We are passing through
all the traffic lights. How nice.

1865
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,620
- Really?
- Okay.

1866
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:01,140
That team hasn't done one mission.

1867
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:02,980
I hope we win.

1868
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,160
- If we lose, I will feel dejected.
- But...

1869
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,430
(Team Jae Suk has a chance
since they have done both missions.)

1870
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,160
- We are nearly there.
- Yes. We are doing quite well.

1871
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,250
Look at the timer. The time is up.

1872
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,390
- It was perfect.
- It was perfect.

1873
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,890
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1874
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:12,930
The song ended too.

1875
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:13,960
(They arrive at the destination
on the 5-minute mark.)

1876
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,100
Sir, thank you.

1877
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,160
- Thank you. Please stay healthy.
- Thank you.

1878
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,660
Where are we? Hold on.

1879
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:20,770
- We have 100m left to go.
- We turn left here.

1880
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:21,940
We turn left down the road.

1881
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,040
- Where is the location?
- Where is the location? Here?

1882
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,440
We are here.

1883
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,710
- They aren't here yet.
- They aren't here yet.

1884
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:28,870
(They begin to run.)

1885
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:30,540
Where is it?
Isn't the other team here yet?

1886
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:32,310
(If they arrive first,
Team Jae Suk will win!)

1887
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:33,540
- Wait for me.
- So Min.

1888
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,140
Are they here?

1889
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,750
- Hurry up.
- Gosh.

1890
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,060
- We won.
- Hurry up.

1891
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:41,290
(Team Suk Jin arrived
at the ending location first!)

1892
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:42,520
What's wrong with you guys?

1893
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,620
- This is the worst.
- Why didn't you pick up the phone?

1894
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,890
(They thought Team Suk Jin had
a remaining mission.)

1895
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,160
What could it be?

1896
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,540
(Team Suk Jin chose
the second mission.)

1897
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:52,230
(They picked
the second mission ball.)

1898
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:53,330
What is it?

1899
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,910
"Take a photo with an acquaintance
you called recently."

1900
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,910
One of you will pull up
the call history.

1901
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,370
- Your lucky number is three.
- Yes.

1902
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,640
Meet up with the third person
and take a photo with him or her.

1903
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,210
- For me, it's Se Chan.
- What?

1904
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,620
Please show us.

1905
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,620
- Is it really Se Chan?
- You are the fourth person.

1906
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,580
(Se Chan is Haha's 3rd person
in the call history.)

1907
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,750
It's Se Chan.

1908
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,520
- Doesn't it give us an advantage?
- It does.

1909
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,960
We just need to take the photo
before the end, right?

1910
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,120
- That's right.
- That's right.

1911
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,960
- Take a photo with Se Chan.
- I can sneak up...

1912
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,370
and take a photo with him.

1913
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,430
We need to take it...

1914
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:24,100
- right before they enter the place.
- That's right.

1915
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,330
(They set out to take the photo
right before the end.)

1916
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:27,440
They haven't arrived yet.

1917
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,060
- They haven't arrived yet.
- They haven't arrived yet.

1918
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,370
- They haven't arrived yet.
- We need to catch them.

1919
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:31,910
- Where are they?
- We need to complete the mission.

1920
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,540
- We need to catch them.
- Did they arrive?

1921
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,440
Jong Kook,
let's come up with a plan.

1922
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,440
(Hurried)

1923
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,410
- Haha, turn on the camera.
- What?

1924
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,520
Here. Would you take the photo?

1925
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,910
- I will do it.
- When I put my arm around him,

1926
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,160
- take a photo from afar.
- I will do it.

1927
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,560
- It doesn't need to be a selfie.
- It just needs to show the faces.

1928
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,190
- It just needs to show the faces.
- Let's do it when he enters.

1929
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:48,330
Let's do it when he passes
the entrance.

1930
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,160
This is nerve-racking.

1931
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,190
- Very nerve-racking.
- I know.

1932
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:53,270
- It's understandable.
- It isn't nerve-racking, Haha.

1933
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,370
It needs to be a shot
of two people, right?

1934
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,440
It just needs to show the faces.

1935
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,060
It's a success
if we take the photo, right?

1936
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,330
I just hope
they don't enter as a group...

1937
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:04,700
and block Se Chan's face.

1938
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:07,610
Team Jae Suk will win
if they enter...

1939
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:09,870
before you complete the mission.

1940
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:11,410
(Team Jae Suk will win
if all members enter first!)

1941
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,540
- Haha and Se Chan's faces.
- Isn't the other team here yet?

1942
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,650
- So Min.
- You guys took so long.

1943
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:16,750
Are they here?

1944
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,280
- Hurry up.
- Gosh.

1945
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,780
- We won.
- Hurry up.

1946
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,120
What's wrong with you guys?

1947
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,560
- This is the worst.
- Why didn't you pick up the phone?

1948
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,990
- You guys took so long.
- Haha.

1949
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:24,990
- What's wrong with you guys?
- We went to Gimpo.

1950
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:25,990
What?

1951
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,990
(Haha is waiting at the entrance.)

1952
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,490
- What's wrong with you guys?
- We went to Gimpo.

1953
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,460
- What?
- We went all the way to Gimpo.

1954
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,370
(Team Suk Jin must take the photo
before So Min enters.)

1955
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:38,280
- You guys took so long.
- Haha.

1956
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,780
- What's wrong with you guys?
- We went to Gimpo.

1957
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,480
- What?
- We went all the way to Gimpo.

1958
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:43,320
(Jong Kook has the camera ready.)

1959
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,480
- Then...
- You called me many times.

1960
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,240
(The result of the mission
will decide the winning team!)

1961
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,650
- What's wrong with you guys?
- We went to Gimpo.

1962
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,080
- What?
- We went all the way to Gimpo.

1963
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,580
- Then...
- You called me many times.

1964
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:56,430
(The second mission: Complete)

1965
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:57,820
Then we went back to Yeouido.

1966
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:59,430
My goodness.

1967
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:01,900
- I took it. Here.
- Yes!

1968
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,830
(So Min hasn't entered
the place yet.)

1969
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:06,360
- It's a success.
- What?

1970
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:07,740
When did you get here?

1971
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:08,960
(They completed the mission
before Team Jae Suk entered.)

1972
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,780
- You completed the mission.
- It's unmistakable.

1973
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:13,370
Team Suk Jin succeeded in
completing the mission.

1974
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:14,810
Since they arrived
at the ending location first,

1975
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:16,210
- they won.
- It's unmistakable.

1976
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:17,950
We completed the mission just now.

1977
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:19,350
- Really?
- The second mission.

1978
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,890
Had you entered faster,
you would have won.

1979
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,040
What was the mission?

1980
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:24,150
Taking a photo with Se Chan.

1981
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:25,650
Really?

1982
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,750
Had you entered faster,
you would have won.

1983
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,750
Had So Min entered
with the other members,

1984
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,200
- then you would have won.
- You would have won.

1985
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,960
We hadn't completed the mission.

1986
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,120
We lost
because you entered belatedly.

1987
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,440
We shouldn't have sung
that last song.

1988
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,490
We sang so many songs
at the karaoke.

1989
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:39,810
- Your mission involved singing.
- We partied so hard.

1990
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:42,770
- A score in the 80s.
- We spent nearly 50 minutes there.

1991
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,070
- Did you go to Gimpo?
- We went all the way to Gimpo.

1992
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,400
- We went all the way to Gimpo.
- Gimpo?

1993
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,150
- We almost went to Pangyo.
- We almost went to Pangyo.

1994
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:51,480
- We got off one stop before Pangyo.
- That's right. Seriously.

1995
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,390
Thank you for working hard...

1996
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,690
- and coming all the way here.
- We really worked hard today.

1997
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:58,020
- Seriously.
- The four-member team won.

1998
01:11:58,410 --> 01:11:59,950
- It was close.
- How disappointing.

1999
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,230
- It's understandable.
- You entered without thinking,

2000
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:02,950
- but we were really nervous.
- Yes. It was nerve-racking.

2001
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,860
"What if we fail to take the photo?"

2002
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,150
We wouldn't have gotten...

2003
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:07,430
- another chance.
- Seriously.

2004
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:10,960
To see if the lucky numbers
that led you here...

2005
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:16,070
are truly lucky,
we will have the Lottery Game.

2006
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,780
- This is important.
- This is important indeed.

2007
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,610
The lottery box contains...

2008
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:23,040
the lucky numbers
each team has used so far.

2009
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:24,570
If you used five multiple times,

2010
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:26,990
there will be
multiple number five balls.

2011
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:28,990
So keep that in mind...

2012
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:30,780
and put five numbers...

2013
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,410
- on the lottery ticket.
- Five.

2014
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:34,080
- The numbers we used today.
- Yes.

2015
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:35,650
Regardless of the order,

2016
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,620
you place 1st
if you get 5 numbers right.

2017
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:39,600
You place 2nd
if you get 4 numbers right.

2018
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,030
You place 3rd
if you get 3 numbers right.

2019
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:42,030
There will be
appropriate prizes too.

2020
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:43,530
- Okay.
- Understood.

2021
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:46,500
- The numbers can overlap.
- Okay.

2022
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,400
Since the 4-member team arrived 1st,

2023
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,110
they will get
two lottery tickets each.

2024
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:52,610
Since the 3-member team arrived 2nd,
they will get 1 lottery ticket each.

2025
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:53,610
Okay.

2026
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:56,350
- This is the real deal.
- We can still win a prize.

2027
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:57,540
- This is the deciding game.
- Team Tortoise.

2028
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,910
- Yes.
- Team Tortoise.

2029
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:01,390
It's important
to choose the right numbers.

2030
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,520
We are bound to get eight.

2031
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:03,950
We should put down multiple eights.

2032
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,910
What were
Team Suk Jin's lucky numbers?

2033
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:07,780
They were one...

2034
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,620
- Five and eight.
- Five.

2035
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:14,320
- Seven was picked three times.
- Really?

2036
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,440
Did we pick one?

2037
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:17,960
- We didn't, right?
- We did. Once.

2038
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,160
We did pick one.

2039
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,360
We picked five once too.

2040
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:23,370
All right. Let's go.

2041
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,480
(They finished filling out
the lottery tickets.)

2042
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,980
- No one will get all five numbers.
- I am sure of it.

2043
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:28,610
- It's too thick.
- Who will draw the balls?

2044
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:30,370
For the lottery drawing,

2045
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,870
- we invited a specialist.
- Who is it?

2046
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:35,580
Kang Chan Hee, please come on out.

2047
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:38,520
He is the richest cameraman.

2048
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:40,450
The master among cameramen.

2049
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:43,230
- Yes.
- Please draw five balls.

2050
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,060
- The ancestor among cameramen.
- Let's see the odds.

2051
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:47,930
- Look.
- Two?

2052
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:49,570
- What's the number?
- I want to place first.

2053
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,140
- Eight.
- Eight.

2054
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,200
- Yes.
- Okay.

2055
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,570
- Eight.
- Eight.

2056
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:54,570
- Yes.
- Okay.

2057
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:55,570
- Eight.
- That's one.

2058
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:57,940
- Okay. This is great.
- Okay.

2059
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,000
- Eight.
- Eight.

2060
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,150
(Ji Hyo went all in
on number eight.)

2061
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:02,240
- Eight.
- That's one.

2062
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,180
- Okay.
- We got eight.

2063
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,610
- I hope we get eight again.
- Seriously.

2064
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:07,780
Let's see another eight.

2065
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:10,080
- Okay.
- We got eight.

2066
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:11,490
- I hope we get eight again.
- Seriously.

2067
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:12,580
Let's see another eight.

2068
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,390
- Seven.
- I don't have it.

2069
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:16,860
- Was there a seven?
- For goodness' sake.

2070
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,400
- Seven.
- Seven.

2071
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,230
- Was there a seven?
- For goodness' sake.

2072
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,270
- I crossed out seven.
- No way.

2073
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,360
No way.

2074
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,790
(Only Suk Jin and Haha had 7.)

2075
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:25,940
- I crossed out seven.
- I crossed it out.

2076
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,000
- Seven.
- I don't have it.

2077
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,070
- Was there a seven?
- For goodness' sake.

2078
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:30,140
It was their lucky number.

2079
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,700
It's too bad.

2080
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,570
(Amidst the disappointment,
Chan Hee picks the next ball.)

2081
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:36,000
- What?
- Nine.

2082
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,020
- I don't have it.
- Nine.

2083
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,020
- What?
- Nine.

2084
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,020
- I don't have it.
- Nine.

2085
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,150
We don't have nine.

2086
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:41,490
I changed 9 to 8.

2087
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:42,540
I have all the numbers.

2088
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,820
I changed 9 to 8.

2089
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,320
- I just need three.
- Gosh, Chan Hee.

2090
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,690
Please give me another eight.

2091
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,320
- I need 8 or 3.
- I need 5 or 3.

2092
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,560
- I need 8 or 3. Please 8, 3, or 5.
- I need 5 or 3.

2093
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,360
(The next ball)

2094
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,660
- Eight.
- Eight.

2095
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,960
I need 8, 3, or 5.

2096
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:57,030
- Eight.
- Eight.

2097
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,770
- This is great. Okay.
- Okay.

2098
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:00,000
Now comes the last number.

2099
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,360
- Eight.
- Eight.

2100
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,610
- For goodness' sake.
- Now comes the last number.

2101
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:06,870
- I should have kept 9.
- Why aren't we getting 3?

2102
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,570
- Three.
- Three or five.

2103
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,910
- We need 3 or 5.
- We need 3 or 5.

2104
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:12,540
- Seriously.
- Give us 5 or 3.

2105
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,580
- Give us 5 or 3.
- I need 8, 5, or 1.

2106
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,650
(What will be the last number?)

2107
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,780
- Give us 5 or 3.
- I need 8, 5, or 1.

2108
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,450
- Three.
- It has to be three.

2109
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:24,820
- Eight.
- Eight.

2110
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,900
- Eight?
- I knew it.

2111
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,320
- I need 8, 5, or 1.
- Three.

2112
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,570
- Eight. I got 3 numbers.
- Why didn't I add another 8?

2113
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:30,660
Three eights.

2114
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,500
- I never get lucky.
- I got three numbers right.

2115
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,400
I never get lucky.

2116
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,610
- Three.
- It has to be three.

2117
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:37,740
- Eight.
- Eight.

2118
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,140
- Eight?
- I knew it.

2119
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,900
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, Suk Jin, Haha)

2120
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,150
Are we done?

2121
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,740
One of these should have been nine.

2122
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,410
- Chan Hee, thank you.
- Thank you.

2123
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:48,210
- I got three numbers right.
- Same here.

2124
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,690
Had I kept 9,
I would have gotten 4 numbers.

2125
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:51,080
Who got three numbers right?

2126
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,890
- Here.
- I am glad you did it, So Min.

2127
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:55,250
- Did anyone get 4 numbers right?
- I got 3 numbers right.

2128
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,450
- Three.
- Three?

2129
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:58,230
- Did anyone get four numbers right?
- No.

2130
01:15:58,230 --> 01:15:59,560
Can Se Chan and I combine
the numbers?

2131
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,290
- I changed it at the last minute.
- Can we do that?

2132
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,270
You wrote down the same numbers.

2133
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:05,330
(They wrote down similar numbers.)

2134
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:08,960
We will give you
the prize for third place.

2135
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:12,530
You remember
what your lucky number was, right?

2136
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:13,680
- Yes. Mine was 3.
- Mine was 9.

2137
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,900
The prize suits the lucky number.
Please bring it in.

2138
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,350
- What's the prize for first place?
- What is it?

2139
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,570
Does it suit the lucky number?

2140
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:20,240
- I guess it's different...
- What's this?

2141
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,410
for each number.

2142
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,780
Although the package is big,

2143
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:25,320
- the actual prize might be shabby.
- I know.

2144
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,120
- Shabby.
- You know,

2145
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,730
you shouldn't have voiced
that thought.

2146
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:30,530
- I could hear you from here.
- Suk Jin.

2147
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:31,860
Mine was seven.

2148
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,120
- Mine was 5.
- Mine was 7.

2149
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,290
This is for nine.

2150
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,700
- This is...
- Mine was seven.

2151
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2152
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,790
- What could it be?
- Thank you.

2153
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:43,030
- It was the lucky number race,
- Yes.

2154
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:46,980
so we prepared a gift set
that is full of your lucky number.

2155
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,680
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2156
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,180
- They look strange.
- Are these So Min's?

2157
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:51,520
- My goodness.
- Was that her lucky number?

2158
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,450
(Miscellaneous items
with the lucky number)

2159
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,520
- How pretty.
- So Min, they are nice.

2160
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:57,360
- My goodness.
- Was that her lucky number?

2161
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:59,080
My goodness.

2162
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,730
- How pretty.
- So Min, they are nice.

2163
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:01,930
(How pretty.)

2164
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:03,120
- How nice.
- What are those?

2165
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,030
I don't want them. What are those?

2166
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:06,570
So Min, this is...

2167
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,290
- How pretty.
- In my life...

2168
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,530
So Min, they are very pretty.

2169
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,660
In my life,

2170
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,100
- I have never worn this color.
- Seriously.

2171
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,270
- Jae Suk, we are the winners.
- Look at this.

2172
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,200
- We are the winners.
- When I have a daughter,

2173
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,330
- I will give this to her.
- We are the winners.

2174
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:22,740
Had you gotten four numbers right,
you would have received a pork set.

2175
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:23,820
- What?
- Had you gotten five numbers right,

2176
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,020
- you would have received beef.
- Really?

2177
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:27,210
- Really?
- It's too bad.

2178
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:28,710
Everyone looks unhappy.

2179
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,820
- Everyone looks unhappy.
- It's too bad.

2180
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,710
- Why did I take out nine?
- How nice.

2181
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:33,730
(Dissatisfied)

2182
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:34,950
Does anyone not like
his or her lucky number?

2183
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:35,950
- Anyone?
- I am sorry,

2184
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:37,250
but this isn't even my size.

2185
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,430
- It won't fit me.
- It's too small.

2186
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:41,770
Give it to Na Eun.
Na Eun should wear it.

2187
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:43,230
- Na Eun?
- Yes.

2188
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:44,740
Na Eun should wear better clothes.

2189
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:46,140
He has a point.

2190
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,270
- It's a nice top.
- Look at Jae Suk's reaction.

2191
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:51,400
- It looks nice.
- Thus, today's race ended.

2192
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,530
Thank you for your hard work.

2193
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:53,900
- Good work.
- Thank you.

2194
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,900
Thank you for your hard work.

2195
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,350
Give us the real prize now.

2196
01:17:58,410 --> 01:17:59,740
Hello.

2197
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,890
(A week later, N Studio in Hanam)

2198
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,150
Mr. Hairtail is here.

2199
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,560
We aren't dressed
for a party, but a gig.

2200
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,750
When else would I wear
such an outfit?

2201
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:11,950
Good morning.

2202
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:14,570
(The stars in fancy outfits enter.)

2203
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,940
- Their outfits are no joke.
- It's a nice day.

2204
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,160
- How nice.
- The perfect day for fish cake.

2205
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,110
- Have a glass of wine each.
- Hey, we got fish cake.

2206
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,740
Is it coke? Grape juice?

2207
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,330
It doesn't go well with sandwiches.

2208
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,740
Look at that tropical fish.

2209
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,180
The tropical fish will eat.

2210
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,740
- Tropical fish.
- Eat with the hairtail.

2211
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:35,190
- Fish.
- Let's eat.

2212
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:37,020
- They are fish.
- Fish.

2213
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:39,150
- They are fish. He is a hairtail.
- I am a hairtail.

2214
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,930
- He is a tropical fish.
- Is he a tropical fish?

2215
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:42,030
He is a tropical fish.

2216
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:43,400
(Eating fish feed)

2217
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,820
- He is a tropical fish indeed.
- It's tasty.

2218
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,320
Nemo's friend.

2219
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,460
- We are having a party.
- Yes.

2220
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,270
- That's right.
- Are you going to work?

2221
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,030
- What's up with the two of you?
- I am at work.

2222
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:53,460
- He is going to sing at a wedding.
- Don't be ridiculous. What's this?

2223
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:54,740
Running Man is work.

2224
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:57,310
- I guess our outfits are weak.
- I know.

2225
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:59,180
- Suk Jin said...
- I see why Suk Jin is annoyed.

2226
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:01,870
- We will accept your criticism.
- Yes. We will accept it.

2227
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,540
I didn't expect that reaction.

2228
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:04,870
(Suk Jin picked a fight
and ended up looking bad.)

2229
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:07,850
Are you the skinny Zhu Bajie?

2230
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:12,780
- He looks like it.
- Seriously.

2231
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,030
- That's right.
- The skinny Zhu Bajie.

2232
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:16,390
- "Sun Wukong, what's wrong?"
- You are spot on.

2233
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:18,530
- "Sun Wukong, what's going on?"
- You are spot on.

2234
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:19,750
"Sun Wukong, what's wrong?"

2235
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,160
- Zhu Bajie went on a diet.
- "Don't be like that."

2236
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,360
He really looks like Zhu Bajie.

2237
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,960
- "Sun Wukong, what's going on?"
- Zhu Bajie who lost weight.

2238
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,270
He has Zhu Bajie's face.

2239
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:27,640
He really does.

2240
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,740
He has Zhu Bajie's face.

2241
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,140
I see the resemblance.

2242
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,500
- A piranha.
- Today, Ji Hyo dressed up.

2243
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,700
Ji Hyo, you and I
look good together.

2244
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,070
- You and I?
- Yes. Our outfits go well together.

2245
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:38,480
Suk Jin, take off your coat.

2246
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,680
- What?
- Take off your coat.

2247
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,240
- Come on. Take it off.
- It's cold.

2248
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,410
- Take it off.
- It's too cold.

2249
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,750
- No.
- You stayed true to your character.

2250
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,190
- I mean...
- You lead a fake life.

2251
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,560
- Everything is fake.
- Fake.

2252
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,650
You lead a fake life.

2253
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:51,400
- Everything is fake.
- This is your outfit.

2254
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,600
Everything is fake.

2255
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,290
- He can't sit down in this outfit.
- What's that?

2256
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,900
What's this? A barricade?

2257
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:58,940
No.

2258
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,500
- Did you barricade your body?
- It accentuates the look.

2259
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,530
It's cold.

2260
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,830
The hairtail is cold.

2261
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,980
The hairtail is cold.

2262
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,280
- The hairtail.
- Yes, I am a hairtail.

2263
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,740
- The coat completes the look.
- Suk Jin...

2264
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,870
was so cold that he said,
"Yes, I am a hairtail."

2265
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:13,070
Gosh, Suk Jin!

2266
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,740
Gosh, Suk Jin!

2267
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:18,150
- Fur went into her eyes.
- Fur went into my eyes.

2268
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,750
It was fur from your coat.

2269
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:20,990
Did you take it out?

2270
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:23,450
It must have been hard
to find a suit like that.

2271
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:24,700
I am wearing an ordinary outfit.

2272
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,730
So Min, are you filming
a period drama?

2273
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,460
- My outfit is a bit...
- Look at So Min's shoes.

2274
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:30,770
So Min,
aren't your shoes too pointy?

2275
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:31,960
- What?
- They are an eyesore.

2276
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,360
You could kill a person
with those shoes.

2277
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,640
- Aren't they pretty?
- Let me borrow those shoes later.

2278
01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:37,530
- Why?
- I need them to eat tteokbokki.

2279
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,400
- She looks like...
- Skewered rice cake.

2280
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,900
- a woman in "The General's Son."
- Yes.

2281
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,910
- Namiko?
- You look like Namiko.

2282
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:46,370
- You look like Namiko.
- Seriously.

2283
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,710
- You look like Namiko.
- I can see the resemblance.

2284
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:52,080
Zhu Bajie.

2285
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,110
(Haha captivates attention.)

2286
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:54,750
- Zhu Bajie.
- That's so funny.

2287
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:57,600
- Zhu Bajie.
- He really looks like Zhu Bajie.

2288
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:59,650
- Zhu Bajie who lost weight.
- Zhu Bajie who lost weight.

2289
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:00,700
- Anyone would agree...
- He really looks that way.

2290
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,030
that he looks like...

2291
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:03,360
- the skinny Zhu Bajie.
- Seriously.

2292
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,070
Zhu Bajie who went on a diet.

2293
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:10,200
For the stars who attended
the year-end party,

2294
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,700
- we invited two more stars.
- Okay.

2295
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:17,240
Let's welcome the first star.
Please come on out.

2296
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,240
Who is it?

2297
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,780
- You know, the temperature...
- The temperature is below zero.

2298
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,760
- Okay.
- "Counting Stars."

2299
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,340
"Counting Stars."

2300
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,970
(Singer, BE'O)

2301
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:51,210
(The hip-hop Zhu Bajie
begins to groove.)

2302
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,250
BE'O.

2303
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:55,450
(Counting stars,
Pearls in the night sky)

2304
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:57,210
I love it.

2305
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:00,850
Zhu Bajie.

2306
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:02,050
Zhu Bajie, get out.

2307
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,880
(He averts his eyes.)

2308
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:09,000
(Pay attention to me.)

2309
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,830
(Even the hairtail joins in
and acts like a hip-hop musician.)

2310
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:13,500
Hey, get lost.

2311
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:16,910
(He suddenly asks
for a diss battle.)

2312
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,560
Why are you picking a fight?

2313
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:23,450
(He is showing his professional side
since it's quite hard to perform.)

2314
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:26,750
(Shoving his face)

2315
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,280
- What are you doing?
- Get out.

2316
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,510
(He shows off his fake fur coat.)

2317
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,590
BE'O.

2318
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:39,090
(Counting stars,
Pearls in the night sky)

2319
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:44,830
Don't you hate the way...

2320
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:46,500
- he acts like a hip-hop musician?
- I hate it.

2321
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,500
(Absorbed)

2322
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,000
Isn't this Louis Vuitton fake?

2323
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,840
- It's fake.
- It's a fake Louis Vuitton.

2324
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,080

2327
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,300
- It's fake.
- Say hello to Zhu Bajie.

2328
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,620
Haha's outfit is fake.

2329
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:02,640
- Fake?
- BE'O.

2330
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,310
He is Zhu Bajie who lost weight.
He is Zhu Bajie who went on a diet.

2331
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:06,850
- BE'O.
- Fake.

2332
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,490
- He is a hairtail.
- Yes, I am a hairtail.

2333
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,220
He is a tropical fish.

01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,350
- He is a tropical fish.

2335
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:13,750
- He is a tropical fish.
- Party time.

2336

She is Namiko.

2337
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:16,050
- Hello.

2338
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:17,800
- He is a trainer at a gym.

2339
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:19,300
He is a trainer.

2340
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,340

2343
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,000
(He exchanged greetings
with the celebrities at the party.)

2344
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,800
- BE'O.
- Hello.

2345
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,550
(The real hip-hop star, BE'O)

2346
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:32,210
BE'O finally visited the show.

2347
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:34,010
I love BE'O.

2348
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:35,010
Would you please sing "Complex?"

2349
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,140
- Okay.
- The power of elementary schoolers.

2350
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:38,990
- Please sing "Complex."
- I like "Suddenly" too.

2351
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:41,850
- Shall I sing it right away?
- Please sing "Complex" a bit later.

2352
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,460
A bit later?
We need to listen to "Complex..."

2353
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:45,160
- right away.
- The second star is waiting.

2354
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,590
- The second star.
- It's cold.

2355
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:47,890
- Okay.
- Let's wait.

2356
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,590
I am so happy since BE'O is here.

2357
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:51,870
The elementary schoolers
will go wild.

2358
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:57,000
You seem awfully happy to be here.
Isn't that right?

2359
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,040
- Don't be like that, Suk Jin.
- I am really happy.

2360
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,170
- Right?
- I am really happy.

2361
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:01,300
- You wanted to be here, right?
- Yes. Totally.

2362
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,580
I wanted to see you too.

2363
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:03,640
All right.

2364
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,950
- It's nice to see you happy.
- Just a moment ago,

2365
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:06,780
he was like, "Who is the guest?"

2366
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:09,470
(Fake)

2367
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:12,450
- For goodness' sake.
- You didn't know who was coming.

2368
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:13,710
(The boisterous greetings end.)

2369
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:17,590
It's time to welcome
the second star.

2370
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:18,880
- Please come on out.
- Who is it?

2371
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,030
He is a close friend of mine.

2372
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,630
- There we go.
- What?

2373
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:23,720
My goodness.

2374
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,720
(A star appears.)

2375
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,220
Jukjae is here.

2376
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:27,540
- There we go.
- What?

2377
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:30,260
(Singer, Jukjae)

2378
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:31,760
Jukjae.

2379
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:35,800
("Let's Go See the Stars" by Jukjae)

2380
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,300
it's the song So Min loves.

2381
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,080
It's a festival.

2382
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,010
Grand Mint Festival!

2383
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,750
I went to Grand Mint Festival.

2384
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:46,790
- He must have been cold.
- I know.

2385
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,750
(The melodious guitar sound...)

2386
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,050
He is handsome.

2387
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:53,090
(suits the year-end party.)

2388
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:55,750
- He can sing live in the morning.
- He is cool.

2389
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:05,000
(Where are you? What are you up to?)

2390
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,040
- Here!
- Me?

2391
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,910
- Here!
- Let's go!

2392
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:12,250
(Let's go see the stars)

2393
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:14,140
- Suk Jin.
- I will go with you.

2394
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:15,380
Me too.

2395
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:18,510
(Come out of the house
for a short while)

2396
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:19,640
Really?

2397
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:21,680
I am not wearing any makeup.
Is that okay?

2398
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:29,660
(These middle-aged men enjoy
the sweet song in a homely way.)

2399
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,170
We are such middle-aged men.
This is an old dance.

2400
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:33,200
This is an old dance.

2401
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:38,240
(The second star
also has trouble performing.)

2402
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:40,910
(We won't go anywhere far)

2403
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:42,800
We are such middle-aged men.

2404
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:43,840
- It's okay.
- I love it.

2405
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,050
Let's go somewhere far.

2406
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:49,580
(But I will hold your hand tight)

2407
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:52,680
- Hold it tight. Don't let it go.
- Let's kiss as well.

2408
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:03,130
- His voice doesn't waver at all.
- I know.

2409
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,500
(He wraps up the performance
perfectly.)

2410
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,670
- You are cool.
- Jukjae.

2411
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:10,760
- Jukjae.
- Let's go see the stars.

2412
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,100
- Jukjae.
- That was incredible.

2413
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,930
You are so cool.

2414
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,670
(I am incapable)

2415
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:17,750
(I am lacking)

2416
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,050
- Jukjae is a unique character.
- He is slow.

2417
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:21,280
(Is Jukjae really lacking?)

2418
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,280
We don't have time.

2419
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,710
(It has been a while
since people told me that I can't)

2420
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:26,990
(But there are things
BE'O just can't do.)

2421
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,160
(No!)

2422
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,160
(Not everyone can enjoy
the year-end party!)

2423
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,420
(A famous singer picks up a guitar
because he is hungry.)

2424
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,500
(Thank you for the song request.)

2425
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,850
Can you play a song?

2426
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:36,920
(Thank you
for the 2nd song request.)

2427
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:37,920
(Thank you for the food.)

2428
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,300
(Can you sing two songs for a coin?)

2429
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,630
He can do it.

2430
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:44,560
(A music discussion
with the singers)

2431
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:46,210
(When the members become absorbed
and fight without any logic,)

2432
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:47,210
(a guest becomes flustered.)

2433
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:48,630
It could be a new encounter.

2434
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,580
(Is Jukjae a player?)

2435
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,800
It contains my sincerity!

2436
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,080
(It's a party with all the spectacles.
How will it end?)

2437
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,140
(The Year-End Party With Stars)

2438
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:58,140
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
