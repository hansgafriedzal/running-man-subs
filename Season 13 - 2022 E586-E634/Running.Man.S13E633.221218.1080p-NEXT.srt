1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,770
(The year-end party of the stars
began last week.)

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,280
(The first guest, BE'O)

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,350
(Zhu Bajie and the tropical fish
welcomed him.)

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,350
(The second guest, Jukjae)

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,260
(The Zoned-out Crazy Sisters
were so into his song.)

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,450
- His voice doesn't waver at all.
- I know.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,060
(The two stars who have "stars"
in common showed up like that.)

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,330
- Jukjae.
- Jukjae.

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,920
- Jukjae.
- Let's go see the stars.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,170
- Jukjae.
- That was incredible.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,870
He looks fine when he's dressed up.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,870
He really does.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,460
Are you saying Jukjae is not fine
at other times?

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,560
I've never seen him
dressed up like that before.

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,170
Isn't this your first time
meeting Jukjae?

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,530
Jukjae...

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,880
- This is your first time.
- I think this is my first time.

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,200
- Hello.
- You're so cool.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,500
- Jukjae.
- You're the best.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,550
- Hey, Jukjae.
- Jukjae.

21
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,450
- Jukjae. Hey, you...
- He's handsome.

22
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,450
We have Jukjae and BE'O here today.

23
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,660
(BE'O, Jukjae)

24
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,680
Hello. I'm a singer-songwriter,
Jukjae.

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,660
- Singer-songwriter.
- Singer-songwriter.

26
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,920
BE'O, introduce yourself.

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
Hello. I'm BE'O who does music.
Nice to meet you.

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,870
- The king of the young generation.
- Young generation?

29
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,260
- What are you saying?
- So I'm wondering...

30
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,980
how they are feeling to be
on Running Man for the first time.

31
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,180
I've been watching this show
since elementary school.

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,070
- Right. You're a Running Man kid.
- He's one of the Running Man kids.

33
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,840
I used to rip off name tags with
my friends at an amusement park.

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,240
- Right.
- That's amazing.

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,560
The thing is, BE'O's father is...

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,850
two years younger than Suk Jin.

37
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,010
My goodness.

38
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,180
He's like a father.

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,680
- Hey, is that true?
- Father!

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,760
- How old are you?
- You're his uncle.

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,260
- I'm 23.
- He's 23.

42
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,320
Right. He's two years
older than my son.

43
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,400
Exactly.

44
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,870
It's possible if his dad
got married young.

45
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,790
I have a nephew and a son here.

46
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,870
Like I said before,
it hasn't been long...

47
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,040
since BE'O's debut,

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,070
But he's so popular.

49
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,100
but he already has
a lot of hit songs.

50
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,370
I love his songs.

51
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,010
- He has a lot of great songs.
- I really like them.

52
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,180
- Counting stars
- Stars

53
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,840
- Pearls in the night sky
- Pearls

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,650
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

55
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,760
- Sorry.
- Sorry for what?

56
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,460
- Right.
- Why are you sorry?

57
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,030
(He keeps singing
ignoring everyone.)

58
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,030
(Shutting his eyes tight)

59
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,230
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,860
My son is an elementary school kid.
He's the king of the school kids.

61
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,150
- Is he?
- Of course.

62
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,190
When I met him before,
I took pictures with him.

63
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,220
- Really?
- My son loves him.

64
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,270
You know, Haha is...

65
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,870
a goner in the hip hop scene.

66
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,060
No, I've still got it.

67
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,370
- He's a goner.
- He even plays along with the joke.

68
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,470
Why are you doing this to me?

69
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,240
This is how we exchange jokes.

70
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,120
I'm a fan of yours.

71
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,840
And we have Jukjae here.
As you already know,

72
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,910
he captivates women's hearts
with his sweet voice.

73
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,280
That's true.

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,210
He makes a lot of suggestions.

75
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,220
- "Let's go see the stars."
- "Shall we go walk together?"

76
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,220
Do you usually make
many suggestions to women?

77
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,860
- No.
- "Will you go out with me?"

78
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,960
- Actually...
- To do something.

79
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,930
I actually like rock music.

80
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,400
He plays the guitar really well.

81
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,140
- Right.
- He was a famous guitarist.

82
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,400
He did
a lot of famous songs we know...

83
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,500
He was well known
as the guitarist of IU's band.

84
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
- He worked with IU?
- Sure.

85
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,780
- Really?
- He's famous.

86
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,870
What are the songs you played?
Where you played the guitar.

87
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,150
Well...

88
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,210
(Hesitant)

89
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,410
I can't think of anything.

90
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,490
You have to think.

91
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,060
You just said
there were a lot of songs.

92
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,330
- But he can't say anything.
- Why can't you think of anything?

93
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,360
- That's because he did many songs.
- Jukjae, if you can't name one,

94
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,150
who else would say that?

95
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,830
He just works with many musicians.

96
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,960
Still...

97
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,060
Just name any musician.
We wouldn't know anyway.

98
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,590
Right. Jukjae, I told you
not to feel nervous.

99
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,370
Just say the names of the artists.

100
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,840
- The artists?
- Yes.

101
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,400
Why can't I think of anyone?

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,370
- What was that?
- I get it.

103
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,840
- He didn't sleep well last night.
- There are more.

104
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,370
- You didn't sleep well, did you?
- No.

105
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,840
- I knew it.
- It's like, "This is Jukjae."

106
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,240
Suk Jin really wants Jukjae...

107
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,310
- to write him a song.
- Did you think about it?

108
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,180
- Yes.
- Are you interested?

109
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,430
No. Stay quiet.

110
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,860
Jukjae promised
to give me his song first.

111
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,150
- Really?
- Yes.

112
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,220
He has many people
to write a song for.

113
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,300
That's true.

114
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,490
That sounds great.

115
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,400
I met him before.

116
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,870
I think we met before.
Do you remember when we met?

117
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,310
I think this is my first time.

118
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,470
- What was that?
- Am I wrong?

119
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,840
He says it's his first time.

120
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,370
Isn't this your first time
meeting Jukjae?

121
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,440
(Only 5 minutes ago,
he said it was his first time.)

122
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,550
- We met. He doesn't remember that.
- Where?

123
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,050
- When I did my radio show.
- He says...

124
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,590
you met him at his radio show.

125
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,280
You joined my radio show once.

126
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,420
- That's right.
- Right?

127
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,500
- This never happened before.
- Suk Jin remembered.

128
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,400
Suk Jin is the one
who usually forgets.

129
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,220
It's usually the other way around.

130
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,420
- Right.
- Was he on your radio show?

131
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,590
He was a guest on my radio show.

132
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,960
- That's right.
- He was the only guest there.

133
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm sorry I forgot.

134
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,970
See? You almost disappointed me.

135
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,400
- Suk Jin...
- I was disappointed.

136
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,450
- You didn't remember me.
- See? You're disappointed, right?

137
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,380
- I'm really sad.
- That's how other guests feel.

138
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,840
I even remember
what I said back then.

139
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,340
I said he looked like Ha Jung Woo.

140
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,550
- That I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

141
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,690
- I think I said that.
- He was nice to me though.

142
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,150
- I thought he looked like an actor.
- Right.

143
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,550
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

144
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,550
Jukjae, I like your character.

145
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,000
- He doesn't remember.
- I like the forgetful character.

146
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,960
You two should make a song together.

147
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,360
- What?
- "Fake Life" by Jukjae.

148
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,230
- "Fake Life."
- Featuring Ji Suk Jin.

149
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,030
- "Oblivion."
- "Oblivion."

150
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,510
All right.
Today, we will have a race...

151
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,780
with the three captains
who have something to do with stars.

152
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,540
BE'O with "Counting Stars," Jukjae
with "Let's Go See the Stars,"

153
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,910
- Right.
- and Byul's husband, Haha.

154
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,250
(BE'O, Jukjae, Haha)

155
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,760
Gosh, this is...

156
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,410
That's quite far-fetched.

157
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,220
He's back as Zhu Bajie.
He has nothing to do with stars.

158
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,030
- My wife is Byul.
- We have BE'O and Jukjae.

159
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,350
He should be a star.

160
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,360
- He's supposed to be a star.
- Right.

161
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,130
I got the star.

162
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,070
He's the sun. The setting sun.

163
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,500
He's right about that.

164
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,960
- But I have the star.
- He has the star.

165
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,710
This is ridiculous.

166
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,470
First, you need
to choose your teams.

167
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,800
The captains will play
rock-paper-scissors and choose...

168
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,910
- two team members they want.
- Okay.

169
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,670
They will choose one at a time.

170
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,910
I'm so glad we have
BE'O and Jukjae here today.

171
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,050
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors

172
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,530
Rock-paper-scissors.

173
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,780
- Yes.
- You two play again.

174
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,200
Rock-paper-scissors.

175
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,960
BE'O wins.
I want to join BE'O's team.

176
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
- BE'O?
- You're the captain.

177
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,700
- You're the captain.
- What are you saying?

178
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,590
- I also like Jukjae.
- You're the captain, Haha.

179
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,710
- He's the king of kids.
- The king of kids?

180
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,970
- But you're the captain.
- Right.

181
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,470
- Can I choose first?
- Yes.

182
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,580
BE'O goes first.

183
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,510
I'll choose...

184
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,950
So Min, he just looked at you.

185
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,410
- He looked at you.
- He looked this way.

186
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,840
So Min, get ready.

187
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,650
- He looked this way.
- He looked at me.

188
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,050
- Stop it.
- He just gave a glance.

189
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,350
- BE'O, who do you want?
- I think he looked at me.

190
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,150
I'm not good at playing games.

191
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,550
- I'll...
- Okay.

192
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,130
- I'll pick So Min.
- So Min!

193
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,840
- Counting stars
- Why did you glance at Jukjae?

194
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,460
She wants to be on Jukjae's team.

195
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,940
- What?
- No.

196
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,860
I'm sorry.

197
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,470
- No, it's not like that.
- She actually wants Jukjae.

198
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,400
- That makes BE'O look bad.
- Pick again.

199
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,470
- Can I pick again?
- Let's do this again.

200
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,320
- No.
- Pick again.

201
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,840
- BE'O, pick again.
- No. I want BE'O.

202
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
- We can pick again.
- I like BE'O.

203
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,450
- It's all right Namiko.
- I really like BE'O.

204
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,760
Pick again.

205
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,460
- Move over.
- I do like BE'O.

206
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,480
So Min was waiting for Jukjae.

207
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,700
No. I want to be on BE'O's team.

208
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
- Move over.
- It's over.

209
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,030
Move over.

210
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,700
- Can I pick again?
- Pick again.

211
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,770
Pick whomever you want.

212
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,360
I like BE'O. Why would you say that?

213
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,660
You can pick again. It's okay.

214
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,600
I really like BE'O.

215
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,770
- I really do.
- It's okay. Just pick one.

216
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,970
- You don't have to pick me.
- I want Jae Suk.

217
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,400
Okay.

218
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,210
(Jae Suk joins BE'O's team.)

219
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,950
- Someday
- This is really upsetting.

220
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,690
- I'll have one too
- Actually, I decided to pick...

221
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,450
So Min in my car.

222
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,710
- That's too bad.
- Why did you guys ruin it?

223
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,330
All right, I just got a hot pack

224
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,150
My hands were freezing

225
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,660
- This is nice
- Nice

226
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,420
- This is nice
- This is nice

227
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,590
(She lost her hot pack
as well as BE'O.)

228
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,340
The black limousine

229
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,440
You forced him not to pick me.

230
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,300
- That's not true.
- Next up is Jukjae.

231
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,170
- He's up next.
- It's Jukjae.

232
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,170
It's Jukjae's turn now.

233
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,600
Jukjae's turn to pick

234
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
You can join BE'O's team next time.

235
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,080
- Seriously, everyone is...
- This is Jukjae's turn

236
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
- Jukjae is...
- I didn't say anything.

237
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,090
- Jukjae.
- Yes.

238
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,090
I was staying still.

239
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,390
Who do you want to go
see the stars with?

240
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,710
I'll pick Jong Kook.

241
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,910
(I'll pick Jong Kook.)

242
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,630
- Okay.
- This time...

243
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,900
Come on, Jukjae.

244
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,650
- Jukjae.
- Counting stars

245
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,200
- I want to be on BE'O's team.
- Pearls in the night sky

246
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,000
He's my Jukjae.

247
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,960
- You'll get another chance.
- He's so witty.

248
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,270
- Good.
- Okay.

249
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,440
Nice. Jukjae.

250
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,400
He wants to go see
the stars with Jong Kook.

251
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,640
Not with So Min.

252
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,210
He can see the stars
when he works out with me.

253
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,400
- All right. It's Haha.
- Haha.

254
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,200
- Then I'll...
- Who?

255
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,280
So Min.

256
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,250
So Min.

257
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,540
(She hates it.)

258
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,050
Why are you doing this to So Min?

259
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,520
You should go now.

260
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,420
(Dragging)

261
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,490
- Take her.
- Hurry and go.

262
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,130
- You should go to Zhu Bajie.
- Go join Zhu Bajie.

263
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,500
- Go hang out with Zhu Bajie.
- Come here.

264
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,230
(Namiko joins Team Zhu Bajie.)

265
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,330
- They are wearing matching outfits.
- Why are you doing this to me?

266
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,240
Why are you doing this to me?

267
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,170
They are wearing matching outfits.

268
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,430
Gosh, Jeon So Bal.

269
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,670
- Everything is ruined.
- Good.

270
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,650
- This is a mess.
- Right.

271
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,220
It's a total mess.

272
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,570
- They ruined everything for me.
- This is so funny.

273
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,120
Play rock-paper-scissors again.

274
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,390
- Again.
- All right.

275
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,990
Rock-paper-scissors.

276
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,680
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

277
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,990
Okay.

278
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,150
Who do you want?

279
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,820
I want to go see the stars.

280
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,600
(I want to go see the stars.)

281
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,030
(Shaky eyes)

282
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,160
Ji Hyo.

283
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,010
- Ji Hyo wants you.
- Jukjae.

284
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,070
- She wants to go see the stars.
- She said that.

285
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,540
But there's someone else
I want to pick.

286
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,400
- That doesn't matter.
- Really? Go ahead.

287
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,750
Suk Jin.

288
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,350
(Jukjae's choice is Suk Jin.)

289
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

290
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,310
- This is strange.
- Why would you see the stars?

291
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,490
- I want to see the stars.
- I'm sorry.

292
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,420
- I want to go see the stars.
- That's his choice.

293
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,600
Jukjae is funny.

294
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,360
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Jukjae.

295
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,060
- This young man is funny.
- Hey.

296
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,370
At a time like this,

297
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,160
- you should pick Ji Hyo.
- Really?

298
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,660
- Yes.
- It's all right.

299
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,010
Still, this is...

300
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,740
Forget it. I won't see the stars.

301
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,800
- Can I pick now?
- Yes. Who do you want?

302
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
- I want Se Chan.
- Thanks!

303
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,940
We should mix up
the members a little.

304
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,040
- All right then.
- I'm also a star.

305
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,990
- I'm a star too.
- He's also a star.

306
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,650
- Right.
- Ji Hyo, we're also a star.

307
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,360
- I like BE'O.
- Actually,

308
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,680
- I like BE'O.
- you are wearing matching coats.

309
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,550
That's true.
You two look good together.

310
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,030
So we have three teams now.

311
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,730
- I'll explain the rules right away.
- What is it?

312
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,770
Today, we are having the Year-End Party
With Stars Race with stars.

313
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,140
You each will get one card among
3 Star Cards and 6 Poop Cards.

314
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,740
- Okay.
- My nickname is Poop.

315
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,010
- Me too.
- I look like poop.

316
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,440
And the team who gets
2 Star Cards and 1 Poop Card wins.

317
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,310
- All right.
- Two stars and one poop.

318
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,440
The team who has more poop cards
than star cards...

319
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,890
will get a penalty based
on the number of their poop cards.

320
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,310
- So we can't get 3 Poop Cards.
- No 3 Poop Cards.

321
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,630
- We need a Star Card.
- That's the worst.

322
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,630
You will have some missions
during the race.

323
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,860
After the mission,
the 2nd and 3rd places can...

324
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,690
exchange one card
with a team they want.

325
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,370
And the first place can switch
two cards at most.

326
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,740
And each team will be assigned
to different waiting spaces...

327
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,970
based on the number
of Star Cards they hold.

328
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,240
- Waiting spaces?
- Yes.

329
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
The first-place team will get
a warm indoor space.

330
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,650
The second-place team will get
an indoor space with fences.

331
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,040
And the third-place team will get
an outdoor tent.

332
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,250
- No.
- It's cold.

333
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,810
I don't want to catch a cold.

334
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,490
All right. Now you will pick
one card each.

335
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,490
Okay.

336
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,260
We might get 2 stars
and 1 poop right away.

337
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,900
- Right. But we might lose it.
- We can get it right away.

338
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,500
- We might lose it.
- We should fake it.

339
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,370
I'm good at things like this.

340
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,530
- Really?
- Should we keep this a secret?

341
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,770
- Jong Kook, you pick one.
- Me?

342
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,370
All right then.

343
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,430
Look at their faces.

344
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,110
- It's either star or poop, right?
- Yes.

345
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,830
We can't just...

346
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,200
We've been doing
a variety show for so long.

347
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,530
- We can fake it.
- We wouldn't show it.

348
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,400
- You can't read my face.
- I can keep a poker face.

349
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,150
(A poker face)

350
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,670
- Of course.
- Suk Jin can't open it.

351
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,020
- You can't read my face.
- It's a Poop Card.

352
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,580
- Suk Jin got a Poop Card.
- It's a Poop Card.

353
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,020
- No.
- It's definitely a Poop Card.

354
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,990
When Suk Jin opened it,
it reeked of poop.

355
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,230
- Suk Jin got a Poop Card.
- Totally.

356
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,900
- Let's move on to the next team.
- It's us.

357
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,150
- Team BE'O goes first.
- Okay.

358
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,270
BE'O.

359
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,920
- Can't you be nice to us?
- He's a guest.

360
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,600
- Be nice to Zhu Bajie.
- He's a guest.

361
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,030
Pearls in the night sky

362
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,200
Okay.

363
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,530
- What is it?
- You startled me.

364
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,700
Your dad wants to see it.

365
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,250
- Your dad wants to see it.
- Dad, this is...

366
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,540
(Dad, this is...)

367
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,520
- We both got Star Cards.
- One...

368
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,150
- Really?
- One, two, three.

369
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,250
- What's yours?
- I got a Poop Card.

370
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,310
Really?

371
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,520
- We got it.
- I know.

372
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,730
- Aren't I good?
- You are really good.

373
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,630
- It's our turn.
- Okay. Go ahead.

374
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,420
(Team Haha gets
the 3 left-over cards.)

375
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,630
We shouldn't let them see it.

376
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,130
- Let's see.
- We should do the same thing.

377
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,270
All right. One, two, three.

378
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,430
- No!
- My gosh.

379
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,430
What's with my hands?

380
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,040
How is this possible?

381
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,280
I don't know. Did you see it?

382
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,040
So you all are done
choosing your cards.

383
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,040
You will get changed
before the first mission.

384
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,310
Let's go.

385
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,950
- Let's go.
- I should go dress warmly.

386
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,580
- Jukjae.
- Jukjae.

387
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,150
I think he forgot
that we should gather around.

388
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,950
- Jukjae.
- Jukjae.

389
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,690
- I think Jukjae is...
- He's out of his mind.

390
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,500
He's like an old man.

391
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,970
It's all right, Jukjae.

392
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,640
- He's laid-back.
- It's all right. Good.

393
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,100
- He's like an old man.
- He's calm.

394
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,560
He's like a scholar.

395
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,330
It's so nice to have
BE'O and Jukjae here today.

396
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,530
Right.

397
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,700
I didn't think BE'O would be
on a variety show.

398
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,300
- I thought he wasn't interested.
- Me neither.

399
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,310
- I didn't know he'd be on TV shows.
- Some artists don't do TV shows.

400
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,280
He's here because it's Running Man.

401
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,580
- That's why.
- Right.

402
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,650
- It's true, right?
- Yes.

403
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,350
You should say that yourself.

404
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,490
It's true.

405
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,810
Why do you force him?

406
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,420
- What's with him?
- Gaslighting.

407
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,600
- That's one reason, right?
- Yes.

408
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,630
- That's true.
- That's gaslighting.

409
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,360
I can't take his side on this.

410
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,000
This is really nice.

411
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,560
Isn't So Min funny, by the way?

412
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,030
It's funny that she's there.

413
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,030
(It's funny that she's there.)

414
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,010
I don't belong here.

415
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,140
Why did you pick me?

416
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,930
I had to pick her
to go along with the atmosphere.

417
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,610
- I regret it a lot.
- Don't do that.

418
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,650
- Okay.
- I'm so sad.

419
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,120
I find it funny when things
don't go well for So Min.

420
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,020
All right. Here's the first mission.

421
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,810
It's called A Trembling Move.

422
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,860
- Okay.
- A representative of each team...

423
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,080
- will play yukmok, not omok.
- I see.

424
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,230
- How do we do that?
- Since this is yukmok,

425
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,420
- you will place 2 pieces at a time.
- Place 2 pieces?

426
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,400
To place your pieces,
you have to do...

427
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,640
10 squats within 20 seconds.

428
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,480
You have to place your pieces,
come back, and press the button.

429
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,670
If you fail to press
the button in time,

430
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,780
the other team can get rid
of one of your pieces.

431
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,350
- So we have to hurry and do squats.
- Right.

432
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,150
For your information,

433
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,180
Jong Kook will coach you
when you do squats.

434
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,780
- Me?
- If they don't do it properly,

435
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,390
you can say so.

436
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,580
I'm quite strict about this.

437
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,550
Your team member...

438
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,950
- Jong Kook.
- You know me.

439
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,130
I can't go all the way down
because of the structure of my body.

440
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,130
You have to watch
Suk Jin carefully.

441
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,140
I know.

442
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,370
- You know me.
- Watch his posture carefully.

443
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,270
I can't go all the way down.

444
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,610
- BE'O, can you do that?
- Yes.

445
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,740
Good.

446
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,430
Your knees are
sticking out too much.

447
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,980
- Don't do that.
- He's very strict.

448
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,280
- Nice, Mr. Kim.
- You should lean back.

449
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,020
Your body is just like mine.

450
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,250
- You can't do it, can you?
- I can't.

451
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,650
- It's all right.
- He's a human.

452
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,990
You can't use
the squat toilet, right?

453
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,860
- My knees hurt.
- So you can't, can you?

454
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,450
I can't use it either.

455
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,650
I knew it. You can't do this.

456
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,320
So I go like this.

457
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,870
Hey.

458
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,400
Can you really do that?

459
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,970
He's like an old man.

460
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,030
- Like this?
- Hey.

461
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,200
- Does this work?
- Because I can't squat down.

462
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,140
Who would use a toilet like this?

463
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,570
He poops like this.

464
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,980
Do you really do that?

465
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,250
- Does this work?
- I just imagined it.

466
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,150
My goodness.

467
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,150
I imagined it. It's horrible.

468
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,940
So there will be two rounds.

469
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,810
You will play Round One
to switch cards.

470
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,990
And you will play Round Two
to get star coins.

471
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,920
You can use star coins
to check other teams' cards...

472
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,530
or buy food and things you need
in your waiting spaces.

473
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,230
Do we get to hear that?

474
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,970
Now you should discuss with your
team and decide who will go first.

475
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,930
When you play yukmok,
the first player...

476
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,030
can place only one piece.
Only the first time.

477
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,570
If you're too tired to do squats,

478
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,110
you can be substituted once.

479
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,940
- We should let BE'O play first.
- Okay.

480
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,350
- Then we will choose Jukjae.
- I'll go first.

481
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,120
- We have Haha.
- Black limousine

482
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,890
The stars are here.

483
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,260
Haha.

484
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,650
It's all right. I will have
three pieces in my next turn.

485
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,390
You still have one more piece.

486
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,290
- We have one more piece.
- Haha. You're the star.

487
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,600
(Slow)

488
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,770
Thank you.

489
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,270
- Why are you so slow?
- Jukjae.

490
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,690
- It's all right.
- He's a scholar.

491
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,970
- Take your time.
- Jukjae.

492
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,160
- Jukjae, you're so slow.
- Take as much time as you need.

493
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,240
- I can be fast.
- Okay. Just hurry.

494
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,640
That's his character.

495
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,780
I thought...

496
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,440
- he was a sloth.
- He's a scholar.

497
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,350
As I say start,
you press the button...

498
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,980
and do the squats.

499
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Ready.

500
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,540
BE'O, you should place
the red pieces.

501
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,580
You can do this.

502
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,020
Start.

503
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,150
All right.

504
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,310
He's doing it.

505
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,690
- One.
- Why is he so slow?

506
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,780
This is unexpected.

507
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,760
Three, four,

508
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,390
- five, six, seven...
- He's a little...

509
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,670
- He's so laid-back.
- Eight, nine,

510
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,030
- ten.
- Okay.

511
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,330
Five seconds.

512
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,530
- One more.
- He has to press the button.

513
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,240
Four, three...

514
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,560
- Okay.
- Two seconds left.

515
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,180
- It's your turn.
- One.

516
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,950
- Two, three.
- What are you doing? All right.

517
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,280
- Four, five,
- Go further down.

518
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
- six, seven,
- Further down.

519
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,180
eight, nine,

520
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,450
ten. Go.

521
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,780
- He can do it. He made it.
- This is hard.

522
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,280
It's not easy to do it
within the given time.

523
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,420
He has no time to think.

524
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,620
It's too close.

525
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,050
- Okay. Go.
- One.

526
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,320
- two, three,
- Go, Scholar!

527
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,850
- four.
- He's a scholar.

528
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,500
Why are you doing this?

529
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,670
- Six.
- Jukjae.

530
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,890
- My knees hurt.
- Eight, nine.

531
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,470
- It hurts, doesn't it?
- Run.

532
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,970
- Go.
- Gosh.

533
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,330
Hey, you have to hurry.

534
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,530
- Why is he so slow?
- Hey.

535
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,330
- You don't have time.
- Hey.

536
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,410
- Hurry.
- Three.

537
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,540
Two, one.

538
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,210
- My gosh.
- Why is he so slow?

539
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,180
- You should go right away.
- He's a scholar.

540
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,580
- One, two, three...
- That's good.

541
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,690
- Four.
- BE'O got used to doing it.

542
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,490
- Five more to go.
- He's so cute.

543
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,880
- He groaned.
- Six. Seven.

544
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,490
- You all should do more exercise.
- Eight.

545
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,780
- Nine. Ten.
- He...

546
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,190
- He won't ever come back here.
- He always works with a computer...

547
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,550
to make music. That's why.

548
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,860
- That's good.
- Oh, we should stop them.

549
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,090
Good job.

550
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,890
- One, two...
- Hey.

551
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,170
- You're going down too low.
- That's good!

552
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,860
- No, he's doing great.
- Go down lower.

553
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,100
- Hey, do it properly.
- You should go down lower.

554
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,510
- Yes. Do it as you did earlier.
- Lower.

555
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,980
Seven. Eight.

556
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,330
- No, he did all ten squats.
- Did he?

557
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,410
- You don't have time to think.
- We should block the team.

558
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,450
- Decide on your move in advance.
- Right. I'll do that.

559
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,070
- Right. You should think ahead.
- I see.

560
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,720
- Jukjae, you've got this. One.
- It looks exhausting.

561
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,380
Two, three, four, five...

562
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,850
- He must be tired now.
- Then it's over.

563
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,460
Nine. Ten.

564
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,320
- Good. You have enough time.
- There's no need to rush.

565
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,430
- No one has been as relaxed as him.
- He's so laid-back.

566
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,770
- You still have time to think.
- He's adorable.

567
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,090
- Why is he so relaxed?
- Hey, go back now!

568
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,330
- No, you still have time left.
- Hurry up! Three!

569
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,560
- Two, one.
- Two.

570
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,630
- One.
- It's over.

571
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,360
- He's so laid-back.
- Jukjae is relaxed.

572
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,860
He's so laid-back.

573
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,980
- How can he be so relaxed?
- Good. Three.

574
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,510
He's so laid-back.

575
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,910
How can he be so relaxed?

576
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,950
Good. Three.

577
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,300
- Four.
- Good.

578
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,340
(Groaning)

579
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,250
(He faced a crisis
at the beginning of the game.)

580
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,540
- My gosh.
- Good.

581
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,780
- Gosh, you're still very young.
- Keep going.

582
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,460
- He was born in 2000. He's young.
- Nine.

583
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,080
- That's good.
- Are you tired?

584
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,690
- BE'O, that's humane.
- Goodness. He was born in 2000.

585
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,190
- He'll be too exhausted next week.
- That's good.

586
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,320
He was born in 2000.

587
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,550
- What is he doing?
- What? Where should I place them?

588
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,000
- What is he doing?
- What? Where should I place them?

589
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,530
- Where should I...
- Hurry up, BE'O!

590
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,700
- Time's up.
- You should take one out.

591
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,790
(What is wrong with him?)

592
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,830
Take this one out.

593
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,130
Can I place one piece?

594
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,970
- I couldn't place any.
- In that case, you can't.

595
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,210
- I see.
- You should go back.

596
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,510
- My goodness.
- Can't he place any pieces?

597
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,840
- He has no choice.
- Why do you have such weak knees?

598
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,600
- BE'O, how did that happen?
- I'm sorry.

599
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,190
- Well... He's so polite.
- Two, three... Ten.

600
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,640
- Hey, Blowfly!
- We should block the white pieces.

601
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,840
You did quite well, Dong Hoon.

602
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,380
- We should block the white pieces.
- Right, you should.

603
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,810
- The white pieces. That's good.
- You've got this.

604
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,120
- I'm done.
- Three seconds are left.

605
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,430
Jukjae, move faster.
You don't have much time.

606
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,290
- One, two, three...
- Two, three...

607
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,620
- He got faster.
- Jukjae got the hang of it.

608
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,200
- Five... Ten.
- Hey.

609
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
- You have only a few seconds left.
- Take your time.

610
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,120
- Hey, Jukjae...
- You have enough time to think.

611
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,470
- Take your time. Good.
- You're running out of time.

612
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,440
- Six, five, four...
- It's okay. There's no rush.

613
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,030
- Three!
- No. What are you doing?

614
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,630
- Two! One!
- Two! One!

615
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,180
- Okay!
- One!

616
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,530
- Okay!
- You should take one piece out.

617
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,010
- Who should do that?
- Take one piece out.

618
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,370
- No, the other teams should do it.
- Oh, I see.

619
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,680
- Haha, which one should be removed?
- They're at an advantage.

620
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,990
- We should take this one out.
- You shouldn't think too much.

621
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,640
- Okay. This one is out.
- Okay. Done.

622
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,050
- Oh, next up is...
- Is the black piece up next?

623
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,990
- Which team uses black pieces?
- Next up is red. It's our turn.

624
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,490
- Okay. We should block them.
- It's our turn.

625
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,430
- Okay.
- BE'O, what's the matter?

626
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,350
- I'll be okay. Don't worry.
- That line should be blocked.

627
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,350
Se Chan, be careful.
Leave it untied.

628
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,290
- If he's tired, I can replace him.
- One,

629
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,500
- Go down lower.
- two, three, four,

630
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,670
- five, six...
- Spread your knees wider.

631
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,860
Or it might damage your knees.

632
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,440
- I mean, your knees.
- BE'O has reached his limit.

633
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,830
- Nine, ten.
- Nine, ten.

634
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,870
- My gosh.
- Go.

635
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,980
- Ten.
- Go.

636
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,300
(His legs give out.)

637
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,600
Hurry up and place it in the middle.

638
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,870
- This is fun.
- What's wrong with you?

639
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,950
- Between those pieces.
- This is fun.

640
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,180
- Place it between those pieces.
- BE'O!

641
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,190
(The place where the white piece was
before being removed)

642
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,810
- No, between them!
- Between those pieces!

643
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,050
- Hey, time's up.
- No, between those pieces!

644
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,990
- Take one piece out.
- But...

645
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,550
- Take one piece out.
- I'll replace you.

646
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,030
- I'm sorry.
- Sit down here.

647
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,500
- Who should decide?
- Stay seated.

648
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,960
- That was hilarious.
- Hey.

649
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,000
- I mean, it was funny, but...
- I forgot where I should place it.

650
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,170
- I told you...
- I know.

651
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,860
- We'd like to change players.
- Shall I do it?

652
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,910
- We'd like to change players.
- You can do this.

653
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,970
- It's our turn, right?
- Right.

654
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,360
- Who's next?
- It's our turn.

655
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,030
Place two pieces between our pieces
to complete a line.

656
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,130
I'll start.

657
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,710
One, two... That's good. Three.

658
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,110
- He'll grab you. Hit him as you go.
- We should block the red pieces.

659
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,680
- Six. Seven.
- Turn around and hit him.

660
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,070
- That's good.
- Eight.

661
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,750
- Nine. Ten.
- Run.

662
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Good.

663
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,280
(He gave up on the strap
of his bag.)

664
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,850
- It's okay.
- It snapped.

665
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,460
- Good. Great job. Let's go.
- What?

666
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,530
- Is that how you played the pieces?
- Good.

667
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,500
- Oh, no. This is bad.
- Where did he place the pieces?

668
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,730
- What are you going to do?
- It's over.

669
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,730
You should block this line here.

670
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,000
(If Team Red place two pieces here,
the game will end.)

671
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,730
- You should place 1 piece here.
- You can win by putting 2 here.

672
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,740
(It'll also end if Team Black place
two pieces here.)

673
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,010
- Look.
- Why didn't you block the line?

674
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,950
- Suk Jin, let's block it together.
- Who's up next?

675
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,980
- You should block the line.
- Let's work together.

676
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,950
- Team Black will win if I do that.
- It's over.

677
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,310
- Exactly.
- No, you should place it here.

678
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,340
- You should place it here.
- Place one here and the other here.

679
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,690
- Right. You should block the line.
- You should place it here.

680
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,810
- I'll place one here.
- No.

681
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,810
- No. They'll win if you do that.
- Hey, you know, right?

682
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,850
- We'll win either way.
- They'll win if I put it there.

683
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,850
- Place it here.
- No, they'll win.

684
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,700
- If I put it here, they'll win.
- You should block this line.

685
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,590
- You should block this line.
- Listen. You should block that one.

686
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,170
- Hey, Jukjae! Where are our pieces?
- Place it here.

687
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,500
- Place our pieces here.
- You've done nothing.

688
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,700
- All I see is this giyeok shape!
- Just put one here.

689
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,600
- There's no way we can win.
- We need him to place one here.

690
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,510
If we block the black line,
who's next?

691
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,680
- Team Red.
- Team Red is up next.

692
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
- Then we shouldn't do it.
- Right.

693
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,100
- Why?
- Okay. I have an idea.

694
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,180
- We won't place ours there.
- No.

695
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,450
We can block
both of these two lines.

696
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,110
- But then...
- Then they'll block the black line.

697
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,220
- Right. That's a good idea.
- If we block the two lines.

698
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,840
(He plans to join forces with
Team Red to stop Team Black.)

699
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,880
- Then they'll block the black line.
- Right.

700
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,050
- That's a good idea.
- We won't block that line.

701
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,780
- They...
- We won't do that.

702
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,260
(We won't block that line.)

703
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,760
- We won't do that.
- You won't?

704
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,430
- Then you'll lose.
- He's being a jerk again.

705
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,120
- Suk Jin.
- We won't take your team's card.

706
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,890
- We'll do that.
- It's a good offer.

707
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,170
- We won't take your team's card.
- We'll do that.

708
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,530
- Hey, that's not the point.
- Listen, Suk Jin.

709
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,970
- Jukjae, there's no way we can win.
- Help us, not them.

710
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,410
- Jukjae, why did you do a poor job?
- Suk Jin.

711
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,710
You have to make your decision.

712
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,370
- We won't take yours. Are we good?
- That's not what I'm saying.

713
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,780
- Are you serious?
- Place two pieces here and here.

714
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,950
- Okay. Let's do as he asks.
- Then...

715
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,610
- Then we... Of course.
- You should keep your promise.

716
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,310
- It's a deal.
- Hey, we offered the same thing!

717
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,050
- Whatever we do...
- But Suk Jin...

718
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,580
- What about us?
- He may not make it in 20 seconds.

719
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,780
You're wrong. I can do that.

720
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,820
- He can't pull it off? Come on.
- He may not make it.

721
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,790
- I just came out.
- You should do squats properly.

722
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,790
He can do it
since we already made the decision.

723
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,390
- He can pull it off.
- Of course.

724
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,860
- Let's put one here.
- I'll start.

725
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,390
- One.
- What?

726
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,800
That won't do.

727
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,100
- Suk Jin, please.
- Please. You have to pull it off.

728
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,560
- You should go down lower.
- Seven.

729
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,070
- Eight. Nine.
- Good.

730
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,530
- How many seconds are left?
- Ten seconds.

731
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,370
- You have enough time.
- Yes, that's more than enough.

732
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,410
- What's with his stance?
- My gosh.

733
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,750
- You have enough time.
- There.

734
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,280
- My gosh. There.
- You have enough time.

735
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,340
(Suk Jin chose to give up
for the sake of Team Red.)

736
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,380
- What are you doing?
- There.

737
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,260
- That's not cool.
- It doesn't matter to us anyway.

738
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,530
- Five, six... Nine, ten.
- You're good at it.

739
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,550
It doesn't matter.

740
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,230
- All right.
- We had no chance anyway.

741
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,200
(Team Red completed
a line of six pieces.)

742
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,090
- Okay.
- It's over.

743
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,860
- We had to accept his offer.
- Team BE'O won.

744
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,240
- Okay!
- Gosh, seriously.

745
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,500
- Hey, keep your promise.
- Then we'll...

746
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,910
calculate the probability
based on the possible moves.

747
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,180
- Team Haha placed second.
- It's us.

748
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,870
- Team Jukjae placed third.
- That's not fair.

749
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,280
- How would you know?
- You placed the pieces randomly.

750
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,480
- Then let's keep playing.
- Let's see how it ends.

751
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,750
- I didn't know you'd rank us too.
- Of course, they ranked us too.

752
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,870
- I wouldn't have placed them here.
- Of course, they ranked us too.

753
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,610
Suk Jin, why did you do that?

754
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,040
- You could've placed second.
- You should've blocked their line.

755
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,280
- Then you would've placed second.
- Why did you put them here?

756
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,260
- To move fast. We had no chance.
- Did you hear what Jae Suk said?

757
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,230
- We had no chance to win anyway.
- After all that happened.

758
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,820
- That's so funny.
- It was going to end anyway.

759
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,890
He asked why Suk Jin did so
after all that happened.

760
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,270
When I joined the same team as him,
I gave up on winning.

761
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,440
- As soon as the teams were decided.
- We're in second place.

762
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,300
In Round 2, the team in 1st place
will get 7 star coins.

763
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,280
The 2nd place will get 5 star coins,
and the 3rd place will get 3.

764
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,410
- That sounds good.
- Ji Hyo will play in this round.

765
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,680
- So Min.
- Yes.

766
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,480
From our team, So Min will play.

767
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,950
- Me?
- Yes.

768
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,450
- Suk Jin, continue to play. Yes.
- Shall I?

769
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,520
- Hey, your jacket...
- They'll understand you.

770
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,920
- I'll do it.
- Play as long as you can.

771
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,990
- I think I can beat these two.
- I can replace you later. Right.

772
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,050
- So Min, you...
- The time limit is too short.

773
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,690
So Min,
do not place pieces apart like this.

774
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,620
- That's stupid.
- Try to put them together.

775
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,500
- Like this.
- Hey, I know that much.

776
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,560
- Do you really know?
- Yes.

777
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,170
- So Min, we're rooting for you.
- They lower my self esteem.

778
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,830
- What do you mean?
- That's not true. You're pretty.

779
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,600
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Hey, don't do that to So Min.

780
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,330
- She's so pretty.
- "She's pretty?"

781
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,980
Okay. Rock-paper-scissors.

782
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,280
Rock-paper-scissors, okay.

783
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,980
- I won.
- Hey, what are you good at?

784
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,520
- Get it together!
- You should've at least won that.

785
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,990
Stop nagging me already. Gosh.

786
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,950
(Frog lost her temper in the end.)

787
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,920
- That was good.
- Good job!

788
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,310
- The order is...
- You're pretty!

789
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,430
- Suk Jin, So Min, and Ji Hyo.
- You're so pretty. You're hip!

790
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,000
- Got it.
- You look so young!

791
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,890
- I can do it. I work out at home.
- Good.

792
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:35,930
That's great.

793
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,060
- I'll check the time.
- She looks so young.

794
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,790
- One, two...
- That's good. Oh, my.

795
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,790
- Three.
- Great. You look so strong.

796
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,360
- Five, six...
- Suk Jin, that's too much.

797
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,440
- Don't push your hips forward.
- Can you blur him?

798
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,680
- Is that the correct stance?
- Don't push your hips forward...

799
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,800
Is that right, Ji Hyo?

800
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,180
My, he's good at it.

801
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
That's good.

802
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,640
- I still have five seconds left.
- He's so healthy.

803
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,040
- You did a great job.
- Of course.

804
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,520
- He's better than Jukjae and BE'O.
- You did a great job.

805
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,420
- Faster. Two, three...
- So Min, what are you doing?

806
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,420
My gosh. What are you doing?

807
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,660
- Hey, what is that?
- I'm relieved.

808
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,850
- Seven.
- What is she doing?

809
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,960
- Look at her.
- What is that?

810
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,390
- Seven. Eight.
- What is she doing?

811
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,230
- Hurry up!
- What is she doing?

812
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,130
- Hurry! Run now.
- Hurry! Run.

813
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,240
- Move faster. Hurry up.
- What was that?

814
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,170
- Go back now. Go.
- Run.

815
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,210
- That was cute.
- Hurry up.

816
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,800
- Okay. She's so bad at it.
- What was that?

817
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,210
- Why are you so bad at it?
- She's so slow.

818
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,410
- It's diagonal, right?
- Yes, it is.

819
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,070
- Three.
- Go down lower!

820
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,190
- Lower.
- Ten.

821
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,880
Ji Hyo.

822
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,610
Don't think too much.
Put two pieces anywhere you want.

823
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,690
- Wait. What is she doing?
- Good.

824
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,780
- Press the button.
- Nice.

825
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,120
- Nice!
- Okay.

826
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,260
Go ahead. Start now.

827
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,620
- One, two, three, four, five...
- That's good.

828
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,930
- He's amazing.
- He'll ache all over tomorrow.

829
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,630
- You're incredible.
- You're such a tough guy!

830
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,890
- Ten.
- Okay!

831
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,630
- Ten.
- Okay!

832
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,330
(He's full of energy.)

833
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,800
- You're amazing.
- Good job.

834
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,410
- I have some time left.
- So Min, move as fast as you can.

835
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,410
- You should go far away.
- Move fast. One.

836
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,840
- What is your problem?
- Hey!

837
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,280
- I'm so relieved.
- What is that?

838
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,960
- Two.
- I mean...

839
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,930
- What is wrong with her?
- Move faster! Keep it together!

840
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,320
- Hurry up!
- You don't have time for that. Run!

841
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,290
- Hurry. Place pieces here.
- What is wrong with her?

842
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,290
- Hurry up and go back. Run.
- Go.

843
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,860
- What is wrong with So Min?
- You should've gone far away.

844
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,290
- You're so funny.
- That's not a good move.

845
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,940
I thought it was strange.

846
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,240
- You're running out of time.
- Nice.

847
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,670
- Just put them there. Good.
- That was good.

848
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,910
- We should block the line for now.
- Move.

849
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,980
- Yes, block the line.
- We should block all of them.

850
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,950
- Gosh. We don't get to attack.
- Good. Okay.

851
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,980
- Just put it there. Good.
- Good job.

852
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,420
At the end of the white line. Good.

853
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
And place the other one
anywhere you want.

854
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,580
- You're running out of time.
- Good.

855
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,610
That's good. Let's keep attacking.

856
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,310
- Perfect.
- It's over.

857
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,580
We should block both ends.

858
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,580
(Team Black made a line
of five pieces!)

859
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,760
If you don't block it, they'll win.

860
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
- BE'O, do you want to do it?
- Yes, I'll do it.

861
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,000
- Okay. You do it.
- Okay. Go ahead.

862
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,890
Oh, my. I didn't think
this would be this fun.

863
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,590
My gosh. It's going on for longer
than I thought.

864
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,130
- They'll win if you don't block it.
- It's going on for so long.

865
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,590
But we have a chance to win too,
BE'O.

866
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,470
- Eight. Nine.
- He's run out of energy.

867
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,940
Hey, he looks exhausted.

868
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,480
- They'll win if you don't block it.
- We should block both ends.

869
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,250
- Block both ends of this line.
- Hey, hurry up.

870
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,800
Yes, that's good. Go back.

871
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,340
- Suk Jin.
- Okay.

872
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,340
(Next up is Suk Jin.)

873
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,110
Three. Four.

874
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,690
- They need to stretch the line.
- Seven.

875
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,460
- We should block the line.
- Suk Jin, block this line.

876
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,660
- Add pieces to the white line.
- Which one should I block?

877
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,920
- You should block this line.
- Let's attack.

878
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,730
- That's right.
- My gosh. Are you serious?

879
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,960
- Okay. Go back now.
- We should block the black line.

880
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,970
- We have to attack this time.
- You should block the red line.

881
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,360
There's a line of five white pieces.

882
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,000
- Five white pieces in a row.
- Who's next?

883
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,170
Isn't it Team Red?

884
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,830
Let's just go our separate ways.
I don't even know anymore.

885
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,630
- Go our separate ways?
- Then it'll be over.

886
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,940
- No. You can block this red line...
- Team Red is up next.

887
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,070
- or that white line.
- The white line has five pieces.

888
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,950
- We blocked it in the end.
- It's over now.

889
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,250
- Team Red, you can block it.
- It's over.

890
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,540
- Help us place second at least.
- Team Red has no chance.

891
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,780
- Team Red, you can block it.
- We can add two pieces to our line.

892
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,840
- Come on.
- We can win with two pieces.

893
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,220
- We can win with two pieces.
- Don't do that.

894
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,880
- Can't you block that line instead?
- I should've played.

895
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,960
- Okay.
- Hurry. We can win with two pieces.

896
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,730
(All BE'O has to do is
place pieces just as he was told.)

897
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,640
(Will Team Red win like this?)

898
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,920
- Yes... No! Hey, BE'O!
- Yes!

899
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,770
- Okay!
- Hurry up and play our pieces.

900
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,300
- Why?
- You should've put it here.

901
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,690
- My gosh.
- You should've put it here.

902
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,200
- BE'O, you should've put it here.
- That was unexpected.

903
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,670
- My gosh. What?
- Right here.

904
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,110
- Eight.
- We would've won.

905
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,130
Go now. Suk Jin.

906
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,310
- We'll win if I complete it, right?
- Yes.

907
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,700
- Gosh. I can't believe this.
- My gosh.

908
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,020
- Yes!
- The second place...

909
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,710
(Team White completed
a line of six pieces.)

910
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,380
- Go and press the button.
- Yes!

911
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,680
(It's not over yet.)

912
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,320
- Then the second place...
- That was close.

913
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,830
- Hey, come here, BE'O.
- I'm sorry.

914
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,950
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't see...

915
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,120
- the empty space.
- Don't you want a black limousine?

916
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,190
- Don't you? Why would you do that?
- My gosh.

917
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,070
- That was unexpected.
- The second round is over.

918
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,430
The teams that placed 2nd and 3rd
in the 1st round...

919
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,730
- can exchange one card.
- I see.

920
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,730
The team that placed 1st can exchange
2 cards at the end.

921
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,470
- We go 1st?
- Shall we exchange a card 1st?

922
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,900
Yes, you go first.

923
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,320
- Hold on.
- It's pointless to do so now.

924
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,580
- How about we pick that team?
- It's pointless to do so now.

925
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,050
- Let's use the coins at the end.
- At the end?

926
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,860
- To check the cards. Not now.
- I agree.

927
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,020
Okay.

928
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,330
I was going to choose BE'O's.

929
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,480
(He exchanged his card with BE'O's.)

930
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,680
- I'll check it.
- Okay.

931
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,650
Team Jukjae also exchanged
their card with another.

932
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,330
- You can check it now.
- It seemed hard.

933
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,720
What? Oh, it's the other side.

934
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,630
- It must be a Poop Card.
- I can tell it's not a Star Card.

935
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,730
- I could just tell by his face.
- Gosh. Suk Jin...

936
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,670
It was written on his face.

937
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,700
(Seok Sam picked the only Poop Card
that Team BE'O had.)

938
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,850
- Now, the team in the second place.
- It was written on his face.

939
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,670
You can exchange cards
with any of the other teams.

940
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,710
We should exchange a card
no matter what.

941
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,090
- Nice.
- Nice.

942
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,520
- Bring it to us.
- Bring it here.

943
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
(They picked Team BE'O
that had two Star Cards.)

944
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,980
Haha, I'll count to three
and open it, okay?

945
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,120
- One.
- Come on!

946
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,620
(Did they finally obtain
a Star Card?)

947
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,920
(Grunting)

948
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,830
They looked genuinely upset.
I don't they faked it.

949
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,130
The team in the 1st place
can exchange up to 2 cards.

950
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,270
- Two cards?
- Yes.

951
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,700
Okay.

952
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,540
Which team? Choose the team first.

953
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,200
Could they exchange one
with each team?

954
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,550
(Staring)

955
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,850
Didn't you promise
you wouldn't take ours?

956
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,440
That's right.

957
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,820
- I almost forgot about it.
- Suk Jin is right.

958
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,910
- Yes, they did.
- Didn't you make that promise?

959
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,950
I think you did.

960
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,020
Well, I did promise that, but...

961
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,220
- What do you mean?
- "I did promise that, but..."

962
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,920
I mean, we need to improve
our chances of getting Star Cards.

963
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,830
- We'll pick the other team for now.
- Okay.

964
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,830
- That team.
- Us?

965
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,390
- Us? Okay. I'll shuffle them.
- Yes. Please shuffle the cards.

966
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,920
- BE'O picked good cards earlier.
- Right. BE'O, pick one card.

967
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,220
- Okay.
- If you pick one,

968
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,930
- I'll pick another.
- BE'O, why are you limping?

969
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,070
- No, I'm not.
- Are you okay?

970
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,010
- You're giving us that card?
- I don't know which one it is.

971
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,430
- That one? Are you sure? Okay.
- Okay.

972
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,730
Take it. Go.

973
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,610
One more.
Ji Hyo, let's exchange one more.

974
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,900
(Glancing)

975
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,410
You picked them after all.
It's just that you picked us first.

976
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,210
No way. Are you going to exchange
your card for ours?

977
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,710
- Are you going to pick us?
- I'm sorry.

978
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,950
We have no choice. I'm sorry.

979
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,220
- I'm just curious.
- It's understandable.

980
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,180
I mean, your team placed first
thanks to us.

981
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,920
- True. I'm sorry.
- I placed our pieces...

982
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,530
- right here, you know.
- Are you apologizing?

983
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,920
- I put two pieces here.
- He's apologizing.

984
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
- You should accept his apology.
- Right. He has no choice.

985
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,390
I'm not doing it to keep my promise.
Another member will do.

986
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,230
That doesn't mean anything.
You are all on the same team.

987
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,840
- I'm sorry.
- I mean...

988
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,310
- He apologized.
- I'm sorry.

989
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,110
- Bow your head.
- I apologize.

990
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,810
- You two apologize as well.
- I'm sorry.

991
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,010
- I'm sorry.
- My gosh.

992
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,170
Since when did you allow this
just because we apologize?

993
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,580
- It's been a while.
- My gosh.

994
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,820
That was neat.

995
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,520
- All teams have exchanged cards.
- Let's check it.

996
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,950
- We counted the stars you have.
- Yes.

997
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,480
The team in the first place that'll
enjoy all supplies they need...

998
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,830
- staying warm inside is...
- Is there a winning team?

999
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,330
- Team BE'O.
- What?

1000
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
- Really?
- Yes.

1001
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,120
- They must have Star-Poop-Star.
- I think that's the case.

1002
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,930
The team
that's lucky to stay inside is...

1003
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,040
- Team Jukjae.
- Nice.

1004
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,660
The team
that will stay in a tent outside...

1005
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,580
- in the cold is...
- You can't mistreat us like this.

1006
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,610
(They have to stay outside
where a cold wind is blowing.)

1007
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,870
Team Haha.

1008
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,750
- Now, you can enjoy yourselves...
- Right.

1009
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,550
with your team members.

1010
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,750
- But...
- Let's go!

1011
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,640
- We're in the last place.
- Okay.

1012
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,710
This is where we... How nice.

1013
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,590
What? Where should we go?
Oh, this is it.

1014
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,830
My, this is so nice.

1015
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,920
Oh, my. Our place is so nice.

1016
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,560
(Cozy)

1017
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,300
Hey, we have ramyeon here too.
That's great.

1018
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,190
Jae Suk,
would you like to have some ramyeon?

1019
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,190
(The best place
with various snacks and amenities)

1020
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,890
I'm full, but shall I have some?

1021
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,840
- Well, we just...
- That looks like...

1022
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,270
Are we puppies or what?

1023
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,230
- We're not puppies. What is this?
- Oh, this is all you have.

1024
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,130
- My goodness.
- Are we puppies or what?

1025
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,440
Can we go in with our shoes on?

1026
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,110
- Yes, you can.
- My gosh. Our place is so nice.

1027
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,470
- Is this where we're staying?
- Are we puppies or what?

1028
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,820
It's not so bad.
There's a carpet on the floor. It's nice.

1029
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,790
- Oh, my.
- What are they doing out there?

1030
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,320
Oh, boy.

1031
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,120
- Then we...
- Hey, guys.

1032
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,220
Yes!

1033
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,060
- The guys outside.
- They have to make a fire.

1034
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,950
Gosh. We have nothing here.

1035
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,030
(It's just a yard.)

1036
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,500
Hey, this is...
You guys are so mean.

1037
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,500
(The bottled water froze
as the temperature is below zero.)

1038
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,130
- Is a dream where you pee good?
- Of course.

1039
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,200
How about a dream where your poop is
as big as a radish?

1040
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,170
That's a good dream.
You should buy a lottery.

1041
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,850
- Haha.
- Yes?

1042
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,250
I heard that we're allowed to do it.

1043
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,580
What's that?
Are we having lunch here?

1044
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,210
What should we do here?

1045
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,710
Until the next mission begins,
chop firewood, start a fire,

1046
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,710
and cook sweet potatoes.

1047
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,120
We can move to another team
if we pay 100 dollars in cash.

1048
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,420
- We can move to another team?
- Yes.

1049
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,450
You can't move to another team.

1050
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,560
Can I pay by Kakao Pay?

1051
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,450
They want to send me
to another team.

1052
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,420
- That's not true, So Min. Nonsense.
- So Min.

1053
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,030
- First...
- Let's cook some sweet potatoes.

1054
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,300
- Se Chan, chop the firewood.
- Yes?

1055
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,130
- Okay. I'll do that.
- I'll start a fire.

1056
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,500
- I'm good at starting a fire.
- Gosh, I'm so cold.

1057
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,170
- So Min, that's not how it works.
- You're doing it wrong.

1058
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,100
- You've never done it before.
- Hold on.

1059
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
I'll start a fire
and let you do the rest.

1060
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,750
We need some paper too.
Oh, there it is.

1061
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,420
(Se Chan is going to use the paper
as kindling.)

1062
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,120
(So Min tries to light
the piece of wood on fire again.)

1063
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,190
- No, So Min. What are you doing?
- So Min.

1064
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,420
I told you, that's not how it works.

1065
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,150
I'm trying to ignite...

1066
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,630
- You should put it on top of this.
- I know. I'm just...

1067
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,960
- trying to ignite it first.
- No. That's not how you do it.

1068
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
- Stop. We should stack them first.
- Don't do that.

1069
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,330
- I said it wasn't the right way.
- So Min.

1070
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,600
We can do it this way.

1071
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,310
- What's wrong with her?
- We have to stack them first.

1072
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,670
- Like this.
- Stack the wood first.

1073
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,480
- Stop it. Gosh, it's hot.
- It's on fire. Stack them now.

1074
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,170
So Min, it's dangerous.
You should stay away.

1075
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,420
We should let air go through them,
So Min.

1076
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,920
Why are you guys doing this to me?
Why would you call my name only?

1077
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,120
So Min, stay away.

1078
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,880
Look.
It's not getting enough air, So Min.

1079
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,350
- Give me that. I'll put it in here.
- It hurts my eyes.

1080
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,520
I said not to do it like that.

1081
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,750
- I'm just putting it...
- It needs enough air.

1082
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,330
- Hey!
- I put it under there.

1083
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,460
You can't start a fire like that.

1084
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,630
Just put it under the wood.
Like this.

1085
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,130
- I mean...
- Let's start over again.

1086
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,400
- We have to do it all over again.
- No. I said it was burning.

1087
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,710
- Be careful. We should put it out.
- Only the paper is on fire.

1088
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,330
You're not doing it the right way.
What did I just say?

1089
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,150
- He's right, So Min.
- They say everything is wrong.

1090
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,400
- Sorry?
- Whatever she does is wrong to you.

1091
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,750
Whatever I do,
they say I do it the wrong way.

1092
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,120
That's not true. It's not like that.

1093
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,810
Among those who go camping often,
Haha is the best.

1094
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,850
This is crazy. You'd be the only one
to survive on "Law of the Jungle."

1095
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,330
- Yes. I've done this on the show.
- I think so.

1096
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,730
- Really?
- He's right.

1097
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,330
- He's done this on the show too.
- Yes.

1098
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,230
Actually, I had a meeting with them,
but they didn't cast me.

1099
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,230
Why?

1100
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,560
I don't know.
They didn't tell me the reason.

1101
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,900
- Really?
- I didn't know that could happen.

1102
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,330
- They rarely refuse to cast anyone.
- I know.

1103
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,830
So Min, how about we start a fire
while you're gone?

1104
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,580
Come back when we say,
"Princess So Min will enter." Okay?

1105
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,810
- That sounds great.
- Right? What do you say?

1106
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,380
She'll look like
the star of the day.

1107
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,810
Do you want to do that or not?

1108
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
I don't want to do it.

1109
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,120
Wait. It looks good.

1110
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,650
Okay. Good.
That piece of wood caught fire.

1111
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,400
- Good. Wait.
- So Min, we're...

1112
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,650
(So Min's wood)

1113
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,520
- We're trying to make it work.
- No, put it away.

1114
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,920
- Done.
- Okay. Stay away, So Min.

1115
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,940
It's burning now.

1116
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,940
(Sad)

1117
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,230
Don't be upset.
We didn't mean to upset you.

1118
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,100
- It's burning now.
- So Min did all the work.

1119
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,330
(Haha teases her.)

1120
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,380
Do you do this to Song Yi too?

1121
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,380
(While the members of the team
in the last place are squabbling...)

1122
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,290
I think
there's food in the fridge too.

1123
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,480
- What? Hey.
- Oh, my.

1124
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,440
- My goodness.
- Nice.

1125
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,310
(There's a lot of food
in the fridge.)

1126
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,330
- My goodness.
- Nice.

1127
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,630
- Gosh.
- What is it?

1128
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,350
You look so jealous right now.

1129
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,020
I wanted to know
what was in the fridge.

1130
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,900
Jae Suk, there's this ramyeon.

1131
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,940
Come on, mister.
Let's not be this way.

1132
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,190
They also have coffee.

1133
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,000
- Don't you want some coffee?
- We should move the rack.

1134
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,000
- Don't you want some coffee?
- We should move the rack.

1135
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,000
Hold on.

1136
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,900
- You can't.
- We can't have you stealing.

1137
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,900
Unbelievable.

1138
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,880
This is nice though.
Look at them in comparison.

1139
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,440
BE'O, are you good
at cooking ramyeon?

1140
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,980
I'm not.

1141
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,440
(I can't cook it well.)

1142
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,920
Is there anything you can do?

1143
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,960
(BE'O isn't good at anything.)

1144
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,520
All you can do
is release great songs.

1145
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,850
- Three packets of ramyeon?
- Sure, let's have three.

1146
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,230
- Let's cook three, then.
- Sure.

1147
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,100
(They start cooking the ramyeon.)

1148
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,500
- Should I add them all in?
- Yes.

1149
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,130
- You're making ramyeon.
- Of course.

1150
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,270
- Are you cooking ramyeon?
- Yes, ramyeon.

1151
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,130
That looks delicious.

1152
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,150
How many star coins
for some ramyeon?

1153
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,310
Will you cook some for us?

1154
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,880
- In exchange for coins?
- How much is a ramyeon worth?

1155
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,520
Can we get three ramyeon for a coin?

1156
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,460
For two coins, you can have ramyeon,
Americano, and whatever you want.

1157
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,020
- Really?
- That sounds like a decent deal.

1158
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,400
We have seven coins right now.

1159
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
You must really want some.

1160
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,630
- He really wants some.
- I...

1161
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,020
- Excuse me.
- One for one.

1162
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,040
We can spare one coin.

1163
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,500
That'll get you an Americano.

1164
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,560
How about an Americano
and an instant cup ramyeon?

1165
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,670
We'll get you
an instant cup ramyeon.

1166
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,670
(They agree to pay a coin for coffee
and an instant cup ramyeon.)

1167
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,500
- Here.
- Is this necessary though?

1168
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,310
- Hold on a second.
- Hey.

1169
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,350
- The hot water.
- At least give us hot water.

1170
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,480
Come on.

1171
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,750
Pour this coffee in it.

1172
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,020
(Pour this coffee in it.)

1173
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,850
(Jukjae sips
the coffee they obtained.)

1174
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,190
They must not be able to see us
from out there.

1175
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,000
I think that's the case.

1176
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,020
(Are two sips all that he's having?)

1177
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,440
This is the cup ramyeon
that Son Heung Min promotes.

1178
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,560
(He slowly walks over to the others
looking for something.)

1179
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,000
It's the brand that he promotes.

1180
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,500
All I need is some water.

1181
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,580
Son Heung Min's everywhere
these days.

1182
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,730
Absolutely.

1183
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,880
(Looking around)

1184
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,500
- Heung Min...
- If I were an advertiser...

1185
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,170
What can I get you?

1186
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,440
- This is cold brew coffee.
- And?

1187
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,290
He must not want it.

1188
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,960
- You don't drink cold brew?
- Cold brew isn't his jam.

1189
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,790
You're a fussy one, aren't you?

1190
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,980
You're quite picky.

1191
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,750
Can't I get
an espresso-based coffee?

1192
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,400
Jae Suk, come on.

1193
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,000
- Okay, fine.
- Get him something else.

1194
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,230
How about this, then?

1195
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,400
It's black coffee.

1196
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,130
- Give him that instead.
- That.

1197
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,170
- That isn't coffee though.
- We want our money back.

1198
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,710
We want our money back.
Just forget about it.

1199
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,330
- I'll give you hot water.
- What?

1200
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,400
Hot water.

1201
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
- I'll give you hot water.
- Sure thing.

1202
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,150
- You asked for some.
- Is that how it goes?

1203
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,920
- Sure, get me some water.
- Hot water.

1204
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,690
(Oh no!)

1205
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,580
(The cup ramyeon drops.)

1206
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,420
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

1207
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,960
What do you think you're doing?

1208
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,020
- I...
- I'm sorry.

1209
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,900
How did this even happen?

1210
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,690
Let's clean this up.

1211
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,000
When things seem hard for us...

1212
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,830
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

1213
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,400
- Look at the window.
- Of course.

1214
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,400
- They're burning firewood.
- See?

1215
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,130
They're burning firewood.
Jukjae, check them out.

1216
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,380
When things get hard for us,
watch them instead.

1217
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,080
- We should be happy.
- Look.

1218
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,120
So Min, I only say this
because it's dangerous.

1219
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,420
- So Min, wait.
- It caught on fire.

1220
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,620
- It caught on fire.
- It's dangerous, that's all.

1221
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,080
- Wait behind the camera.
- Hold on.

1222
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,290
It might explode.

1223
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,020
I think there's treasure
hidden over there.

1224
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,690
So Min, come on.
Let's get some twigs.

1225
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,690
- So Min.
- Yes?

1226
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,960
Let's get some twigs.

1227
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,230
(Se Chan tries to lure So Min away.)

1228
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,230
- No?
- Go ahead.

1229
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,830
No, let's go together.

1230
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,500
- Getting twigs sounds like fun.
- Tell me about it.

1231
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,190
- It'll burn better with some.
- Go ahead without me.

1232
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,500
So Min, come on.

1233
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,210
Come on.

1234
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,440
(The Fellowship of the Twigs)

1235
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,040
We'll bring more twigs.

1236
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,150
(In the meantime,
Haha tries to light the fire.)

1237
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,270
Twigs? I don't see any.

1238
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,440
- Here.
- Hold on.

1239
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,480
Collect these instead.

1240
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,920
So Min, these will do.

1241
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,040
These will burn well.

1242
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,060
- Se Chan.
- Yes?

1243
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,880
- We're good. How much do you have?
- What's this?

1244
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,850
What's this?

1245
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:05,690
- It's poop.
- Darn it.

1246
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,290
Shoot.

1247
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,690
(So Min picked up nature's fuel.)

1248
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,600
(Being sick)

1249
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,600
Hurry on over.

1250
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,080
(Poop Girl runs to someplace else.)

1251
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,500
- Haha!
- She picked poop up.

1252
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,310
- Haha.
- Yes?

1253
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,500
Haha...

1254
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,210
(She returns cheerfully
with a tree branch.)

1255
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,810
Cut that up with the ax.

1256
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,040
Enjoy the ramyeon while you can.

1257
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,380
He's right about that.

1258
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,790
Later on, we could be the ones
trying to light a fire.

1259
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,560
- Would you like to sit here?
- I'm good where I am.

1260
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,730
(My gosh!)

1261
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,060
When someone is cooking ramyeon,

1262
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,400
it's best not to intervene.

1263
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,870
Ramyeon always delivers.

1264
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,230
(No way)

1265
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,810
Jukjae, can you play
the guitar for us?

1266
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,810
He can't do it for free, you know.

1267
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,000
You can't request that
after moving the snacks over there.

1268
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,310
I don't think I can...

1269
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,420
play the guitar for free.

1270
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,350
- Right?
- I mean...

1271
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,480
You should at least
offer him something.

1272
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,290
I'll give him what he wants
if he chooses to play.

1273
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,790
Go ahead and play something.

1274
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,730
I wouldn't let him be
if he went back on his word.

1275
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,230
(I wouldn't let him be
if he went back on his word.)

1276
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,500
Jong Kook, seriously.

1277
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,670
- Must you threaten me like that?
- Gosh.

1278
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:18,190
I'm just saying. That's all.

1279
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,830
- That could be us later on.
- Right.

1280
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,870
Let's not be too harsh.

1281
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,900
You must start off with "Romance."

1282
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,850
- Sure. We'll start with "Romance."
- Start off with "Romance."

1283
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,480
- Let me play it for you.
- Seriously?

1284
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,020
- What the...
- "Romance."

1285
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,190
Unbelievable.

1286
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,650
- But he's not the real deal.
- It's all right.

1287
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,620
That's not how it should be.

1288
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,190
That's not how it should be.

1289
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,790
No way. Jukjae, I can't accept this.

1290
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,290
What do you mean?
It sounds the same. You try it.

1291
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,100
- Of course, it's different.
- I'm a musician too, you know.

1292
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,770
I may not be qualified,
but I know the sound of good music.

1293
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,460
It's different.

1294
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,770
- It sure is different.
- It is.

1295
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,600
(That's what I'm talking about!)

1296
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,600
- It's different.
- It's totally different.

1297
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,770
- There's a sharpness to it.
- And it's emotional.

1298
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,580
- Isn't it different?
- It is.

1299
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,080
- Isn't it different?
- It sure is.

1300
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,940
Like I said,
I can tell what quality music is.

1301
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,920
No wonder he's a professional.

1302
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,690
(Absorbed in the music)

1303
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,150
- Again, from the top.
- Not so fast.

1304
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,330
- What can we get?
- Give us something.

1305
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,900
Come on. It can't be for free.

1306
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,330
Was that a one-minute preview?

1307
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,770
- What the...
- It was a one-minute preview.

1308
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,400
- What is this?
- A one-minute preview.

1309
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,190
- Was that a one-minute preview?
- It was.

1310
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,670
Get us something for that.

1311
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,230
- Jukjae, hold on.
- That's it.

1312
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,330
Come on.

1313
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,630
(Chocolate)

1314
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,880
- That's it.
- Good.

1315
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,000
We should only be having
Ghana Chocolate!

1316
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,150
Here. Can you play
something else now?

1317
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,480
- Good.
- That was a good deal.

1318
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,690
Nice.

1319
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,020
Is there a piece
you'd like to request?

1320
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,690
Can you play a song by Sting?

1321
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,650
- Sting?
- That's right.

1322
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,190
Hold on a second.

1323
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,350
What were the chords again?

1324
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,290
Are you attempting
"Shape of My Heart?"

1325
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,290
(He's touched.)

1326
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,230
(Jukjae the jukebox
plays anything upon request.)

1327
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,000
(Ji Hyo has become a fan.)

1328
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,750
- Your minute is up.
- Play a bit more, will you?

1329
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,540
- Seriously?
- Forget it.

1330
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,540
I'll take the minute.

1331
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,880
Play for a minute
and be done with it.

1332
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,750
- I've had it with you.
- A one-minute preview.

1333
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,420
- It's your one-minute preview.
- That's just wrong.

1334
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,690
- Give us something else.
- I won't allow it.

1335
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,650
An artist shouldn't have to starve.

1336
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,850
- A minute is too short.
- You can't...

1337
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,350
- That's his talent.
- Hear us out.

1338
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,350
His talent isn't for free.

1339
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,370
You can't hear anything
if you don't pay for it.

1340
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,040
We already paid
for your service though.

1341
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,630
They won't pay
for the music service.

1342
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,210
- We'll present something.
- Sure. What will it be?

1343
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,480
How about "Limousine?"

1344
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,630
Fine, but how...

1345
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,880
- When nothing is prepared for him?
- What?

1346
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,310
- Will he just sing it?
- Hold on.

1347
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,620
It seems to be news to BE'O.

1348
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,170
All Jukjae needs is a guitar,
and all BE'O needs is a mic.

1349
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,380
A mic?

1350
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,810
- Does it work?
- Of course.

1351
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,210
- I can't hear him though.
- Go ahead.

1352
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,650
The black limousine

1353
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,560
(The black limousine)

1354
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,790
The black limousine

1355
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,600
(The sound comes from his throat.)

1356
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,830
What on earth was that?

1357
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,920
- Are you sure about this?
- You croaked like a crow.

1358
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,670
What's wrong with this mic?

1359
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,130
- What's wrong?
- What's the matter with it?

1360
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,440
Mic testing. Hold on.

1361
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,440
(Mic testing)

1362
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
That's how it should be.

1363
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,480
And then it's night in the fall

1364
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,810
Can't you sing when we request it?

1365
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,580
- You're doing great.
- Don't sing whenever you want...

1366
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,620
and sing upon request.

1367
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,750
- My eyes sting.
- Mine too. I'm tearing up.

1368
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,120
(The team in last place
is inhaling the smoke.)

1369
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,480
How can it be so different for us?

1370
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,880
Exactly.

1371
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,580
BE'O's performing for them.

1372
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,380
I'm so jealous.

1373
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm jealous too.

1374
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,370
(Bowing)

1375
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,330
- Request a song.
- Just this once.

1376
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,270
(Just 1 song)

1377
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,600
(Thumbs up)

1378
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,130
He's slow when it comes
to picking up signals.

1379
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,810
You find him frustrating, don't you?

1380
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,210
Right.

1381
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,670
Why?

1382
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,980
- He's slow on picking up on things.
- What?

1383
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,120
That frustrates you, doesn't it?

1384
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,480
How do you think we feel right now?

1385
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,420
You must be frustrated.

1386
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,920
(She puts herself in their shoes.)

1387
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,600
- I'm starving though.
- Me too.

1388
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,060
It'll take a while.

1389
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,630
The foil being black
doesn't mean it's cooked.

1390
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,060
We should've stuck those underneath
before we started the fire.

1391
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,230
- Which ones?
- The potatoes and sweet potatoes.

1392
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,810
- When there was no fire?
- No way.

1393
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,230
- No.
- Topped with burning firewood.

1394
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,940
- She's at it again.
- She's being stubborn again.

1395
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,130
You're at this once again.

1396
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:20,250
Should we rewind the video?

1397
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,650
Does Jukjae frustrate you or not?

1398
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,150
- He does.
- Why?

1399
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,880
- He can't take a hint.
- Exactly.

1400
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,270
What about you?
Do you get what we're saying?

1401
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,480
No.

1402
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,040
(I don't get what you're saying.)

1403
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,330
(She confesses.)

1404
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:34,750
So Min, that's it.

1405
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,230
(The mirroring treatment worked.)

1406
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,130
- Give it up for BE'O!
- Yes!

1407
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,330
Thank you.

1408
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,630
That was great.
I'm loving this atmosphere.

1409
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:47,040
Who knew we'd get
to see BE'O perform?

1410
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,710
That's it, Jae Suk.
There's nothing more to do.

1411
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,440
- That's enough.
- All right.

1412
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,480
("One Man" by Kim Jong Kook,
released in 2004)

1413
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,650
Pass him the mic.

1414
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:57,940
- Here's the mic.
- Please.

1415
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,310
(Please...)

1416
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,750
- Please don't.
- Here's the mic.

1417
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,350
It's worth jelly and chips.

1418
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,420
- It
- Nice.

1419
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,230
(Has been long)

1420
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,500
You're doing good.

1421
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,690
(The original singer
starts to sing.)

1422
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,940
(A singer with a million-seller
album tries to earn jellies.)

1423
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,710
Jong Kook should release
a song like this.

1424
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,540
Release a song.

1425
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,540
Do you know this song?

1426
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,150
I've never heard of it.

1427
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,480
I've never heard of it.

1428
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,460
- You really don't know?
- He doesn't know the song.

1429
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,880
Jong Kook, I'm sorry,
but this is enough.

1430
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,350
- He doesn't know the song.
- He would know the main part.

1431
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,630
- Listen to the main part.
- If he hears the main part...

1432
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,420
- Listen to the pain part.
- Hold on.

1433
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,690
Listen to the main part.

1434
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,230
- He's a little...
- He doesn't know.

1435
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,630
- You know it, right?
- Yes.

1436
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,830
You must've heard it
in your parents' car.

1437
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:56,940
- Here it comes.
- Here.

1438
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,600
(It's coming.)

1439
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,350
- Listen to it carefully.
- Here it comes.

1440
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,940
(There's a man)

1441
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,250
Oh, "One Man."

1442
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,710
(There's a man)

1443
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,080
(Who loved you so much)

1444
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,690
- You know it.
- I know it.

1445
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,120
(BE'O knows it.)

1446
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,060
- He knows it.
- You know it, right?

1447
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,130
- I know it.
- Yes, you do.

1448
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,350
What's the matter?

1449
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,600
This is my song.

1450
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,960
- You didn't know? It's my song.
- It's your song.

1451
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,270
Did you not know? He didn't know.

1452
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,170
Hey, you're interrupting
at an important timing.

1453
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,170
- What's the matter, So Min?
- She smells like firewood.

1454
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,100
- You smell like firewood so much.
- You smell like firewood so much.

1455
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,630
- What's the matter?
- Why did you come?

1456
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,210
Can you sing 2 songs for 1 coin?

1457
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,120
- That's possible.
- That's possible.

1458
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,480
You should go down. I made a fire.

1459
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,420
- Down there?
- Sing for her down there.

1460
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,250
- This is more than enough.
- Do it for her.

1461
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,830
- He can do it.
- Jukjae, make money.

1462
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:49,290
- I'll earn a coin.
- Yes. Make money.

1463
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,630
- You were asked to perform.
- I'll get going.

1464
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,400
- See you, Jukjae.
- See you, Jukjae.

1465
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,790
- See you.
- Jukjae.

1466
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,770
- Just sing the first verse twice.
- Okay.

1467
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,460
- Don't sing three songs.
- He was asked to perform.

1468
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,940
- It's so nice.
- He was asked to perform.

1469
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,480
(Just for one star coin,
he sang outside.)

1470
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,940
How many songs did you sing?

1471
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,170
It's cold outside.

1472
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:09,750
- I know. It was cold.
- The water outside is frozen.

1473
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,210
- It's cold, isn't it?
- It's minus 7℃ or something.

1474
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,770
The bottled water is all frozen.

1475
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,250
You smell like firewood.

1476
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,650
- I think I would.
- Yes.

1477
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:16,850
You smell like barbecue.

1478
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,150
Thank you for making a fire outside.

1479
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,420
- It must've been nice for you.
- We watched a concert.

1480
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,420
It's tough outside.

1481
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,900
- Yes. That's how it is.
- These guys smell like Seoul.

1482
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,600
(The country bumpkins are surprised
by the smell of Seoul.)

1483
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,670
They smell like perfume.

1484
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:33,810
You guys smell like firewood
so much.

1485
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:34,830
We smell like fire.

1486
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:37,730
The mission is All Kinds of Songs.

1487
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:40,750
Look at the lyrics of two songs
and pick the song...

1488
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,670
that fits the theme better
through a discussion.

1489
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,150
- I like it.
- A discussion? I like it.

1490
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,480
We like discussions.

1491
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,040
- We have So Min.
- It's what she's good at.

1492
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,880
- It's nice, So Min. Show them.
- Let's do it.

1493
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,920
Thirty staff members will also vote
after hearing the discussion.

1494
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,250
Only the members who pick
the same song...

1495
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,600
chosen by the majority
will receive one point.

1496
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:05,460
The rankings will be decided
based on the total points you earn.

1497
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,600
I got it.

1498
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,440
Before revealing the 1st theme,
listen to the 2 songs.

1499
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,100
Shall we?
I like listening to music so much.

1500
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,100
Play the first song.

1501
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,100
(The first song)

1502
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,170
- It's their song. TEEN TOP.
- "No More Perfume On You..."

1503
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:20,350
by TEEN TOP.

1504
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,650
("Not More Perfume On You"
by TEEN TOP)

1505
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,380
(It's a "masterpiece people secretly
enjoy" that sings...)

1506
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,100
(about the secret of a bad guy.)

1507
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,500
I guess he's from Seoul.

1508
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,830
I love this song.

1509
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,100
But those moves are old.

1510
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,900
(The one from Seoul
whose moves are old)

1511
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,540
Is it interesting? Does it feel
like you're watching TV?

1512
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,600
- Yes.
- It's like watching TV.

1513
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,330
Does it feel
like you're watching TV?

1514
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,560
(Dancing)

1515
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,810
(Fake TEEN TOP is very excited.)

1516
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:46,940
I love this song.

1517
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,940
- What's this song about?
- Why did you choose this song?

1518
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,980
(Song A is "No More Perfume On You"
Jae Suk likes.)

1519
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,420
- It's about perfume.
- I love this song.

1520
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,850
(Song B)

1521
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:56,880
Is it the second song?

1522
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,810
Isn't it Jong Kook's song?

1523
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:02,980
(It's a song Jong Kook sang
21 years ago.)

1524
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,790
("X" by Turbo became number 1
on music shows 7 times...)

1525
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,130
(and sold a million copies.)

1526
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,230
Do it.

1527
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,370
Kook Jong.

1528
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:11,630
(The original singer is here.)

1529
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,540
There you go. You're doing good.

1530
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,600
(He can still do the steps.)

1531
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:17,980
(The swirl dance)

1532
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:18,980
There you go.

1533
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,210
(It's an actual dance.)

1534
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:23,310
There you go.

1535
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,940
You should do it.

1536
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,940
(Fancy performance by a former Turbo
member and a dance music singer)

1537
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,440
- It's "X."
- Well done, Kook Jong.

1538
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,520
(He showed what his main job was
after a long time.)

1539
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,880
The topic of the discussion related
to the lyrics of these songs...

1540
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,920
is the guy you should never date.

1541
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,980
(TEEN TOP or Turbo,
which one should you never date?)

1542
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,230
- There are a lot.
- I'll show you the lyrics.

1543
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,420
("No More Perfume On You"
by TEEN TOP)

1544
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,900
(The guy who asks a woman not to
wear perfume as he's cheating.)

1545
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,630
(Don't wear perfume,
I'll get caught by my girlfriend.)

1546
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:53,380
(Don't wear sparkly eyeshadow.
It'll get on my clothes.)

1547
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,170
(Don't say other things,
just do as I say.)

1548
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:58,540
"The guy who asks a woman not to
wear perfume as he's cheating."

1549
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,150
- Not to get caught?
- Is he cheating?

1550
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,960
- Which one is worse?
- The guy you should never date.

1551
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,250
(The guy who asks a woman not to
wear perfume as he's cheating.)

1552
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,960
- He's so bad.
- "I'll get caught by my girlfriend."

1553
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,630
- Isn't he trash?
- You can't do that.

1554
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,520
- He's trash.
- It doesn't make sense.

1555
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,000
- Is this what the song is about?
- It's like "Love and War."

1556
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,770
What is the song about, Jong Kook?

1557
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,460
- Look.
- He became the boyfriend of...

1558
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,630
- Explain.
- It's...

1559
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,670
("X" by Turbo)

1560
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,810
(The guy who is dating his crush's friend
as he isn't brave enough.)

1561
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,440
(I found my dream girl
who is like my destiny.)

1562
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,620
(But I lost the courage to approach her
because of her overconfidence.)

1563
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,310
(I tried to find a way to stay
beside her no matter what it takes.)

1564
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,880
"I tried to find a way to stay
beside her no matter what it takes."

1565
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,980
"And I chose you,
her best friend in the end."

1566
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,790
In short,

1567
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:44,060
he's dating a friend of his crush,
not his crush.

1568
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,000
He became her boyfriend
to stay with her friend.

1569
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,400
(The guy who is dating his crush's friend
as he isn't brave enough)

1570
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,920
Dating her friend isn't right.

1571
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:51,540
He's trash.

1572
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,670
He loves her friend.

1573
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,810
He's trash.

1574
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:54,960
- But...
- You sang it.

1575
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,810
- I didn't know when I sang it.
- So...

1576
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,770
You shouldn't dance on it like this.

1577
00:52:58,770 --> 00:52:59,770
I didn't know.

1578
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:01,650
- So it's like...
- Gosh.

1579
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,170
- Is he cheating?
- Between the two,

1580
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,940
- Who is worse?
- which one should you never date?

1581
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,520
I think B is worse.

1582
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,940
I think A is worse.

1583
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,420
- The last one is the worse.
- Hey.

1584
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,380
Turbo is also...

1585
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,230
- Look at the last part.
- No.

1586
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,790
Turbo is also...

1587
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,750
(Glaring)

1588
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,130
(The original singer is provoked
by the listener's comment.)

1589
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,100
- Hey.
- I wasn't talking about you.

1590
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,170
I wasn't talking about you.

1591
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,630
- Thinking about it, he's so...
- It's the lyrics.

1592
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:28,870
- If I were the girl...
- I didn't write the lyrics.

1593
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,480
- Sit down and talk. Calm down.
- Yes.

1594
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,850
- Basically, it's a discussion.
- Yes.

1595
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,750
Even if you have different opinions,
please discuss with respect.

1596
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,440
- Okay. I'll speak with respect.
- But it makes you angry.

1597
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,690
- How about you, BE'O?
- What do young people think?

1598
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,690
- I think it's B.
- You think B is worse?

1599
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,560
- He's worse? Why?
- He's worse.

1600
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,460
- Does it make sense?
- Because...

1601
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,750
- he doesn't like her, but he lied.
- Right.

1602
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,150
- It's a scam.
- Yes.

1603
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,150
- A is a scammer too.
- Yes.

1604
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,920
- But he's blatantly doing it.
- Then...

1605
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,900
Listen to his opinion until the end.

1606
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,670
BE'O is a good talker.

1607
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,210
- Hold on.
- Wait.

1608
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:05,230
His crush is his girlfriend's friend.
It will hurt both her...

1609
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:08,440
and her friend. Both will get hurt.

1610
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,900
He shouldn't get caught
until the end.

1611
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:15,250
I think A is hurting both by lying.

1612
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,060
Both the girl he's seeing...

1613
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,520
and his girlfriend.

1614
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,230
For B, as he dates her,

1615
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,900
- he might click with her.
- Yes. He might fall in love.

1616
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,500
Then it's not bad.

1617
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,230
- Only the beginning is wrong.
- Yes.

1618
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,440
Yes.

1619
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,540
- Sharing their tastes and stuff...
- Right.

1620
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,040
- They might be compatible.
- It might end...

1621
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,480
- in a good way, right?
- Yes.

1622
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,100
It didn't start
in a good way, but...

1623
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,670
Actually, A is cheating,
but B isn't cheating.

1624
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:44,380
- No, he's not.
- He's not.

1625
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,420
But B is cheating in his mind.

1626
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,520
- Look.
- No, he isn't.

1627
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,190
- Yes, he is.
- No.

1628
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,250
(No, he isn't.)

1629
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,650
(Yes, he is.)

1630
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:53,960
They're breaking up.

1631
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,750
- Listen.
- I... Why should I listen?

1632
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,600
He might end up liking her.

1633
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,400
- They're arguing.
- But Jong Kook.

1634
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,730
It's the first time
after a long while.

1635
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,270
Isn't it good in the end?

1636
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,830
- Look.
- No, it isn't.

1637
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:07,900
- Just once.
- It is, in the end.

1638
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,600
They know each other here.

1639
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:12,900
- Right.
- They're close.

1640
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,000
Are you giving us a lecture?

1641
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,310
- He's between best friends.
- Yes.

1642
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:20,290
A guy called Turbo
is getting between them.

1643
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,880
- Do you know what's more annoying?
- He's coming between them,

1644
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,920
not getting between them.

1645
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,750
In "Love Is," his friend...

1646
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,960
- Haha.
- took his girlfriend away from him.

1647
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,790
- Then here, he suddenly...
- Haha.

1648
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,830
- I'm sorry, but...
- It infuriates me.

1649
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,560
Don't say
something unrelated to this.

1650
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,130
- But A is...
- Don't talk about "Love Is."

1651
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,920
- He shouldn't do that.
- She doesn't know.

1652
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,960
He's just like a boy playing around
in a nightclub.

1653
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,400
- No.
- No.

1654
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,810
- He's the bad guy.
- Why?

1655
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,900
I also think he's the bad one.

1656
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,400
- Hey.
- TEEN TOP... Listen to me.

1657
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,580
- He planned everything.
- Yes.

1658
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,210
He's a really secretive guy.

1659
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:53,650
- You should never date him.
- He's worse.

1660
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,650
- He's worse.
- Don't curse.

1661
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,060
- He makes me curse!
- You should curse at him!

1662
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,060
- Curse after this is over.
- How can I not curse?

1663
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,330
- He planned everything.
- You sang this song!

1664
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,150
- They're arguing.
- They're arguing.

1665
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:07,230
- Jae Suk.
- You sang it.

1666
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,830
- Okay.
- Why are you doing this?

1667
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:13,000
- Yes.
- But B is at least...

1668
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,370
How should I put it? He's romantic.

1669
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,630
- Because he...
- He's romantic.

1670
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,980
He chose her friend as he
couldn't tell her his feelings.

1671
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,710
That's what I'm talking about.

1672
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,540
- B is cheating on his girlfriend.
- He's cheating.

1673
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,210
- So he's worse.
- Look.

1674
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:26,210
Yes. Say it.

1675
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:29,080
Dating this girl, A's relationship
with his girlfriend is over.

1676
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,380
I mean their love is broken.

1677
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,710
- No.
- He's keeping it as a secret.

1678
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:34,420
But for B, he'll ruin both his
relationship and their friendship.

1679
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,130
- It's a disaster.
- Right.

1680
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,850
- No.
- His relationship won't break.

1681
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:39,850
- It will.
- If he falls in love...

1682
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:40,870
with his girlfriend,
his relationship will not be ruined.

1683
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,270
- It will ruin it.
- He can save one of them.

1684
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:43,830
Right. Look.

1685
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:46,600
I think A is worse
because of the lyrics here.

1686
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,600
- "Don't wear perfume,"
- Yes.

1687
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,600
- "I'll get caught by my girlfriend."
- Exactly.

1688
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,600
Right.

1689
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,880
Look at the lyrics at the end.
"Just do as I say." That's gaslighting.

1690
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,600
- That's LPG-lighting.
- What do you mean it's gaslighting?

1691
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,650
He was LPG-lighting her.

1692
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:59,270
- Look. So...
- Listen.

1693
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:01,290
- Listen to me.
- It says "I found my dream girl."

1694
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:02,310
Listen.

1695
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,020
"Don't wear perfume."

1696
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,650
This means this lady...

1697
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,350
- also knows he has a girlfriend.
- She knows.

1698
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:10,600
That's why it's more wrong.

1699
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,750
That's why he's telling her
not to do those things.

1700
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,100
Don't do this, don't do that.

1701
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,100
- Sit down.
- That's right.

1702
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,100
Sit down.

1703
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,560
I can't sit down. I'm so annoyed.

1704
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,830
- There's someone like that?
- Let's come to A.

1705
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,170
- No, I...
- Actually,

1706
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,000
there's some romantic vibe
in the old song.

1707
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,710
- It has that feel.
- It does.

1708
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,480
- The old-times vibe. It's cool.
- Yes.

1709
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,580
- "Yes I love you, but..."
- I know.

1710
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,710
- "But I love you."
- It's romantic.

1711
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,850
But this jerk is...

1712
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:38,520
(He punishes him himself.)

1713
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,810
- Does it make sense?
- Look.

1714
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:41,730
Let me say just one thing.

1715
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:45,000
Jong Kook...

1716
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,790
- explained this well.
- Yes.

1717
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:49,060
- In the old times, this works.
- Yes. It's romantic.

1718
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,060
In the 90s, this makes no sense.

1719
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,460
- It makes no sense even now.
- It doesn't.

1720
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,710
But now, this makes less sense.

1721
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:56,810
No. This works.

1722
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,630
He's not honest.

1723
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,540
- Then who am I?
- That's right.

1724
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,380
- It was all for the friend.
- That's right.

1725
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,670
- My life is in ruins.
- Yes.

1726
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,540
(Staring)

1727
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,980
- My life is in ruins.
- Jae Suk.

1728
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,690
- Hold on. Wait.
- They're fighting.

1729
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,980
You keep putting yourself
in the shoes of the deceived girl.

1730
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:13,980
Wait. Hey.

1731
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,420
You keep putting yourself
in the shoes of the deceived girl.

1732
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,250
Wait. Hey.

1733
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,350
He said "hey."

1734
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,690
- Hey, you.
- They're breaking up.

1735
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,670
- Fight.
- Fight.

1736
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,060
- No.
- It's romantic.

1737
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,170
- Romance.
- Jong Kook.

1738
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,330
- Hold on.
- What's romantic?

1739
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,980
- So Min.
- Listen up.

1740
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,480
You seem very angry.

1741
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,080
Tell us what you think, So Min.

1742
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,380
- So Min is angry.
- Tell us.

1743
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,440
- She's angry.
- So Min is annoyed.

1744
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,810
- She'll tell us the answer.
- I only focus on the present.

1745
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,850
Just the present.
I don't look at the future or past.

1746
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,540
- In this situation,
- Yes.

1747
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:47,350
I'm already in the shoes
of the girl he's with now.

1748
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,250
So like you said,

1749
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,250
- "What am I? Am I a replacement?"
- "What am I?"

1750
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,000
- Here you have two bad people.
- Yes.

1751
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,870
- Here you have one innocent person.
- That's right.

1752
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,100
- This is worse.
- Precisely.

1753
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,960
- That's right.
- There's a victim.

1754
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,690
- Hey.
- That's worse.

1755
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,770
Why is there no innocent person
here?

1756
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,210
- How nice is this girlfriend?
- That's right.

1757
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,630
But they're cheating.

1758
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:08,080
- The girlfriend is a nice person.
- How nice is this girlfriend?

1759
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,710
(The focus shifted
to finding the nice person.)

1760
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,350
- Here...
- Wait.

1761
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,150
- The girlfriend is the victim.
- The girlfriend is the victim.

1762
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,920
When you look at it
from a third-person perspective...

1763
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,520
- No.
- This is worse.

1764
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,210
There is a victim here.

1765
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:22,250
There is, but...

1766
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,320
- There is a victim here.
- Excuse me, you have to debate...

1767
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,070
- Wait.
- Debate.

1768
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:39,040
- What?
- It's a debate.

1769
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,130
Who are you?

1770
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:41,940
Please have a discussion.
Don't fight.

1771
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,210
- Who are you?
- This made us annoyed.

1772
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,540
- That's right.
- Hey.

1773
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,540
First, get to your seats.

1774
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,440
- Change the seats.
- Think about it.

1775
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,210
- Wait.
- Sit in the seats A or B.

1776
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,920
I choose B. Isn't it obvious?

1777
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,920
Go over that side, As.

1778
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,210
- A.
- Go that side.

1779
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:56,920
- A is worse.
- Yes.

1780
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,710
- A is bad.
- Yes. A is bad.

1781
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,110
- B.
- No, B is...

1782
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,190
Why is B bad?

1783
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:02,650
- Also...
- B is...

1784
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:03,820
Wait. In the lyrics...

1785
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,400
What we should remember is...

1786
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,320
they are both bad. Both of them.

1787
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,070
- They are both bad.
- But who is worse?

1788
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,630
- That's the question.
- That's B.

1789
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:13,070
- It's A.
- It's A!

1790
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,130
A is worse.

1791
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:17,130
- B!
- He's talking, you know.

1792
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,610
Isn't he talking?

1793
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:19,840
Jae Suk was talking first.

1794
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,840
How old is he?

1795
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,400
- First, sit down.
- You can...

1796
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,980
What? "How old is he?"

1797
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:26,210
- I'm here.
- "How old is he?"

1798
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,210
- You're talking about age?
- Age?

1799
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,380
Sit down.

1800
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,590
- Look.
- What?

59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,230
There is one bad person here.

1801
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,320
But there, there are two.

1802
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,920
- No.
- There...

1803
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,960
There is no bad person in B.

1804
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,070
- That's right.
- Right?

1805
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,590
Because in B, this one man...

1806
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,040
- He ruined everything.
- hurts the girl he doesn't like...

1807
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,940
- and her friend...
- He didn't hurt her yet.

1808
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:48,940
- That's right.
- He hurt her.

1809
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,210
- They didn't start yet.
- He didn't hurt her.

1810
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:53,210
His true heart is in here!

1811
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:55,250
Not yet...

1812
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:56,840
It's in here.

1813
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,210
- Hold on.
- Come back.

1814
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,210
- First,
- Yes.

1815
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:03,550
it's not something that you see
these days.

1816
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,920
- I know.
- This used to happen before.

1817
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,790
- It used to be covered as sad love.
- Yes.

1818
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,820
But like I said before,

1819
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:14,670
for his current girlfriend,

1820
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:16,070
this is a disaster.

1821
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,940
Exactly. I feel bad for that girl.

1822
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,670
Have you put yourself in her shoes?

1823
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:23,070
What's more important is that
Kim Jong Kook, who sang this song,

1824
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:26,230
danced to this song
without knowing what it was about.

1825
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,500
Think about
how the girlfriend would feel.

1826
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,750
They're fighting.

1827
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,820
(Oh, my love, goodbye)

1828
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,840
This...

1829
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,210
This is more shocking for me.

1830
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:42,730
It's a disaster for the girlfriend.

1831
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,860
- I'm sorry, but...
- Isn't this too harsh?

1832
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,130
I danced to it because...

1833
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,230
You danced to it like this.

1834
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,570
I danced to it
because I was in a dance group.

1835
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:55,130
And that was a concept.

1836
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:56,840
Dancing to a sad song.

1837
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,340
- Is that right?
- Right.

1838
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,300
- It's romantic.
- How is it romantic?

1839
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,150
Why is that romantic?

1840
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:03,170
- Romantic?
- It's like...

1841
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,210
I'm holding your hand,

1842
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:08,610
and at the same time
looking at Suk Jin with love.

1843
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,380
- At Suk Jin?
- Yes. Is that all right with you?

1844
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:13,090
But I'll send you to him
if you really love him.

1845
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:14,730
But I wouldn't tell you.

1846
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,820
Because I can't see Suk Jin
if it isn't with you.

1847
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,020
But I think I'll let you go...

1848
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,570
- if you really liked Suk Jin.
- But I'm hiding that feeling.

1849
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,320
Look. There's you and Ji Hyo,

1850
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,770
and I'm close to her.
Can't love her?

1851
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,860
You can't.

1852
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,570
That's not what's going on here.

1853
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,940
- You like me.
- Come here, So Min and Se Chan.

1854
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,040
I don't understand him.

1855
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,250
He's not your boyfriend. Why...

1856
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,420
She keeps saying she's with me
but she'll love Suk Jin.

1857
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,570
- She keeps saying that.
- So MIn.

1858
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:41,750
I kept asking her
why she couldn't meet Suk Jin.

1859
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,480
- Why would you...
- Why are you saying that to him?

1860
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,320
- Are you his girlfriend?
- She says we're together,

1861
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,960
but she wants to meet Suk Jin.
So I said you can't do that.

1862
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,920
- It drives me crazy.
- Do you know what he said?

1863
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,820
He said he'll let me go to Suk Jin
if I really love him.

1864
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,190
He said that.

1865
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,400
He'll let me go.

1866
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,690
If you like him, I'll let you go.

1867
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,230
- Love him as you may.
- Yes. She should love him.

1868
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,300
First...

1869
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,230
What I think is important...

1870
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:09,480
is that in this song,
they know what they're doing is wrong,

1871
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,480
They know.

1872
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,380
- but they still do it.
- That's right.

1873
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,690
But here,
what he's doing isn't wrong.

1874
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,750
- Yes. He didn't do anything wrong.
- Yes, he didn't.

1875
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,210
There's nothing wrong here,

1876
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,920
but here, both sides
are doing something wrong.

1877
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,380
No way.

1878
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,550
If Jukjae wrote the lyrics
of this song,

1879
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,190
it would have sounded beautiful.

1880
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:30,820
He would have said,
"Would you please put on perfume?"

1881
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:33,770
- "My girlfriend will find out."
- "My girlfriend will find out."

1882
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:36,440
- "Could you use less glitter?"
- It's a light song.

1883
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,800
"Please don't argue with me."

1884
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,210
It's just that TEEN TOP
sang it with a strong tone.

1885
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:41,610
That's not true.

1886
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:44,380
Could you come with me
to put on perfume?

1887
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:46,380
TEEN TOP...

1888
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,650
is an idol group.

1889
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:52,110
That's fooling you.
They also look handsome.

1890
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:54,110
Imagine I'm the guy here.

1891
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:56,320
"I feel like I've become a man
when I'm with you."

1892
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,020
- What?
- Did you write this?

1893
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:01,400
(He sounds suspicious.)

1894
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,590
How old is this lady?

1895
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,960
She should be
more than 60 years old.

1896
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,000
Is she still alive?

1897
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:12,300
Let me tell you. If she's older,
her son would be in the military.

1898
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,300
Look.

1899
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,800
(A lady older than Suk Jin
was summoned for the discussion.)

1900
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,900
Look.

1901
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,070
- The part that makes me annoyed...
- Yes.

1902
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,320
"Don't put on perfume,
my wife will find out."

1903
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,380
- To your wife.
- That's right.

1904
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,920
- That's crazy.
- It's horrible.

1905
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,550
It's different when you're dating.

1906
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:28,750
- Having no courage to confess.
- Yes.

1907
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,130
- How sad is that?
- It's sad.

1908
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:32,320
He dates the friend of the person
he loves to stay next to her.

1909
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,420
- The same goes here.
- Here, he's cheating!

1910
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,520
He doesn't get caught
that he's cheating.

1911
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,860
He tells the girl
to not wear perfume.

1912
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:41,230
- How bad is that?
- Hey.

1913
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:42,670
- He's cheating.
- That's bad.

1914
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,630
How dare you argue with him?

1915
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,670
Stay quiet.

1916
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:49,800
- He hit me.
- What did you do?

1917
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,270
Why are you hitting him?

1918
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:52,940
- What are you doing?
- Why did you hit him?

1919
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,520
(Chaos)

1920
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,210
(There's no dignity or class here.)

1921
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,020
Stop.

1922
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,420
You want more?

1923
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,230
You understand that?

1924
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,590
What are you doing?

1925
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:06,630
- You understand that?
- Look at that.

1926
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:09,630
How bad is that?
He doesn't get caught cheating.

1927
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:11,170
How sad is it for the girl
he's dating?

1928
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:13,300
- What did she do wrong?
- She'll love this man.

1929
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,340
The controversy is...

1930
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,210
- I know. That's what I'm saying.
- Look.

1931
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,980
Hey! Look at yourself!

1932
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,070
You look at yourself!

1933
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,110
You sang that song.

1934
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,250
It's because of you.

1935
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,380
You also sang "Love is."

1936
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,570
- I sang it, but...
- Come back, Haha.

1937
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:30,210
- Come here.
- I got so angry.

1938
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:31,290
I got carried away.

1939
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:33,920
Let's all sit down.

1940
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,130
- Okay.
- Let's sit down.

1941
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,520
This got heated.

1942
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,860
- Cheating is...
- The staff are deciding, right?

1943
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,820
Yes. First,

1944
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,570
the members can hold up the panel...

1945
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,800
of the song you think
has the worse man.

1946
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,440
All right. One, two, three.

1947
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,230
- A.
- We all think it's A.

1948
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:54,770
Jae Suk also is holding A.

1949
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:55,840
It was a mistake.

1950
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,380
- It shouldn't be facing you.
- That's right.

1951
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,110
Four of you chose B
and five of you chose A.

1952
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:02,820
The staff can also choose...

1953
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:05,460
- the song with the worse man.
- Okay.

1954
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:07,710
- One, two, three.
- It's so annoying.

1955
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,520
- More people chose B.
- B.

1956
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,360
- A lot of people chose B.
- A.

1957
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,130
- A lot of people chose B.
- A lot of people chose A.

1958
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,460
- More people chose A.
- It's A.

1959
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,400
- More people chose A.
- As for the staff members...

1960
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,590
- A.
- Thirteen people chose B.

1961
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:20,070
- "No More Perfume on You."
- That's right.

1962
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,860
- Justice is alive.
- The society with common sense.

1963
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,460
- Cheating...
- The society with common sense.

1964
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:25,130
- It makes no sense.
- It makes no sense.

1965
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:26,610
- Three.
- It makes no sense.

1966
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:27,770
How is this even possible?

1967
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:30,250
The three of you who were chosen
by the majority and...

1968
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,670
- Ji Hyo chose A.
- I got it right.

1969
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,670
Each one of you received
a point each.

1970
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,610
- So 3, 1, and 1 point respectively.
- Okay.

1971
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,710
- It makes no sense.
- Let's sit down.

1972
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:40,920
- That was funny.
- The second theme will be revealed.

1973
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,690
- This game is fun.
- Let's listen to the songs first.

1974
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:44,020
Jong Kook,

1975
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,360
sing this song with care
at the concert.

1976
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:48,000
- I should do that.
- It's "Meant to Be."

1977
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,570
("Meant to Be" by Solid)

1978
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:55,210
("Meant to Be" is a dance song...)

1979
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:58,610
(from Solid's 3rd album...)

1980
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:01,940
(that became more popular
than the title song.)

1981
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:06,110
- It's just this once
- It's just this once

1982
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:07,710
- Don't you know this song?
- I don't know it.

1983
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:09,290
(The man who was born in 2000
doesn't know a song from 1996.)

1984
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:11,050
- I left the house with excitement
- I left the house with excitement

1985
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:12,860
- The weather is nice, I feel great
- The weather is nice, I feel great

1986
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,820
- In any case, things were nice
- In any case, things were nice

1987
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,250
BE'O hasn't heard this song before.

1988
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,750
- Really?
- It's understandable. He is young.

1989
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:19,960
It's my first time hearing it.

1990
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,360
(Then comes Song B.)

1991
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,670
I like this song.

1992
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,270
It's a song by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1993
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:27,590
("Love Only Allowed by Heaven"
by Uhm Jung Hwa)

1994
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,940
"Love Only Allowed by Heaven."

1995
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:30,960
("Love Only Allowed by Heaven"
is a ballad song...)

1996
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,000
(that represents Uhm Jung Hwa
and sold 100,000 copies.)

1997
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,070
- It's a nice song.
- It's a song by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1998
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,770
(The sentimental frog
gets into the mood.)

1999
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,980
(What kind of stories
do these two songs have?)

2000
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,150
It's a nice song.

2001
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:44,480
But the lyrics...

2002
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,820
The lyrics were a bit off.

2003
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,480
Here comes the second question.

2004
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,250
Which couple would last longer?

2005
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,650
- Which couple would last longer?
- Which couple would last longer?

2006
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:55,020
- A long-lasting couple.
- It will be easy.

2007
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,190
- Yes.
- A long-lasting couple.

2008
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:58,540
Unlike the first question,
this isn't about who is worse.

2009
01:07:58,540 --> 01:07:59,590
Which couple would last longer?

2010
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:01,840
- Which couple would last longer?
- Yes.

2011
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,110
- Explain the lyrics.
- In this song,

2012
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,300
he swore that it was just this once
and attended a blind date.

2013
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,710
He turned down the offer many times,

2014
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,400
- but his friend insisted.
- So he attended a blind date.

2015
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,520
When he got there,

2016
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,520
- his girlfriend was there.
- Yes.

2017
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,420
- His girlfriend lied too.
- That's right.

2018
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,590
- They lied to each other.
- It was a blind date.

2019
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:21,190
- Yes. But his girlfriend was there.
- That's the absolute worst.

2020
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:23,550
They couldn't help but laugh and say
that they were meant to be.

2021
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:25,800
- This makes no sense.
- Hold on.

2022
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,690
- My goodness.
- That's the plot.

2023
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:28,820
There was a twist.

2024
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:31,170
They laughed and said
that they were meant to be.

2025
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:32,630
This makes no sense.

2026
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,340
- Hold on.
- My goodness.

2027
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,340
That's the plot.

2028
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,630
In the end, they met.

2029
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:39,800
Thus, he changed his attitude
rather quickly.

2030
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,940
It's funny.

2031
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:42,980
This couple is cool.

2032
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,380
They just laughed...

2033
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:45,710
- after seeing each other.
- Yes.

2034
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:46,750
They burst out laughing.

2035
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,110
Couple A would last long.

2036
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:49,380
- That's the plot.
- That's right.

2037
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,640
- Couple B wouldn't last long.
- Let's now study...

2038
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,110
- this song.
- Once a cheater, always a cheater.

2039
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:54,290
This woman lost a friend
after she stole her boyfriend,

2040
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:56,290
but the sky allowed
this fateful love.

2041
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:57,520
Why did the sky allow it?

2042
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,690
You know,

2043
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:00,600
- it's her justification.
- It's her excuse.

2044
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,000
- It's her excuse.
- It's her justification.

2045
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,860
How did she steal
her friend's boyfriend? How?

2046
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:07,360
- She stole him. For example...
- Such a thing happens often.

2047
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:09,840
Let's say Suk Jin and I were
a couple.

2048
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,140
You stole me.

2049
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,710
- I see.
- You get it now, right?

2050
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,850
Judging from the cases
I have witnessed so far,

2051
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:19,270
a relationship with a friend's lover
doesn't last long.

2052
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:21,920
- It's true, but look at Couple B.
- They break up soon.

2053
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,310
Both of them are cheaters.

2054
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:25,220
- Hold on.
- Both of them are cheaters.

2055
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:26,760
Here is the thing about Couple A.

2056
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:28,320
- They laughed now, right?
- Yes.

2057
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,430
They will think about it
on their way home.

2058
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:32,220
- No.
- I am serious.

2059
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,850
- Every time they fight.
- On their way home...

2060
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,820
- "Hold on."
- "I can't believe it."

2061
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,820
- "She agreed to a blind date."
- "She agreed to a blind date."

2062
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,540
- "I guess she wants to cheat."
- That's right.

2063
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,230
- The cheating spirit.
- It will come up during a fight.

2064
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:43,430
- Yes.
- It will come up...

2065
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,880
- every time they fight.
- That's right.

2066
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,880
It will come up
even after they get married...

2067
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,880
and have a child.

2068
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,850
"What were you thinking back then?"

2069
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,070
"You were there too."
They will fight like that.

2070
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:52,610
I think Couple A would last long.

2071
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:53,720
They would last long.

2072
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,790
- Couple B has it hard.
- But...

2073
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,550
- you know...
- They have it hard.

2074
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:57,550
- They have it hard.
- They wouldn't last.

2075
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:58,560
Couple A would last long...

2076
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,560
- despite the fights.
- I know.

2077
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,060
- Right? They would last long.
- They would last long.

2078
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,890
Let's take turns...

2079
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:06,650
and share our opinions
for 30 seconds each.

2080
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,630
This is what I think.

2081
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:11,860
- Which couple would last long?
- The couple that would last long...

2082
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:15,100
is this one because they share
something in common.

2083
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,470
They betrayed the same person...

2084
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:18,730
- for their love.
- So they will protect their love.

2085
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:21,770
Because of guilt, they will maintain
a good relationship.

2086
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:24,050
They will last longer than Couple A.

2087
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:25,810
To endure the criticism,

2088
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:27,420
they must prove their love.

2089
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,310
I also think it's B.

2090
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:33,290
The couple in Song A
won't be able to trust each other.

2091
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:35,850
- There could be another blind date.
- That's right.

2092
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,650
It's unbelievable that they laughed.

2093
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,820
My goodness.

2094
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:42,190
- They have good personalities.
- They were taken aback.

2095
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:44,190
BE'O,
you are very different from me.

2096
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:45,800
- They have good personalities.
- When you get married,

2097
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,300
having a good personality
is crucial.

2098
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:49,730
You put the past behind you.

2099
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,230
- Suk Jin.
- That's how it is.

2100
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:54,570
He is too young
to think about marriage.

2101
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:55,940
- He is young.
- Listen.

2102
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:57,400
- Calm down.
- It's true.

2103
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:59,310
It's true.

2104
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:00,750
What Suk Jin said is true.

2105
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:03,290
I don't think
neither couple would last long.

2106
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,610
If the woman in Song B finds
another man,

2107
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:07,310
she will think
it's love only allowed by the sky.

2108
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,090
- Yes.
- She will fall for him.

2109
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,930
- That's a good point.
- She is bound to cheat again.

2110
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:12,260
- I have the same thought.
- She is bound...

2111
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:14,460
to blame it on the sky
until the end.

2112
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,760
This couple is annoying.

2113
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,820
They are annoying indeed.

2114
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,340
- It makes no sense.
- They justify their love.

2115
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,860
Their love can't be blessed.

2116
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,260
- Seriously.
- There is a victim too.

2117
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,570
But I had this thought.
Had Turbo sung this song,

2118
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:27,040
they would have danced.

2119
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:29,880
- We...
- It's a ballad song.

2120
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,470
- We would have danced.
- It's a ballad song.

2121
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:33,380
- We...
- Turbo was a dance group.

2122
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:35,550
- Of course.
- They would have danced.

2123
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:36,850
We danced to ballad songs.

2124
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,310
We danced to "A Jazz Bar" too.

2125
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:41,790
- That's right.
- Yes.

2126
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:47,430
(Turbo can dance to ballad songs.)

2127
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,100
Here is what I think.
Let's say I want to get married...

2128
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,060
in that situation.

2129
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:56,140
In Song B's situation,
I wouldn't be able to get married.

2130
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:58,270
- I won't be able to invite anyone.
- Seriously.

2131
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,430
It would be disastrous.

2132
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,570
- But in Song A's situation,
- It would be funny.

2133
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:03,270
the wedding will be funny.

2134
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:04,770
"Se Chan, I knew that would happen."

2135
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:05,770
"I knew you would get caught."

2136
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:08,790
- The atmosphere will be merry.
- A wedding between comedians.

2137
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:10,220
- It would be like a comedy skit.
- You can even talk about it...

2138
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,310
while hosting the wedding.

2139
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,680
- Of course.
- That's right.

2140
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,890
- A friend would talk about it.
- That's right.

2141
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:16,980
- "They met on a blind date."
- That's right.

2142
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,760
"In the end, they got married.
Please give them a big hand."

2143
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,100
- Then people will cheer.
- As for Song B,

2144
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,130
how will the wedding go?

2145
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:24,170
"Their love was only allowed
by the sky."

2146
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,390
- Listen.
- There will only be three guests.

2147
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:28,060
- "Please..."
- There will only be three guests.

2148
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:29,930
- "Please look at the sky."
- There will be so much food left.

2149
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:31,840
- They are bound to break up.
- If you think about marriage,

2150
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,810
- Couple A is better...
- That's right.

2151
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:35,750
- because they can invite people.
- That's right.

2152
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:39,010
- We reached a conclusion.
- Yes.

2153
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:41,350
- No one will choose B.
- No one will choose B.

2154
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:44,010
Please raise your answer
on the count of three.

2155
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:45,610
Which couple would last longer?

2156
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:46,960
- One, two, three.
- A.

2157
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,460
- I chose A.
- All As.

2158
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:51,890
Since everyone chose A,
we will move on to the next one.

2159
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:54,390
- Everyone won a point.
- That's good.

2160
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:57,600
- It's a competition.
- Please play the next songs.

2161
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,170
There should be two bad guys.

2162
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:00,760
What?

2163
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,810
("Let's Go See the Stars" by Jukjae)

2164
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:04,640
What are you up to?

2165
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,840
It's a song by Jukjae.

2166
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:11,440
- Let's go see the stars
- Let's go see the stars

2167
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,720
This is nice.

2168
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,720
("Let's Go See the Stars" is based
on Jukjae's actual experience.)

2169
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:18,510
(Discord)

2170
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,680
So Min, why are your eyes teary?

2171
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:23,720
(It's nice.)

2172
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,220
(She is cute.)

2173
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:27,220
Hold on. "Put on a light jacket?"

2174
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:28,320
(Getting ready for a debate)

2175
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,020
"Put on a light jacket?"

2176
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,130
Here comes the next song.

2177
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:32,670
(The second song gets revealed.)

2178
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:35,540
It's a song by Kim Dong Ryul.
"A Drunken Confession."

2179
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:39,470
- I loved you from the start
- I loved you from the start

2180
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:40,730
I sang this song often.

2181
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:42,140
I really like this song.

2182
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:44,250
("A Drunken Confession" is a song
from Exhibition's 2nd album...)

2183
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,770
(that was recorded
when the members were drunk.)

2184
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:51,420
(It's a song men love to sing
at the karaoke.)

2185
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,420
It's a song by Kim Dong Ryul.
That man...

2186
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,150
Here is the question.

2187
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,800
When you hear a confession of love,
which situation is more exciting?

2188
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,000
The answer would be...

2189
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,190
A, right?

2190
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,470
B, of course.

2191
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:04,860
It's A. Don't be ridiculous. It's A.

2192
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,260
(The guy who asks you
to come out at night...)

2193
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:11,060
(so that you can go and see
the stars with him.)

2194
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,900
A is a song by Jukjae.

2195
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,310
This man asks you
to go and see the stars with him.

2196
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:19,070
(The guy who confesses
to the woman he loves...)

2197
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:21,940
(in a drunken state)

2198
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:25,310
It has the sentimentality
of the era, right?

2199
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,790
- It's A.
- It's A.

2200
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,290
- It's A.
- It's definitely A.

2201
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,590
It's better to ask someone out
like that.

2202
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:32,500
I hate it when a man confesses
in a drunken state.

2203
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,060
- Really?
- It sounds like a lie.

2204
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,500
What if he isn't that drunk?

2205
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:38,220
- You sound quite drunk.
- He is only a bit drunk.

2206
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:40,500
- Your face looks drunk.
- "Your face looks drunk?"

2207
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,560
So Min,

2208
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,100
when you consider
the situations in the two songs,

2209
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,900
doesn't the person matter more?

2210
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,400
- No.
- The person who is confessing.

2211
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:50,750
- Let's say Jinyoung of GOT7...
- The person matters more.

2212
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:51,920
confesses to you in a drunken state.

2213
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,180
Jinyoung of GOT7 is the man
in "A Drunken Confession..."

2214
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:56,640
and Se Chan is the man
in "Let's Go See the Stars."

2215
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,460
(Let's go see the stars.)

2216
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:00,420
- That's right.
- The person matters more.

2217
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,130
(The balance is ruined.)

2218
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,060
This man loved you from the start.

2219
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:06,100
Why didn't he tell me sooner?

2220
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,890
Seriously.

2221
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,300
The person matters more.

2222
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:11,600
- Let's say it's the same person.
- Okay.

2223
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,430
- The same person.
- It's the same person.

2224
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,430
"Let's go see the stars."

2225
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:16,810
He does sound like a womanizer.

2226
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:17,900
It sounds playful.

2227
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,070
- He sounds like a player.
- To be honest,

2228
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:21,100
I agree with Haha.

2229
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,750
This man seems too experienced.

2230
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:24,900
He must have done this many times.

2231
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,570
"Put on a light jacket."

2232
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:28,480
- He went to this place many times.
- No.

2233
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,220
- No.
- He chose the day...

2234
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:33,980
with the perfect weather,
so a light jacket is enough.

2235
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,980
- He planned it all out.
- He mentioned a light jacket...

2236
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,020
- because he has a car.
- No.

2237
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:39,300
- No. He wants to walk.
- Think about sincerity.

2238
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,820
- Think about sincerity.
- He is a womanizer.

2239
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,360
- The old song has sincerity.
- I agree.

2240
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,390
The love he suppressed
poured out in a drunken state.

2241
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,300
It's quite pure.

2242
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:50,670
"Let me make a confession now.
I loved you from the start."

2243
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:52,400
- Listen.
- He has loved her for a while.

2244
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,900
He has loved her for a while.

2245
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,180
- It's true love.
- Yes. It's true love.

2246
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,880
- As for that situation...
- How about this man?

2247
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,970
- He likes her too.
- As for that situation...

2248
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,390
I am sorry,
but he is simply seducing her.

2249
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:04,590
- Don't say that.
- He is simply seducing her.

2250
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:05,590
He is simply seducing her.

2251
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,960
As for him,
he has loved her for a long while.

2252
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,790
I would recommend the man in Song B
to my younger sister.

2253
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:11,800
That's right.

2254
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,820
- That's right.
- As for me.

2255
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:13,820
- I would recommend him.
- Him?

2256
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:15,500
Hey, he is a player!

2257
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,470
- What?
- He has done this countless times.

2258
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:19,140
- He isn't a player.
- A player?

2259
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,970
- The man in Song B is the same.
- Is he a player?

2260
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:22,710
- Jae Suk.
- Is he a player?

2261
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:24,230
- Didn't you write the lyrics?
- He is a player.

2262
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:26,470
- The man in Song B is the same.
- He sounds like a delinquent.

2263
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:28,010
- Listen.
- Seriously.

2264
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:30,470
- It's Jukjae's story.
- Let's hear from Jukjae.

2265
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,970
- That's right.
- Didn't you write the lyrics?

2266
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:33,070
Yes, I did.

2267
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:34,420
Which situation
makes your heart flutter more?

2268
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:37,750
"Let's Go See the Stars," of course.

2269
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:39,590
I wrote it with a pure heart.

2270
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:41,220
- It doesn't seem pure.
- Is it based on your experience?

2271
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:43,290
I enjoyed stargazing.

2272
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:45,220
- Is it based on your experience?
- Yes. I did it often.

2273
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:46,520
How could you call that pure?

2274
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,300
Had the lyrics been "Put on a gown,"

2275
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,060
- it wouldn't have been pure.
- Of course not.

2276
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,800
- "Put on a light jacket."
- That isn't very pure. Look.

2277
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:56,040
- "There is a lot I want to say,"
- A light jacket.

2278
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,360
"but I won't rush things."

2279
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,540
- That's right.
- "But I will hold your hand tight."

2280
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,470
He is already thinking
about making physical contact.

2281
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:02,880
Isn't it too much?

2282
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,770
- Is it so hard to hold hands?
- Of course.

2283
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:06,420
You can't hold hands
with someone you aren't dating.

2284
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,270
Nothing has happened.

2285
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,850
You can get permission.
You can excuse yourself...

2286
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:11,310
- before holding her hand.
- That works.

2287
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:12,850
You can ask, "Can I hold your hand?"

2288
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:16,350
- I think Song A is...
- He just made a suggestion.

2289
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:18,430
- He just made a suggestion.
- If she bites, it's good.

2290
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:22,100
- It's like fishing.
- No.

2291
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,800
- It isn't like fishing.
- Be quiet.

2292
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,340
- Listen.
- It isn't like fishing.

2293
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,140
I bet he cast many lines too.

2294
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:28,710
He is the singer.

2295
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,860
- I am sorry.
- He is the singer.

2296
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,680
- I am sorry.
- Ignore what we say.

2297
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,350
Jukjae, I bet you didn't foresee
this kind of interpretation.

2298
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:36,970
(They missed
the songwriter's intention.)

2299
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:38,550
- I am sorry.
- I bet you didn't foresee it.

2300
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:40,750
- It's just my interpretation.
- People have different views.

2301
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,220
BE'O, what do you think?

2302
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,480
I think the man
in "A Drunken Confession" is...

2303
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,180
- He is sincere, right?
- He seems like a loser.

2304
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:47,180
- That's right.
- That's right.

2305
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:48,960
- I say that...
- He is still charming.

2306
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,850
because he lacked courage
and had to rely on alcohol.

2307
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:53,650
- That's right.
- That's how much he loves her.

2308
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:56,000
- He should pluck up the courage.
- No.

2309
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,060
- The man in Song A is a player.
- He is a player.

2310
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:00,430
- The man in Song B isn't a loser.
- He is a player.

2311
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,010
- A player?
- He is a player.

2312
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,670
The man in Song B could be
a player too.

2313
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:05,930
- No. He only confessed once.
- He got drunk and...

2314
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:07,600
- The man in Song A...
- Listen.

2315
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,510
- must have confessed many times.
- Listen.

2316
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,250
Maybe he confesses love
whenever he is drunk.

2317
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:15,350
If he gets rejected, he will say,
"I said it because I was drunk."

2318
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:17,550
- He says it himself.
- He lacks courage.

2319
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:20,510
"This might be a mistake.
I might forget all in the morning."

2320
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:22,930
- He might forget what he said.
- Yes.

2321
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:23,960
BE'O.

2322
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,150
You said he will say,
"I said it because I was drunk."

2323
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:28,560
The man in Song A will say,
"I never said I liked you."

2324
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,000
"I simply asked you
to go and see the stars with me."

2325
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:33,190
See? He is a player.

2326
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,640
(Those who think the man in Song A
is a player cheer.)

2327
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,900
Suk Jin, you are doing great.

2328
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,170
Don't say that.

2329
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,540
- At least that man confessed.
- Jukjae was a player.

2330
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,570
- Jukjae.
- Jukjae was a player.

2331
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:42,850
Jukjae, were you a player?

2332
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:45,270
- Were you?
- It's a lighthearted suggestion.

2333
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:48,070
I bet it was
the third call of the day.

2334
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:49,810
- Suk Jin, no.
- No.

2335
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:51,390
I bet it was a group message.

2336
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:53,150
- No.
- He sent a group message.

2337
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,680
It was the 3rd call.
It wasn't the 1st call.

2338
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:57,290
- I...
- Jukjae, explain it yourself.

2339
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:58,560
- Jukjae, the songwriter.
- It's not like...

2340
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,220
It's not like I reached an old age,

2341
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:02,100
but I can say this
from my experience.

2342
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:03,630
What's said in a drunken state
ends that way.

2343
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:06,190
- So...
- It ends that way.

2344
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:09,010
What's said in a drunken state
ends that way.

2345
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:12,380
If I compare the two men to liquor,

2346
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:16,510
the man in Song B is like
undiluted whiskey.

2347
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:19,140
But that punk, Jukjae...

2348
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:20,750
- is like...
- Jukjae.

2349
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:23,140
- heavily diluted whiskey.
- On the rock.

2350
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:24,720
- It's light.
- On the rock.

2351
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,510
- Look at the lyrics.
- He is lighthearted.

2352
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:29,150
The man in Song B goes,
"This won't happen again."

2353
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:31,090
- He won't confess his love again.
- No.

2354
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:33,630
But you know how players are.

2355
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:35,060
"Where are you? What are you up to?"

2356
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,630
"Really? Okay."
Then he calls another woman.

2357
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:37,630
"Where are you? What are you up to?"

2358
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:38,640
No way.

2359
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,730
"I am home." Then he goes,

2360
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:43,260
"Let's go see the stars."
He does that.

2361
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,840
- He is a player.
- The man in Song A is a player.

2362
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,270
The man in Song A knows
that this woman likes him.

2363
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:50,940
- That's right.
- He is too confident.

2364
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,920
- He already knows it.
- That's right.

2365
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,510
- That confidence is an eyesore.
- That's right.

2366
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:57,750
Seriously.

2367
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:59,680
- He knows.
- Jukjae.

2368
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,820
- That kind of confidence...
- Can you erase Jukjae's name?

2369
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:04,650
"You are bound to come out..."

2370
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:06,500
- "and go see the stars with me."
- That's right.

2371
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,520
- Hey.
- "Just put on a light jacket."

2372
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,600
(He feels dizzy.)

2373
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,760
"We won't go anywhere far."

2374
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,600
If she doesn't like the situation,

2375
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,360
she can go home.

2376
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:18,600
- It shows his consideration.
- In any case,

2377
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:20,770
he knows...

2378
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:23,810
that she likes him.
That's why he is behaving that way.

2379
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:27,510
I think A will be successful
and B will be unsuccessful.

2380
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:29,590
- Not necessarily.
- That's what I think.

2381
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:31,310
- That's right.
- The lyrics...

2382
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:33,980
I think the situation in Song B
is too oily.

2383
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,650
And I feel like I have to lead him.

2384
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:38,850
- It's like, "So what?"
- Isn't the other one oilier?

2385
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:41,100
The man in Song A
makes my heart flutter more...

2386
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,300
- because he leads me.
- That's right.

2387
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,820
That's right.
That's a better confession of love.

2388
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:45,860
The man in Song B...

2389
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:49,360
Which confession of love
do you prefer?

2390
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,510
- One, two, three.
- The man in Song A is a player.

2391
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,340
This goes without saying.

2392
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:54,730
You chose A.

2393
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:56,750
A... Now...

2394
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,600
- It's 5 to 4.
- It's 5 to 4.

2395
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,640
The staff members will vote now.

2396
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:01,810
- All right.
- Seriously.

2397
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:04,440
Which confession of love
do you prefer?

2398
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:05,650
Which one is more sincere?

2399
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:07,420
- Men would agree.
- One...

2400
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,180
- It's more sincere.
- You know Exhibition.

2401
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,650
One, two, three.

2402
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:11,790
It's tacky, but B is better.

2403
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,150
- A.
- It's A.

2404
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:15,000
- It's B.
- It's A.

2405
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,190
- A.
- One, two, three, four.

2406
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:17,300
- five, six, seven...
- A.

2407
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,670
- B is sincere.
- All men chose B. It's so funny.

2408
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:20,930
All men chose B.

2409
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:22,710
- B has depth.
- It's A.

2410
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:23,730
- More people chose B.
- More people chose B.

2411
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:24,860
- More people chose B.
- B got two more votes.

2412
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,230
- Did it get two more votes?
- More people chose B.

2413
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:27,680
- B won.
- So Min.

2414
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,900
- That's right. It's better.
- Those who chose B...

2415
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:32,010
will receive a point.

2416
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:35,480
- It's more serious.
- Jukjae, I am sorry.

2417
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,420
Now comes the result of the mission.

2418
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,310
- We won all the points.
- Team Jukjae placed first.

2419
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:41,720
Team Haha placed second.

2420
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,480
Team BE'O placed third.

2421
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,350
- All right.
- Jae Suk didn't get one right.

2422
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:46,720
- What's wrong with you?
- I didn't get one right.

2423
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,260
This time, you will receive
five coins each.

2424
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:52,540
- All right.
- The 3rd place can exchange 1st.

2425
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,690
It's so nice.

2426
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:55,430
Shall we exchange the cards?

2427
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:57,840
- Sure. It doesn't matter.
- Shall we exchange the cards?

2428
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,640
We can exchange two cards.

2429
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:01,840
- This one?
- Take whatever you want.

2430
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,010
- Okay.
- Please show it to the camera.

2431
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:07,140
(It's a Poop Card!)

2432
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,640
It's yours.

2433
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,480
We should take a card
from Jae Suk's team.

2434
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:16,150
(Team Jukjae aims
for Team BE'O's card.)

2435
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:18,930
It's the second place's turn
to exchange a card.

2436
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:20,600
I will use three star coins.

2437
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:21,930
Hurry up and distribute the cards.

2438
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,560
- What?
- Distribute the cards.

2439
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,220
We will exchange cards
with Jae Suk's team.

2440
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:26,860
Let's check BE'O's card.

2441
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:27,860
- BE'O's card.
- BE'O's card.

2442
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,470
- Show them.
- Show us.

2443
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:30,670
BE'O, come on out.

2444
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:33,810
Okay.

2445
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:35,680
We can exchange cards now, right?

2446
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,550
- Jae Suk's card?
- Go ahead.

2447
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:38,550
- Jae Suk's card.
- Jae Suk's card.

2448
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:39,570
Jae Suk.

2449
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:42,090
- Don't you have three Poop Cards?
- They were outside earlier.

2450
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,180
We will exchange cards
with Jae Suk.

2451
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,890
(Will they get a Star Card?)

2452
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:50,650
(Gold star)

2453
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:52,220
(They got a gold star!)

2454
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:53,500
Thank goodness.

2455
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:57,500
(Team BE'O lost a Star Card!)

2456
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,890
(Team Haha's current cards)

2457
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,670
(Star-Poop-Star?)

2458
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:02,140
The first place...

2459
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:07,270
(After the first mission,
Team Haha got a bronze star.)

2460
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,940
(Don't you have three Poop Cards?)

2461
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:13,380
(The Poop Trio acted like
they only had the Poop Cards.)

2462
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:16,980
The 1st place can exchange
up to 2 cards.

2463
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,350
Can we exchange one card
with each team?

2464
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:19,650
- Yes. It doesn't matter.
- You can.

2465
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,180
Seeing as how
she is holding it up...

2466
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,790
It must be a Star Card.

2467
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:27,150
Since she wants us to take it,
we shouldn't take it.

2468
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:28,150
(Suk Jin wants to exchange cards
with Team BE'O.)

2469
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:29,760
- Take Jae Suk's card.
- Okay.

2470
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:31,890
Did you get it just now?

2471
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,230
- No?
- What are you doing?

2472
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:35,640
I received it.

2473
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,710
Did you get it just now?

2474
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:37,860
I can't tell you.

2475
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,600
- Exchange cards with Team Haha.
- Team Haha.

2476
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,840
Let's see.

2477
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,180
Let's see.

2478
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,710
Okay.

2479
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:45,940
It's time for another exchange.

2480
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:48,050
Se Chan, you put it away carefully.

2481
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:49,050
- Carefully?
- Yes.

2482
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:50,090
I don't know which cards they are.

2483
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:51,180
We don't know either.

2484
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:52,850
Tell me when to stop.

2485
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,650
- Don't drop them.
- I will pick one.

2486
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:56,220
- What?
- I don't know.

2487
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:57,560
Did you want another card?

2488
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:58,890
Why did you exchange cards
with Team Haha?

2489
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:00,600
Team BE'O would have been
a better choice.

2490
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,970
This time, the team that will get
the most amount of food...

2491
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:06,930
is Team Haha.

2492
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,900
- We can eat for free.
- We need to go outside.

2493
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:10,140
We can eat for free.

2494
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,060
- The second place is Team Jukjae.
- We like being outside.

2495
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,470
Ji Hyo, we grilled potatoes
and sweet potatoes.

2496
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,440
- Eat them.
- The third place is Team BE'O.

2497
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,380
Please move to your spot.

2498
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:19,510
We need to protect the cards now.

2499
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:21,010
We got lucky.

2500
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:22,940
Let's eat.

2501
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:24,790
We should have gone there.

2502
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:26,420
We are always here.

2503
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,460
It's nice.

2504
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:30,350
- The view is nice from here.
- This place is amazing.

2505
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:31,890
Let's eat something.

2506
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:33,820
Se Chan, it looks nice from here.

2507
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,930
Don't even worry about the view.

2508
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,520
Chapagetti sounds delicious.

2509
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,260
Can we eat Chapagetti?

2510
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:40,360
Of course.

2511
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,310
- Shall we make one?
- Please make us Chapagetti.

2512
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:46,310
- We will support you.
- Give us two coins as collateral.

2513
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:48,310
If you do well,
we will give them back to you.

2514
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,900
Otherwise, we will keep them.

2515
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,010
If you betray us,
we will keep the coins.

2516
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:53,880
- Otherwise, you will get them back.
- How about one?

2517
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,350
Two coins.
You won't betray us anyway.

2518
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:57,890
- We won't betray you.
- So give us two coins.

2519
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,560
Let them pay one coin.

2520
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,960
- One coin.
- Okay then.

2521
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,520
- Receive the collateral.
- The collateral.

2522
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,320
- Really?
- Choose what you want to eat.

2523
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,960
- It's the collateral.
- It's the collateral.

2524
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:08,220
It's a great deal.

2525
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:09,600
- Right?
- Yes.

2526
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,360
Here.

2527
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,670
(They complete the deal
with one coin as collateral.)

2528
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:13,860
We will eat one Chapagetti.

2529
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:14,890
Shall we make it?

2530
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:16,230
We will betray you.

2531
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:20,640
(Say hello to betrayal!)

2532
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:24,380
- That was too...
- You got fooled.

2533
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:25,380
(A betrayal
with no class whatsoever)

2534
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:28,050
That was so cheap.

2535
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,140
You stole 1, not 10 coins.

2536
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:33,260
(Se Chan feels embarrassed as well.)

2537
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:34,650
That was so cheap.

2538
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:37,260
Let's eat something. I am hungry.

2539
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:38,630
(It's time to savor the victory.)

2540
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:40,150
- This and...
- Let's microwave another one.

2541
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,970
(Suk Jin smelled food.)

2542
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,130
What's that?

2543
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:45,220
Crunchy fried chicken.

2544
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,300
- Crunchy fried chicken?
- This isn't crunchy fried chicken.

2545
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,600
We will eat it.

2546
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,670
(It's a conversation you would hear
at an elementary school.)

2547
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:51,930
Do you want it?

2548
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:53,540
You are so childish.

2549
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:55,040
Suk Jin, do you want it?

2550
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:57,070
Answer politely.

2551
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,850
(He is like a villain
in a tacky animated movie.)

2552
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:01,510
Yes, sir. I want it.

2553
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:02,550
All right.

2554
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:05,290
- I didn't expect such food.
- You are so nice.

2555
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:08,420
Okay. Open your mouth.
The airplane is coming.

2556
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,760
Can't you just give me
the whole thing?

2557
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,090
What?

2558
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:13,960
- I'm sorry.
- Open your mouth.

2559
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,970
Here comes the airplane.

2560
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:19,560
(The crunchy fried chicken airplane
finally took off as he got along.)

2561
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:20,670
(Opening his mouth)

2562
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:25,730
- That's childish.
- It's delicious.

2563
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:27,570
Give one to me.

2564
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:29,470
One coin. Yes.

2565
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:30,550
Try it.

2566
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:32,050
(While he was begging to
have one bite of fried chicken...)

2567
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,550
Try it.

2568
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:34,810
- What are you doing?
- Try it.

2569
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:38,350
- You baked the sweet potatoes.
- My gosh.

2570
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,420
Jae Suk. Have some potatoes.

2571
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:42,460
Should I?

2572
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:45,850
(Team BE'O will enjoy it.)

2573
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:48,260
- The previous team did a good job.
- Thank you.

2574
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:51,670
(The potatoes are cooked well
thanks to the fire they made.)

2575
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:52,690
Thank you.

2576
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:56,210
I wish I had one more coin.

2577
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:57,560
(It's even more delicious
as they didn't put any effort.)

2578
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,270
It's delicious.

2579
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,380
(Eating)

2580
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,470
- The potato is really good.
- Right?

2581
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:03,510
It's good.

2582
01:27:04,570 --> 01:27:07,610
- During this session,
- Yes.

2583
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:10,850
as I said earlier,
the wish of the one who collects...

2584
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:14,350
Star-Poop-Star the most
will be granted.

2585
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:16,790
Write down your wish...

2586
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:18,560
beforehand.

2587
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:19,560
My wish?

2588
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:23,320
You can write what you want
from the members.

2589
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,930
Or you can write something you want
from the staff,

2590
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:29,260
up to 1,000 dollars.

2591
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:34,640
Can I write something like this?
"Just leave me alone."

2592
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,680
I want nothing.
Oh, I could get rid of penalties.

2593
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,110
- No penalties.
- No penalties sounds good.

2594
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,940
You sang "Limousine."
Did you get one?

2595
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:43,940
- No.
- Why not?

2596
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:46,310
- I don't have a driver's license.
- You should get one first.

2597
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:49,460
(While he's dreaming of having
a black limousine without a license)

2598
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:53,320
Should I ask Jae Suk
to buy me an electric car?

2599
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:56,720
Write that you want Jae Suk
to appear in "Jiseokjin World."

2600
01:27:57,430 --> 01:28:00,640
He should come once.
I appeared in "Pinggyego" so many times.

2601
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:04,840
What should I write? My wish?

2602
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:06,380
They said we should go down.
Let's go.

2603
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:07,380
Let's go.

2604
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:08,970
The last mission...

2605
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:12,250
is Throw the Dice,
which is our signature game.

2606
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:14,640
Two people from each team
will throw the dice.

2607
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:16,390
- That's neat.
- The team...

2608
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:17,790
with bigger total numbers will win.

2609
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:19,960
That's neat.
The production team did a great job.

2610
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:23,260
The members who will throw it
are decided.

2611
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:26,060
Ji Hyo or BE'O can throw it.

2612
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:27,460
- Yes. Let's do it first.
- Okay.

2613
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:29,360
- Say that you'll do it.
- We should get six.

2614
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:33,840
- Jukjae, can you throw it?
- Yes. Here I go.

2615
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,260
(Gently)

2616
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:36,260
- Oh, my.
- That's good.

2617
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:37,710
- He threw it timidly.
- One.

2618
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:39,540
- Oh, my.
- It's...

2619
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:40,540
(Team Jukjae, 1)

2620
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,710
- Oh, my.
- Jukjae.

2621
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:43,350
You should've thrown it higher.

2622
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:45,550
- You should throw it like this.
- He threw it. It's over.

2623
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:47,940
He knows what to do
in a variety show.

2624
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:49,440
BE'O, throw the dice.

2625
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,550
- Let's get in the black limousine.
- Please.

2626
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:54,760
I get off from the black limousine

2627
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,320
He's doing well.

2628
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,850
(What number is on the dice?)

2629
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:02,000
- That's cool.
- One.

2630
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,060
- Three.
- Three. It isn't bad.

2631
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,260
- Three isn't bad.
- Not bad.

2632
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,100
- It's okay. They might do worse.
- Three isn't bad.

2633
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:09,310
Three isn't bad.

2634
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:10,560
- Blank.
- Please get one.

2635
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,730
- Let's see.
- Please get one.

2636
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:14,570
- Please be one.
- Let's see.

2637
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:17,070
What's wrong?

2638
01:29:17,070 --> 01:29:18,310
(The unlucky one
doesn't disappoint.)

2639
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:19,680
I told you.

2640
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,750
What's wrong with me?
I'm not really confident with dice.

2641
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,420
Gosh, it's so...

2642
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:25,920
- Here I go.
- Okay.

2643
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,350
- Go, Korea!
- Let's go.

2644
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:28,790
- Let's go.
- Let's go with six.

2645
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:29,850
- Let's go.
- Six.

2646
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:30,890
Go, Korea.

2647
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:33,190
(The soccer fan wishes
on his country before throwing it!)

2648
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:34,560
- Six.
- Go, Korea.

2649
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:36,690
- It's five. It's not bad.
- It's good.

2650
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:39,190
- It's the best for us.
- It's not bad.

2651
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:41,190
- If you get 6...
- Or 3 or more.

2652
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:42,560
- Six. Three or more.
- Please get six.

2653
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,470
- Or just get three or more. Ji Hyo.
- What did they get?

2654
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:46,900
- Let's go.
- One.

2655
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:48,710
(Please.)

2656
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:50,350
(Please get a lower number!)

2657
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:52,250
- Let's go.
- One.

2658
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:53,440
It's low.

2659
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,180
- Two.
- We're in the first place.

2660
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,440
(Team BE'O, 5)

2661
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:59,680
(Team Jukjae, 6)

2662
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,310
Jukjae, I told you.

2663
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:02,560
You never know.

2664
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,430
- I'll throw it.
- I'll throw it.

2665
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:06,760
- You're the best.
- I don't think he'll make it.

2666
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:09,150
- Here I go.
- Let's go.

2667
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:10,470
- Good luck.
- Let's get it.

2668
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:12,000
- It's six, Se Chan.
- It'd be amazing.

2669
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,190
- It's 6.
- Get 1, 2, or 3.

2670
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:15,930
As long as we aren't last.

2671
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:17,260
(Will they become the new number 1
or become the new last?)

2672
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:19,970
- Okay. It's not bad.
- It's not bad.

2673
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:21,900
(Team Haha, 5)

2674
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:22,970
We almost got one.

2675
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:23,970
- It's 5 in total.
- It's 5.

2676
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:25,380
- Then...
- We're tied.

2677
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:27,680
Team Jukjae is in the first place.

2678
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,920
- How?
- We're in the first place.

2679
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,140
The two teams are tied.

2680
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,920
- So throw the dice once.
- Just once more.

2681
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,890
- Okay. You throw it, So Min.
- So Min.

2682
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,060
(So Min from Team Haha will try it.)

2683
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:37,060
- You do it. Yes.
- I'll do it.

2684
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:40,720
(What will Referee Jeon who was
mistreated all day get?)

2685
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:42,390
Where is it going?

2686
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:45,320
- Yes!
- Oh, my.

2687
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,100
(She transformed from Referee Jeon
into the ace.)

2688
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:50,310
- So Min, you're indeed our ace.
- That was amazing.

2689
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:53,570
She's a lucky one.

2690
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:55,900
(Team BE'O is getting more nervous.)

2691
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,380
- It's not me.
- Just get six.

2692
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:58,850
If they get six,
they should do it again.

2693
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:00,940
(The fate of Team BE'O
depends on the unlucky one.)

2694
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:03,310
Move over.

2695
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:04,390
Where is it?

2696
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:08,720
- It's two. Okay.
- Okay.

2697
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:12,520
- Success.
- It went too far in the back.

2698
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,760
We'll become last.

2699
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,320
First place, Team Jukjae.
Second place, Team Haha.

2700
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:16,860
Third place, Team BE'O.

2701
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,260
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

2702
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:21,560
Again, if you trade now, that's it.

2703
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,340
- Okay. We got two.
- Okay.

2704
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,260
Let's see the wishes...

2705
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:28,810
- you wrote earlier and trade.
- Yes.

2706
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:30,350
- "Penalty transfer card?"
- What did Suk Jin write?

2707
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:31,680
(Wish list)

2708
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:32,880
- "Penalty transfer card?"
- "Penalty transfer card?"

2709
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,440
They wrote the same thing as me.

2710
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:37,050
Suk Jin wants MSG Wannabe to be
on "Running Man" with a new song?

2711
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:38,550
Yes. Just in case
you release a new song.

2712
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:40,150
(Haha's long boots
shipped from abroad)

2713
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:42,310
"Haha's long boots
shipped from abroad."

2714
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:43,960
- What does it mean?
- He wants them.

2715
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,630
The long boots. It's my wish.

2716
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:48,890
(The rumor says
Haha cherishes the long boots.)

2717
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:52,690
(During the show-throwing mission
in the fall special)

2718
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:54,930
(He cares about the boots
more than his own body.)

2719
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:56,430
(I waited for 1 year to get it!)

2720
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,170
They asked me to write a wish.

2721
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:01,880
I wrote "No penalties."

2722
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:04,270
- "Penalty transfer."
- "Transfer."

2723
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:07,010
"No penalties, Haha's long boots
shipped from abroad,"

2724
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:08,010
"Donate 1,000 dollars
under my name." by So Min.

2725
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:09,010
That's funny. 1,000 dollars.

2726
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:10,250
That's heart-warming.

2727
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:11,250
(It's a heart-warming wish
at the end of the year.)

2728
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,680
Jukjae wants them to play
his song from his second album.

2729
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:14,790
- That one is good too.
- That's nice.

2730
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:16,150
- That's good too.
- Next week.

2731
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:17,480
BE'O wrote
"One Running Man appearance."

2732
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,430
- That's great.
- BE'O.

2733
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:20,720
- This one is nice.
- "With the member I want."

2734
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:21,820
- That's good.
- That's good.

2735
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:23,320
Who do you want to come with?

2736
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,100
Gray.

2737
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:26,430
- Gray?
- Gray?

2738
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:28,340
- Gray.
- Gray is nice.

2739
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:29,360
Gray sounds good.

2740
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,640
- Gray is good.
- It sounds good.

2741
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:32,730
- He's good-looking.
- I like Gray.

2742
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:33,730
He's nice.

2743
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:36,750
You're going to trade one last time.

2744
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:39,070
Team BE'O can pick one...

2745
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:41,250
and trade first.

2746
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:44,640
You should use five coins
to check it this time.

2747
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:48,060
It means the rankings
aren't decided yet.

2748
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:51,520
It's unfavorable for us though.

2749
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,560
(Team Jukjae: Silver star, 2 poop)

2750
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,560
Do we have ten?

2751
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,150
(Team Jukjae: Silver star, 2 poop)

2752
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,930
- How many do we have?
- We got just five.

2753
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:57,930
It's a relief.

2754
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,300
- We'll take it.
- Okay.

2755
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:02,640
We'll take So Min's.

2756
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,540
- Use all of them.
- Let's use all of them. We got ten.

2757
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:07,640
First, we'll check So Min's.

2758
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,880
(He checks So Min's card first.)

2759
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,140
Get close to the camera.

2760
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:11,880
Go back.

2761
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:15,770
- Why? Do you have a poop card?
- We can see it too.

2762
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:16,810
We can see it too.

2763
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:18,180
- I'll see yours.
- Yes. Come here.

2764
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:19,680
In front of the camera.

2765
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,260
(He peeked at the golden card.)

2766
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:24,320
We'll trade with Se Chan.

2767
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:26,150
Are you going to make it so obvious?

2768
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:27,690
We'll give you a star too.

2769
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:29,720
- Really?
- Yes. We'll give you a star.

2770
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,890
- Are you sure?
- We got stars only.

2771
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:34,340
Did you get it
to become first place?

2772
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:35,840
We should mix them.

2773
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,170
Jae Suk.

2774
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:38,900
He was right. Thank you.

2775
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,640
Second place, Team Haha,

2776
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:43,570
you can trade one.

2777
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:45,210
We'll trade with Jae Suk.

2778
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:47,140
- Let me see.
- Let's see. Mix them.

2779
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:48,610
- Each of us should have one.
- Five?

2780
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:51,050
I got it
after Suk Jin betrayed me earlier.

2781
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:52,550
- So Min, who should we choose?
- I want to see BE'O's.

2782
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:54,650
Let's check BE'O's card and take
Jae Suk's card if it's bad.

2783
01:33:54,650 --> 01:33:55,980
- Yes. Let's do that.
- BE'O.

2784
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:57,460
- Let's see it together.
- Come here.

2785
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:59,520
- Gosh.
- Why?

2786
01:34:00,150 --> 01:34:02,150
- They changed it.
- No, we didn't.

2787
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:04,430
- We didn't.
- You can't do that.

2788
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:05,970
We didn't change it.

2789
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:07,470
Change it.

2790
01:34:07,470 --> 01:34:08,640
Let's just trade.

2791
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,170
- Take it.
- Show us.

2792
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:11,970
We traded.

2793
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:13,470
(They traded the card with Ji Hyo,
not Jae Suk. What will happen?)

2794
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:17,010
Now, Team Jukjae can trade
up to two cards...

2795
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:18,440
or keep the status quo.

2796
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:21,140
- Jukjae, who do you want?
- Pick the one you want.

2797
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:22,550
- So Min...
- Yes. So Min.

2798
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:23,980
So Min, go see the stars with him.

2799
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,510
- Really?
- Go see the stars.

2800
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:27,610
They're really going
to see the stars.

2801
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:31,760
(The bystanders in the back
are more excited about it.)

2802
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:43,560
(Team Jukjae decided to check
So Min's card.)

2803
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:47,030
(Here comes the gold star.)

2804
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:48,230
(Grinning)

2805
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:52,160
I'll trade.

2806
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,240
Thank you.

2807
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:57,530
That was a good guess.

2808
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:59,480
- That was amazing.
- I knew you would do it.

2809
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,040
- We won't change any more.
- Good.

2810
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,480
Then the race is over now.

2811
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,740
It's a bummer.

2812
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,740
I'm sad.

2813
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:08,410
We will reveal the results
of today's race.

2814
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:10,950
Team Haha will go first.

2815
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:12,620
Star.

2816
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:14,280
- It's not a star. It's poop.
- It's a Poop Card.

2817
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,320
- Star, poop, and...
- Star and poop. Right.

2818
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,450
It's poop, star, poop.

2819
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:19,860
Next up is Team BE'O.

2820
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:21,860
- It's all Poop Cards.
- Poop.

2821
01:35:22,030 --> 01:35:23,700
(Poop, poop, poop)

2822
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:25,960
- That's the worst.
- Is that possible?

2823
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:29,030
- Is it possible?
- This is the worst.

2824
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:32,040
Now, Team Jukjae,
show us your cards.

2825
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,350
Start. Star.

2826
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:34,610
- Poop.
- Star.

2827
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:35,850
(Star, poop, star)

2828
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:37,110
- They were good.
- Jukjae did a good job.

2829
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:39,540
It's not just a star.
It's a silver star.

2830
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:43,450
So your wish will be granted.

2831
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:45,860
- Okay.
- Your songs will be on Running Man.

2832
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:47,580
- This is great.
- It's huge.

2833
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:49,560
All right then.

2834
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,960
Team Haha who got
2 Poop Cards and 1 Star Card...

2835
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:55,330
- will get a small penalty.
- What is it?

2836
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:56,740
The small penalty is...

2837
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:59,330
to write New Year's cards...

2838
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:01,030
to the members of Running Man.

2839
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:03,740
Is this small?

2840
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:05,950
- It's bothersome.
- It's really hard.

2841
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:07,150
- What's the big penalty?
- It's really bothersome.

2842
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:09,520
- What's the big penalty then?
- It's really tiresome.

2843
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,070
What's the big one?

2844
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:14,650
Team BE'O with three Poop Cards...

2845
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:18,450
will get water slaps
to fight the winter cold.

2846
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:20,250
- I want to do that.
- This is better.

2847
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:21,860
Get water slaps
to fight the winter cold.

2848
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:23,450
(I want to do that!)

2849
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:25,660
- I'll get a water slap.
- That's better.

2850
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:27,320
- Let me go home.
- This is fun.

2851
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,290
- This is not right.
- This is a lot better.

2852
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:30,860
- Hey.
- This is a lot better.

2853
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,330
Jae Suk, this is better.

2854
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:33,640
I like it better.

2855
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,500
- This is a lot better.
- This is easy.

2856
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:36,980
- I like it.
- This is better.

2857
01:36:37,410 --> 01:36:39,570
You three can give us
water slaps before you leave.

2858
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:41,110
- Sure.
- Okay.

2859
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:42,610
Let's start the penalties.

2860
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:45,490
- Why is this small?
- Why is this a small penalty?

2861
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:46,950
I'll just shower here.

2862
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:48,710
All right then.
We will get water slaps then.

2863
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:50,160
One at a time.

2864
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,520
(Aiming at his protruding mouth)

2865
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:52,990
It won't be bad.

2866
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:54,450
It went to the side.

2867
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,660
- All right.
- Good one.

2868
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:58,030
- You're good at this.
- Hey.

2869
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:00,620
- All right.
- Good one.

2870
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:02,160
(He got splashed
trying to use his strength.)

2871
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,530
He got splashed.

2872
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:05,270
Why did you get splashed?

2873
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:08,360
He keeps getting splashed.
That's so funny.

2874
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,670
The big penalties are over.

2875
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:13,740
Team Haha will stay here
and finish their penalties.

2876
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,480
- Okay.
- This isn't a small penalty.

2877
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,610
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2878
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:20,080
- Good work today.
- Good work.

2879
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,390
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2880
01:37:21,390 --> 01:37:22,780
We're leaving now.

2881
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:24,110
- We will get going.
- Bye.

2882
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,580
- Bye.
- This is a lot better.

2883
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:26,780
Bye.

2884
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:29,100
"Happy and..."
What else should I say?

2885
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:32,100
If I don't like the card,
can I ask them to write again?

2886
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,120
(Trying to come up with something)

2887
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:36,740
I just keep saying thank you.

2888
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:40,070
(Thankful... Grateful...)

2889
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:41,360
(And thankful again...)

2890
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,610
All right. I'm done.

2891
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:45,650
- Okay.
- Done.

2892
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:46,670
All right. Thank you.

2893
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:48,480
Thank you.

2894
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:53,390
(We thank Jukjae and BE'O
for joining us with shining smiles.)

2895
01:37:53,690 --> 01:37:55,690
(They are gathered together
to enjoy Christmas.)

2896
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:57,780
(Santa Yoo and six Rudolphs)

2897
01:37:58,580 --> 01:37:59,860
(The unusual VIP treatment...)

2898
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:01,620
(makes them suspicious.)

2899
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:04,660
(They can't go home
before giving out all the gifts?)

2900
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:05,960
I thought it was strange.

2901
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,100
(She's not swearing.)

2902
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:08,270
(Shoe...)

2903
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:10,770
(The members show off
their poor stamina as always.)

2904
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,530
(And the citizens are just as bad.)

2905
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,030
(Will they be able to go home?)

2906
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:18,570
(Even the citizens
turn away from them.)

2907
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,670
(But they give out the gifts
they chose with their whole hearts.)

2908
01:38:22,210 --> 01:38:26,610
(The great gifts that will
give people precious memories)

2909
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:29,080
(Congratulations)

2910
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:31,450
(It's Christmas,
so you shouldn't be disappointed.)

2911
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,660
(Santa Yoo and Six Rudolphs)
