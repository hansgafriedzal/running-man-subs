(November, 2022)

12
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,360
(December, 2022)

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,460
It's done.

14
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,270
It's the luxury street.

15
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,770
- It's Christmas.
- My gosh.

16
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,540
- This is cute.
- Gosh, this is...

17
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,960
- Hello.
- Hey.

18
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,500
Hello.

19
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,300
Your hair looks so cute.

20
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,770
Suk Jin, I like your outfit today.

21
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,610
- You do?
- But your pants...

22
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,000
- Your compliment is unexpected.
- I like the top, but the pants...

23
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,250
Don't you think
his pants don't look right?

24
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,350
They are pretty.

25
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,710
The pants are the key, you fool.

26
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,710
They are the key.

27
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,610
Why do you call her a fool?

28
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,320
So Min is not a fool.

29
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,460
I'm not a fool.

30
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,580
- You're a fashion fool.
- She's dressed like a fool.

31
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,080
- Hello.
- Hi, Dong Hoon.

32
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,680
- Hello.
- Hello, Haha.

33
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,820
- Hey, Haha.
- You're simply dressed today.

34
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,430
- You look nice today.
- I like that.

35
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,690
- It looks plain.
- Right.

36
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,460
- You're like a lord today.
- It's just fine.

37
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,260
By the way,
Ji Hyo's dress is really...

38
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,170
- It's like hairtail.
- It really stands out.

39
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,410
This is just like
what you wore last week.

40
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,680
- Yes, it's the same.
- Right.

41
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,910
I wore something like this.

42
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,600
It's my dress,
but it's too dazzling even for me.

43
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,640
It looks pretty though.
We can't see it anyway.

44
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Why are you suddenly shy?

45
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,910
- This is Christmas Special today.
- Okay.

46
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,790
So we are opening
at a cafe where you can feel...

47
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,130
the spirit of Christmas.

48
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,290
- That's right.
- It's Christmas already.

49
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,100
- This is nice.
- How time flies.

50
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,800
Merry Christmas.

51
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,600
- Time goes by so quickly.
- It flies so fast.

52
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,000
Now I'm as old as Santa Claus.

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,270
I'm so old.

54
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,770
We prepared some refreshments too.

55
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,910
- Please enjoy them while you talk.
- Okay.

56
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,600
- This place is very famous.
- The food is good here.

57
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,680
You have to make a reservation
before coming here.

58
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,640
- It's Christmas.
- This looks delicious.

59
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,020
This looks like luxury goods.

60
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,320
- This is cute.
- It's so pretty.

61
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,630
- When I'm at a place like this...
- Can we eat this now?

62
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,960
Yes, please enjoy it.

63
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,800
- Can we eat? That's surprising.
- Just like this?

64
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
- It's a party.
- Because it's Christmas.

65
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,890
My gosh.

66
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,360
- Can we really eat this?
- We can't just eat this...

67
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
- without Christmas carols.
- Right.

68
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,370
But we have to play
only Jukjae's songs today.

69
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,000
- I see.
- Oh, right.

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,100
(The reason they should play
Jukjae's songs instead of carols...)

71
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,380
- What?
- Start.

72
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,090
(Last week,
Jukjae got his wish granted.)

73
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,120
(Play the songs from
Jukjae's 2nd album last week.)

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,820
(Jukjae's wish)

75
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,480
- This is great.
- It's huge.

76
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,590
- I see.
- Oh, right.

77
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,480
Can't we listen
to Christmas carols then?

78
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,600
His new songs?

79
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,750
- Then Jukjae's songs...
- His songs are...

80
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,400
- somewhat gloomy.
- Aren't they ballad songs?

81
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,760
- His new songs.
- There's no dance song.

82
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,440
Maybe we will need some other songs.

83
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,760
I should talk to Jukjae
and work on his songs.

84
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,910
Tell him to sing bright songs.

85
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,410
He should change the lyrics.
He's such a playboy.

86
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,380
I looked through
the lyrics of his songs.

87
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,700
- He's not pure.
- He's not that pure and innocent.

88
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,350
- It's quite erotic.
- It is. He's a player.

89
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,290
- Right?
- He's really funny.

90
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,010
Gosh, this is so delicious.

91
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,510
- It's good.
- He's funny.

92
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,690
This is good. Try it.

93
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,950
- What? There's nothing left.
- Just try it.

94
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,630
(What? There's nothing left.)

95
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,000
- There's nothing.
- Just scrape it off the plate.

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,070
Eat this? Suk Jin...

97
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,790
Suk Jin tells me to try this.

98
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,200
But he ate it all.

99
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,600
- There's nothing.
- You should just taste it.

100
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Just taste it.

101
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,200
Oh, right. It was
Se Chan's birthday last week.

102
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,100
What did you do on your birthday?

103
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,720
I did a TV show with your girlfriend
on your birthday,

104
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,320
and she worried about you a lot.

105
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,350
- Who's my girlfriend?
- So Min.

106
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,720
- Hey, who else would it be?
- I was surprised.

107
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,010
Of course, it's So Min.

108
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,480
- I was startled.
- So Min.

109
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,690
This looks like the bait
on "The Fishermen and the City."

110
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,100
(Halibuts and rockfishes will like
her hairstyle.)

111
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,530
- To catch yellowtail amberjack.
- This is...

112
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,130
- Yellowtail. A fishing lure.
- A fishing lure.

113
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,040
I'm trying to fish with my hair.

114
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,340
Take the bait. Bite it.

115
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,700
I think So Min likes...

116
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,200
- Se Chan a little.
- Why?

117
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,310
Because So Min adores him a lot.

118
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,940
Today, she kept saying
Se Chan was cute and adorable.

119
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,410
- Hello.
- This is so cute.

120
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,510
(Before the opening)

121
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,940
Isn't Se Chan cute?

122
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,350
I should say as So Min says.

123
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,190
(Rudolph Yang got a lot of love
as soon as he got here.)

124
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,950
Actually... I told you before.

125
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,000
If Se Chan asks So Min out
with an enthusiastic attitude,

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,790
she's ready to open her heart.

127
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,630
When they first started
the business couple,

128
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,970
I honestly thought it was ridiculous
and So Min could do better.

129
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,360
But I don't feel that way anymore.

130
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,410
I think you could
probably do better.

131
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,010
(I think you could
probably do better.)

132
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,910
- And...
- I'm saying...

133
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,240
- It's not like that.
- Se Chan could do better?

134
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,610
I'm just saying this because...
If you think about the looks,

135
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,310
you are a lot better.

136
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,520
But he has such a good personality.

137
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,290
- What about So Min?
- I don't have a good personality?

138
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,480
- What is he saying?
- You do have a good personality.

139
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,350
After spending some time, I realized
he's a really nice person.

140
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,100
I know what you mean.
You're right about that.

141
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,530
- He's nice, isn't he?
- Yes, you're right.

142
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,540
In the long run,
he can make a good husband.

143
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,060
Does that mean you realized
that I wasn't so good?

144
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,640
That's not it. Why are you being
so extreme? That's your problem.

145
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,800
See? This is what I'm saying.

146
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,600
- Don't be so extreme.
- Don't get him wrong.

147
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,370
You're a nice person too.
I just think...

148
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,310
he can make a good husband.

149
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,870
- Right.
- What makes you think so?

150
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,410
- Looks aren't everything.
- Exactly.

151
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,610
As I said, this episode will
go on air on Christmas.

152
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,530
And we can't talk about Christmas
without mentioning gifts.

153
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,530
- Right.
- That's true.

154
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,600
So I'd like to give you gifts
to thank you for your hard work.

155
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
- Really?
- It's really okay.

156
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,230
- Are you serious?
- We will go to a mall soon.

157
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,230
- Seriously?
- We will?

158
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,900
You can choose any gift you want...

159
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,600
up to the purchase limit
of 300 dollars.

160
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,360
- Really?
- I need to buy some plates.

161
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,510
- Really?
- Are you serious?

162
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,640
For myself, not for the members?

163
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,280
- Yes. Whatever you want.
- Seriously?

164
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,600
You can buy
windshield wiper fluids if you want.

165
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,370
- Okay.
- You can buy daily necessities.

166
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,650
He buys windshield wiper fluids
every time he goes to a mall.

167
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,790
- Why is that?
- I always buy...

168
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,220
- razors, batteries...
- Right. Batteries.

169
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,910
- I will use them eventually.
- He's very frugal.

170
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,350
He's really nice.

171
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,590
I will use them eventually.
It's not a waste.

172
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,600
What do you want to buy, So Min?

173
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,120
I'll buy chicken towels.
I mean, kitchen towels.

174
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,860
Chicken towels?

175
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,330
(Chicken towels...)

176
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,060
(Kitchen towels!)

177
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
(She realized it a little too late.)

178
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,300
- Gosh, if you didn't know that...
- That was close.

179
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,930
That's what Empty Heads find
most confusing. Chicken and kitchen.

180
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,080
- Kitchen.
- Chicken towel?

181
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,600
- What is it for?
- Is it for goose bumps?

182
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,350
- Is it made with chicken skin?
- I mean kitchen towels.

183
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,110
- I need kitchen towels.
- Chicken towels must be greasy.

184
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,890
What is a chicken towel for, So Min?

185
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,180
- What's wrong with me?
- It can happen.

186
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,260
- It sounds similar.
- Right.

187
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,720
A lot of people find it confusing.

188
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,100
Ji Hyo, what will you buy?

189
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,160
I'll buy some vegetables.

190
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,660
- Vegetables?
- Vegetables?

191
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,220
- What's with her?
- She's unique.

192
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,640
Will you buy
300 dollars worth of vegetables?

193
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,200
- I will...
- They all are strange.

194
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,560
My dog is...

195
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,800
My dog is a vegetarian.

196
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,510
- So I'll buy vegetables for my dog.
- A vegetarian dog.

197
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,100
- Let's play rock-paper...
- Suk Jin, what do you want?

198
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,300
I want...

199
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,370
- I have no idea.
- I think 300 dollars isn't enough.

200
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,240
He wants to play rock-paper-scissors
so the winner takes all the money.

201
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,810
- He wants more money.
- He's unbelievable.

202
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,810
That's your problem.

203
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,260
- Because I want good headphones.
- That's right.

204
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,830
- You can buy one for 300 dollars.
- I gave you wireless earphones.

205
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,990
You can use them.

206
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm using them now.

207
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,900
But I want something thick
to use at home.

208
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,700
But we can't just give away
the gifts.

209
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,660
- That's not Running Man.
- Right.

210
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,040
While you shop around
and buy gifts for yourselves,

211
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,080
you have to carry around
Yoo Jae Suk...

212
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,370
who was selected
as the children's idol in 2022...

213
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,810
so his feet won't touch the ground
the whole time.

214
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,220
(They have to carry
around Jae Suk.)

215
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,610
(Jae Suk's feet aren't supposed
to touch the ground all day.)

216
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,410
- My goodness.
- It sounds all right.

217
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,680
- Hang on.
- Wait.

218
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,090
Why does it have to be me?

219
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,480
Was he selected
as the children's idol?

220
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,700
Yes. Since this is Christmas,

221
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,660
- we're doing this for children.
- Thank you so much.

222
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,120
When will he stop coming in first?

223
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,560
"When will he stop coming in first?"

224
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,270
When will it end?

225
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,410
Every time the children's idol,
Yoo Jae Suk's feet touch the ground,

226
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,210
the shoot of our first episode
in 2023...

227
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,950
- will be moved up by ten minutes.
- What?

228
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,780
(The first shoot of 2023
will be moved up by 10 minutes.)

229
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,170
- Ten minutes?
- Hang on.

230
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,370
- The first shoot of 2023?
- What time does it start?

231
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,310
We usually start the shoot at 10 a.m.

232
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,040
- Then...
- We're fine with that.

233
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,020
It's good that we're doing this
with me.

234
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,960
- I'm easy to carry around.
- Right. You're light.

235
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,030
Yes, I am.

236
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,050
If Jae Suk's feet touch the ground,
and he takes a step,

237
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,700
- that makes it 20 minutes.
- Is it 20 minutes per step?

238
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,620
No. It's ten minutes
for touching the ground...

239
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,270
and another ten minutes
for taking a step.

240
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,560
- So that makes 20 minutes.
- This is going to be tough.

241
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Then we will probably
have to come at dawn.

242
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,910
I know.

243
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,410
So we thought it would be good
if we could...

244
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,500
if we could watch
the sunrise together.

245
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,320
- What?
- The sunrise? Hey.

246
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,200
Sunrise?

247
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,300
- Don't be ridiculous.
- She finally reveals her desire.

248
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,800
So you're doing this
to make us watch the sunrise.

249
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,060
You started showing
your true colors now.

250
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,770
- I will stay up all night.
- She's out of her mind.

251
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,670
- She's crazy.
- We can finish early then.

252
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,210
I'm okay with it.

253
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,800
I have no problem waking up at 5 a.m.

254
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,270
If he loses his mind
and walks around like crazy,

255
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,850
we have to catch him.

256
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,720
- He might go wild.
- We have to make him pass out.

257
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,280
Then we have to
catch him right away.

258
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,620
- So don't provoke me.
- If he gets carried away...

259
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,990
You know what I'm like.

260
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,780
- If I get carried away, I'll...
- I know.

261
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,960
You know that, right?

262
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,600
- Then we will knock you out.
- Okay.

263
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
We should be careful.

264
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,500
Or we should just let him go around
and start the shoot at night.

265
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,260
- I'd love that.
- I like it.

266
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,470
Move it up to the previous night.

267
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,740
But I don't want
to stay up all night.

268
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,640
So it's up to me.

269
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,210
- It's up to him.
- It depends on me.

270
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,880
We should keep him with Jong Kook.

271
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,770
- What do we do with the prankster?
- Right.

272
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,910
- Like a backpack.
- I can...

273
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,770
carry him around the whole time.
He's not that heavy.

274
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,990
- "He's not that heavy?"
- Right.

275
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,760
Then we will move to a mall.

276
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,680
- We will start counting now.
- Raise your legs.

277
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,760
It starts now?

278
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,860
Hang on.

279
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,730
If I walk around now, you will...

280
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,920
That's right.

281
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,100
Why are you threatening us?

282
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,920
That sounds threatening.

283
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,530
- So Min, I...
- No, Jae Suk.

284
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,160
- Let's carry him.
- Don't move.

285
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,710
- Just stay still.
- We can carry him.

286
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,240
- Don't lower your legs.
- Carry him on your back.

287
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,840
- He's light.
- I'll carry him.

288
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,610
I shouldn't step on the couch.

289
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,710
Is that why?

290
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,270
Rise on your knees.

291
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,910
- Wait.
- All right.

292
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,120
- Okay.
- Hang on.

293
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,270
All right.

294
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,510
Gosh, what's this?

295
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,910
You're so light.

296
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,890
- This is nice.
- He's really light.

297
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,780
I'm on Jong Kook's back.

298
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,780
- Thank you.
- Bye.

299
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,520
- Thank you.
- You're really light.

300
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,290
- Don't drop the prankster.
- All right.

301
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,520
The prankster.

302
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,190
This is the luxury alley.

303
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,190
- Gosh.
- All right.

304
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,160
- Jae Suk is really light.
- I'll carry you on my back.

305
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,870
- Let me carry you.
- Forget it. No thanks.

306
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,930
- Come on.
- Here.

307
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,030
All right.

308
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,930
- Gosh.
- He's so light.

309
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,980
- This is...
- It's nice to be on his back.

310
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,720
- By the way...
- We have a good worker.

311
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,440
Jae Suk is as light as a feather.

312
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,580
- Aren't I light?
- Yes.

313
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,220
My gosh.

314
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,620
I weigh only 61kg.

315
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Right.

316
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,180
- Do you weigh 61kg?
- Yes.

317
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,520
You are just like an idol artist.

318
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,390
- So Min, where are you going?
- Where are we going?

319
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,360
I want to go to Jimmy Choo.

320
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,130
- Yeongdeungpo.
- Jimmy Choo.

321
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,330
Are we going to Yeongdeungpo?

322
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,600
- So Min, where are we going?
- How did you know?

323
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,100
So Min said Yeongdeungpo.

324
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,560
Who told you that?

325
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,640
No one told me. It was my guess.

326
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,760
I will find out who it is.

327
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,980
- We're headed that way.
- Seriously, we should...

328
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,750
catch the spy.

329
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,010
We should narrow down the suspects
and interrogate them.

330
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,980
Actually, we don't have to do
anything about it.

331
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,540
It will only tire her out.

332
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,090
Why do you want to know?

333
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,490
It's not that I want to know.
I just...

334
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,890
Once she starts checking
her boyfriend's phone,

335
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,960
- she can't stop it.
- Right.

336
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,230
She knows it's wrong,
but she can't control herself.

337
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,660
- My wife...
- That's not right.

338
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,000
Like many, I keep my phone locked
because I work.

339
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,470
It could be a pattern
or a fingerprint.

340
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,210
But it unlocks when I get home.

341
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,300
- Why?
- How?

342
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,930
- My wife set it up.
- How would you do that?

343
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,800
- It's possible.
- How?

344
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,980
You can set it
to unlock automatically...

345
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,010
- when you go to certain places.
- Is that like a hack?

346
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
- What?
- A hack.

347
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,170
- Your phone has that function?
- That doesn't make sense.

348
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,750
- You can.
- Is it something you can set up?

349
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,280
So I just...

350
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,310
- I just feel comfortable this way.
- I see.

351
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,460
Suk Jin.

352
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,590
- Even in your car.
- You shouldn't do that.

353
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,860
Right.

354
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,790
(Sighing)

355
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,130
- You just sighed.
- I know.

356
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,420
(His story about the high-tech system
ends with a sigh.)

357
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,760
Do you fart in front of your wife?

358
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,690
Of course, he did.
He's been married...

359
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,530
- for over 30 years.
- Fart?

360
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,640
You can hear the roaring of guns
at his place.

361
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,250
It happened that way
for some unavoidable reasons.

362
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,580
- It sounds like an interceptor.
- Right.

363
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,440
(Boom)

364
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,580
Is it like an earthquake?

365
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,140
(Guns firing)

366
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,590
It's so loud.

367
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,760
Really loud.

368
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,150
I heard it was like a runway.

369
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,150
- It's really loud.
- With thrust.

370
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,760
A 3,000cc motorcycle.

371
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,460
- It's really loud.
- That's funny.

372
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,550
So Min.

373
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,230
- It's hilarious.
- I know.

374
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,370
(It's always fun
to talk about farting.)

375
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,930
- What do I need at home?
- For Dream,

376
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,340
I want to buy stuff like
a fish tank, a heater, and a filter.

377
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,580
You can buy a complete set.

378
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,930
I should buy a blanket.

379
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,010
How are you going to carry it home?

380
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,640
Hey, you always...

381
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,440
- I need a blanket.
- Why do you always...

382
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,670
try to buy household goods
on this show?

383
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,010
That's very useful.

384
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,640
- Hey, it's...
- Those who live alone do that.

385
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,260
- A winter blanket.
- They need something useful.

386
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,390
It's 300 dollars per person,
so it's 2,100 dollars in total.

387
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,390
- My gosh.
- Okay?

388
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,190
- I'll just buy some body lotion.
- I'll buy groceries.

389
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,020
You can't buy
300 dollars worth of body lotion.

390
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,830
- That one cost about that much.
- That one's a good brand.

391
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,100
Toothpaste?
I have enough toothpaste.

392
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,760
If you buy 300 dollars
worth of toothpaste...

393
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,400
- I can buy other stuff too.
- I can buy groceries.

394
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
- Once we get there,
- You'll know when we get there.

395
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,580
you will want
to buy a lot of things.

396
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,930
You can buy some beef.

397
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,270
- Right.
- What do you want, So Min?

398
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,380
- I'll go see.
- Wine.

399
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,640
- I can buy groceries or...
- So Min, I don't want you...

400
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,280
- to buy Se Chan a sweater.
- Can I get you anything?

401
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,590
- What?
- Do you need anything?

402
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,780
Then you should buy me a blanket.

403
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,180
- Me?
- Yes.

404
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,420
- Why do you need a blanket?
- I need one.

405
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,680
(Why do you need a blanket?)

406
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,230
(She blurts out something strange.)

407
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,960
She thinks it's a blanket for us.

408
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,830
- What's with her?
- No.

409
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,470
What's wrong with her?

410
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,230
- So Min is funny.
- Jeon So Bal.

411
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,100
I like it when he's flustered.

412
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,560
"Why do you need a blanket?"

413
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,710
- What will you buy?
- I'll...

414
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,380
- I'll buy my wife a gift.
- Cash...

415
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,480
Come on, Suk Jin.

416
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,610
- All of a sudden.
- Don't lie to us.

417
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,610
- Stop it.
- I'm serious.

418
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,270
I want to look like a good husband.

419
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,990
- My gosh.
- Do as you please.

420
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,780
What will you buy
for your wife at a mall?

421
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,890
- What will you buy?
- Perfume.

422
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,130
- I'm just curious.
- That's what I meant.

423
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,100
All right. I'll buy a perfume.

424
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,550
They also have some lotions.

425
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,520
And a Bluetooth...

426
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,260
Does your wife want
a Bluetooth product?

427
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,870
He's lying.

428
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,240
- He made that up.
- My wife is using earphones...

429
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,210
- that are relatively cheap.
- I see.

430
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,340
So I want to give her
something nicer.

431
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,110
Then you should give her
the ones I gave you.

432
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,580
No, that's for me.

433
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,880
That's mine.

434
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,910
- I gave it to you.
- Right.

435
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,490
Okay.

436
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,220
- We have to carry him.
- That's right.

437
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,490
We should carry him now.

438
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,620
Thank you.

439
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,360
Don't forget to carry
Jae Suk on your back.

440
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,990
- Let's carry him in our arms.
- Carry him on your back.

441
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,550
- Thank you.
- Let him sit on our arms.

442
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,290
- I can take just two steps.
- No.

443
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,190
- You can't do that.
- That's 20 minutes.

444
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,260
- No.
- We should try our best for now.

445
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,470
Then you can run away or something
at the last moment.

446
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,370
That's up to you.

447
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,160
- We'll try our best for now.
- My goodness.

448
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,240
We have to do this for now.

449
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,610
I'll carry you on my back, Suk Jin.

450
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,080
This is really comfortable though.

451
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,540
It's not hard.

452
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,310
You're not heavy at all.

453
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,580
This is comfortable.

454
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,280
It's not hard
carrying Jae Suk around.

455
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,010
This is nice.

456
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,090
Wait. I'll go see
if there's a cart we can use.

457
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,260
Okay. Go see if there's a cart.

458
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,460
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

459
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,830
Is there a cart or something?

460
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,150
We should find a wagon.

461
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,420
I bet there's something we can use.

462
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,390
- It's so nice to be here.
- I know.

463
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,690
Let's go eat a hamburger.

464
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,890
Shall we go eat a hamburger?

465
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,710
- We can eat later.
- Nice.

466
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,030
Jae Suk, wait here
while we're shopping.

467
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,340
No, we... I mean, I should go too.

468
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,640
- He needs to shop too.
- That's right.

469
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,110
- Let's look for it. Yes.
- A cart...

470
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,010
- Oh, that'll work. Can we use this?
- Yes.

471
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,390
No, this one. Let us use it.

472
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,890
Good. They found a cart.

473
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,310
- Oh, that's a trolly. Good.
- They found a trolly.

474
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,310
Guys, let's use this.

475
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,920
Let's borrow it.

476
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,460
Wait. You're doing it wrong.

477
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,360
- Is it ours?
- It's our team's.

478
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,190
- I see. That's great.
- I'm sorry. Please let us use it.

479
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,370
- Come here.
- I'll stand on it.

480
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,520
- But what about our staff?
- Hey, sit on it.

481
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,240
- Wait.
- Okay.

482
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,930
- Nice. This is much better.
- This is nice, indeed.

483
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,110
- Sit down. It's dangerous.
- Sit on it.

484
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,530
This is nice. It's much better.

485
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,770
- We need Jae Suk to stay healthy.
- Our dear Jae Suk.

486
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,900
We only have 30 minutes.
We need to hurry.

487
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,540
- Where? That way?
- Yes.

488
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,440
- They're carrying cameras.
- Let's go...

489
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,090
and check out some toys first.

490
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,180
- We'll need a shopping cart too.
- You're right.

491
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,650
Jae Suk, what do you want to buy?
Let's pick that up first.

492
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,650
(The members split up
and start shopping.)

493
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,130
Jae Suk, I see toys like LEGO.

494
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,760
- Where are those?
- I'll take you there.

495
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,830
- Hey, wait. Stop.
- Why?

496
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,420
I'm sorry, but can you turn me
around so that I can face forward?

497
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,870
- This is what you want, right?
- Yes.

498
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,140
- Over there.
- Okay.

499
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,370
Let's check out the toys.

500
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,300
(They found the toy aisle.)

501
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Jae Suk,
aren't you going to buy LEGO?

502
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,710
Toys are the best gifts
for Christmas.

503
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,040
(The paradise of children
with a Christmas vibe)

504
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,710
My, those look so nice.

505
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,620
I wish I could walk around
to have a look.

506
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,640
- Right?
- Yes.

507
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,620
- Next to us... That looks nice too.
- Look at that turtle ship.

508
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,010
I used to buy a lot of these.

509
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,220
- You mean, these?
- Yes.

510
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,150
(Singing)

511
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,020
I used to play a lot with Ji Ho
with this.

512
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,630
- That looks fun.
- This one?

513
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,260
"The Zombie Attack
on Police Bureau."

514
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,760
- Oh, my.
- Nice.

515
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,390
- I'm a bit hesitant to pick this.
- Why?

516
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,970
My children like playing with this,
but I have to do all the work.

517
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,530
- That's true. You'll have to do it.
- Oh, I see.

518
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,240
- I wish I could walk around.
- Jae Suk, sit down.

519
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,710
Wait. A fish-shaped bun store?

520
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,980
(A fish-shaped bun store toy
caught his eye this time.)

521
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,250
- They like making stuff,
- Do they like it?

522
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,740
but I have to be a customer
in their role-play.

523
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,320
(He'll have to role-play
with the kids.)

524
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
You know what I mean, right?

525
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,030
If I buy a cooking toy like this,

526
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,630
then I'll have to be their customer.

527
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,330
You see, toys like these
don't interest me at all.

528
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,490
- Really?
- I don't even know what they are.

529
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,190
Then go somewhere else
to choose your gift.

530
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,270
Then keep looking around here.

531
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,610
- I'll pick one and come back.
- Okay. Go on.

532
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,050
- Stay here for a while. Okay.
- I'll look around and ask for help.

533
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,080
This one looks nice.

534
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,470
(While looking for a blanket,
he got fascinated by a vacuum cleaner.)

535
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,620
Excuse me.

536
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,740
Excuse me.

537
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,250
Anyone... Excuse me.

538
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,450
(The strange customer
asks for someone to help him.)

539
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,490
Is this not for sale?

540
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,300
(He keeps raising his arm like he's
looking for a restaurant owner.)

541
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,270
Excuse me. I'd like to buy this.

542
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,070
Who...

543
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,000
Is there no one in charge of this?

544
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,170
(While he's desperately looking for
the owner of the store...)

545
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,470
Oh, my. What should I buy?

546
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,110
A long sleeve shirt in a solid color
like this would be nice.

547
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,240
I have nothing to wear
for my YouTube videos.

548
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,560
(In fact, he's in workout clothes
in most of his videos.)

549
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,530
Oh, these sweat pants
look so comfortable.

550
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,560
I can't have enough of them.

551
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,750
This is an extra large?

552
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,720
My, it's so nice.

553
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,960
(Jong Kook's only luxury,
buying black workout clothes)

554
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,830
Right? It looks really nice.

555
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,390
(He picked the black sweat pants.)

556
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,370
What? Oh, my.

557
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,930
It's very soft. I like it.

558
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,700
Soft pants. I like it.

559
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,740
It's nice.

560
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,880
Oh, it's a new product? Nice.

561
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,050
Oh, my. This one is made of
a different type of fabric.

562
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,180
- What are the differences?
- What's funny?

563
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,920
- It's different.
- I don't see any differences.

564
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,150
No, you're wrong.
It's different from the other pairs.

565
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,830
The color and the fabric
are different.

566
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,870
Right. It's made of
a different type of fabric.

567
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,390
Look at this one.
It's different too.

568
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,040
What's this? It's quite different
from the ones I saw.

569
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,900
Okay. I'll pick this one too.
Let's go.

570
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,610
(He picked four very different pairs
of pants.)

571
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,730
They're different from one another.

572
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,110
They're made of
different types of fabrics.

573
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,700
Let's go.

574
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,900
(All black pants are different
from one another.)

575
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,280
I can buy gold too, right?

576
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,320
(So Min can't seem to leave
the gold store.)

577
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,820
Right. I didn't think of that.

578
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,240
Look at that. I want that.
That's what I want.

579
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,120
Is there anything worth 300 dollars?
How much is this piggy?

580
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,590
It's worth over 300 dollars.

581
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,950
- I see. The smaller one too?
- Yes.

582
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,190
How much is the smallest piggy?

583
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,270
- It's 330 dollars.
- I see.

584
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,100
I guess there's nothing I can get
within 300 dollars.

585
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, my. I feel like I'm in paradise.

586
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,340
My goodness. It's so cute.

587
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,930
What should I do?

588
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,640
What should I do with this?
Should I just...

589
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,520
Shall I get one?
This cushion is so cute.

590
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,780
(She finds the cushions so cute.)

591
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,520
This one is so cute. It's a unicorn.

592
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,790
What should I do? It's so cute.

593
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,630
My, it's so cute.

594
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,420
It's so cute. What should I do?

595
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,890
How cute.

596
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,220
I'll keep this one
and give the rest away as gifts.

597
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,330
Did I pick too many of them?

598
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,960
Are they expensive?
I think they are.

599
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,990
I pick LEGO.

600
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,040
(Ji Hyo chose a LEGO product
that's around 260 dollars.)

601
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,310
Shall I pick up some beer too?

602
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,640
How nice. I wish I could live here.

603
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,120
(The scent of alcohol
relaxes her mind and body.)

604
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,750
These are so cute.

605
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,860
(She has an unusual taste
and finds beer cans cute.)

606
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,330
These cans are so cute.

607
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,600
Look at these cans.
Aren't they cute?

608
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,960
(To her,
beer cans are cuter than dolls.)

609
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,390
My little princess likes
sweet potatoes.

610
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,970
Pumpkin sweet potatoes.
Chestnut sweet potatoes. Found them.

611
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,000
(She picks vegetables for her dog
instead beer.)

612
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,110
(The vegetables that her dog likes)

613
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,170
I'm done.

614
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,640
(The vegetables that her dog likes)

615
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,410
I need to get a fish tank.
But how will I carry it?

616
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,410
(Haha said
he would get a fish tank earlier.)

617
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,890
I found fish tanks. Here they are.
Look at those fish tanks.

618
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,390
(It's a good chance for him
since he needed one.)

619
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,680
My, these all look nice.

620
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,290
Hold on. How do I get one?
How does it work?

621
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,680
Okay.

622
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,100
(He calls his wife Byul.)

623
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,690
- Honey, I'm shooting Running Man.
- Yes.

624
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,960
And I found a nice fish tank here.

625
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,640
- Oh, but I already ordered one.
- Did you?

626
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,280
Since it'll be delivered tomorrow,

627
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,740
it'd be great
if you pick up a heater...

628
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,280
and some ornaments.

629
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,620
Okay. Got it.

630
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,710
Then... A heater.

631
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,740
(He starts shopping
now that he got her approval.)

632
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,150
It's too cold for our pet turtles.

633
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,330
(Starting with a fish tank heater
for his cold turtles)

634
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,530
We also need a sturdy filter.

635
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,920
Filters are easily broken,
so I'll get two of them.

636
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,530
I'll get a rock too.

637
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,570
For the turtles to go up on it.

638
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,300
Oh, my.
The kids will love this, right?

639
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,160
I found a filter.

640
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,310
(A message from his wife arrived.)

641
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,780
"Soonsoo Signature Toilet Paper,
Huggies Soft Pants..."

642
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,470
She wants me to pick up diapers?

643
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,240
(While Haha received a request
for additional items...)

644
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,020
Oh, dear.

645
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,350
"Catch! Teenieping."

646
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,590
(Jae Suk is moving by himself.)

647
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,410
(His arms are full of gifts
for Na Eun.)

648
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,420
Oh, I should buy some books
for Ji Ho.

649
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,720
I think
I picked enough toys for Na Eun.

650
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,830
There aren't many toys
for kids around Ji Ho's age.

651
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,330
This is so uncomfortable.

652
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,530
(He has less than ten minutes left
to shop.)

653
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,660
(Jae Suk is left alone
as no one cares.)

654
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,660
Where are the other members?

655
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,110
They must be busy
choosing their own gifts.

656
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

657
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay. I'm done shopping.

658
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,340
Where is Jae Suk?

659
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,700
Jae Suk, where are you?

660
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,970
Jae Suk.

661
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,670
Hey, what is all that?

662
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,780
I didn't go down.

663
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,390
- I heard you came down.
- What did you get?

664
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,410
Pajamas.

665
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,480
(He picked gifts only for Na Eun
while he only got pajamas.)

666
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,790
Suk Jin, I didn't know
you wanted a hat like this.

667
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,950
No, this is for my mother.

668
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,130
- Really?
- Yes.

669
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,630
- Push the cart for me.
- Okay.

670
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,250
I mean, they all left me alone...
Oh, gosh.

671
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,530
Sit down.

672
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,530
(Seok Sam with no skills
drags the cart wildly.)

673
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,070
Suk Jin, that's not important.
I need to go that way.

674
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,730
(No, I need to go somewhere else.)

675
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,610
- No, I need to go somewhere else.
- Gosh.

676
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,900
- I want...
- I'm not going that way.

677
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,610
- Hey! Get back on the cart now!
- I mean...

678
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,340
- No, I need to go somewhere else.
- Gosh.

679
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,440
(Jae Suk's feet touched the floor.)

680
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,500
Get back on the cart now!

681
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,670
- I have no choice.
- Come on.

682
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,740
- Let's go.
- Oh, no.

683
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,440
(Oh, no.)

684
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,890
- What's with these stickers?
- Suk Jin.

685
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,950
- Na Eun likes them.
- Put your other foot on the cart.

686
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,890
- Then pick that up for me.
- Put the other foot on the cart.

687
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,720
- Put it on the cart.
- Why...

688
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,030
- Stay seated for a while.
- That's not the point.

689
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,490
- I'm sorry. I'll be back shortly.
- No. I need to...

690
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,370
(His feet touched the floor again.)

691
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,610
Let me look around just for a while.

692
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,500
(He takes small steps.)

693
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,780
- I need to go there.
- Gosh, seriously.

694
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,280
- What's wrong?
- Hey!

695
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,050
- Why are you running around?
- Help me...

696
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,640
- Get back on the cart.
- I wasn't running around.

697
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,820
I don't want to go that way.

698
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,050
Jae Suk,
hurry up and get on the cart.

699
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,520
Suk Jin tried to take me
to another aisle.

700
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,520
- I need to go there, So Min.
- I'll take you there.

701
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,060
- Oh, these must be for Na Eun.
- I haven't...

702
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,450
- All right. Let's go.
- I haven't picked a gift for Ji Ho.

703
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,720
- These are all for Na Eun, right?
- Yes.

704
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,750
- So Min, come here.
- I need to check that out.

705
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,390
- Suk Jin, come and take me there.
- Okay.

706
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,640
- How much time do we have left?
- While we were arguing,

707
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,040
we wasted so much time.

708
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,070
- Where do you want to go?
- That way.

709
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,540
- Just go. I'll walk there.
- No.

710
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,110
- Let's go there just for a second.
- No way.

711
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,470
- I just need to check this one out.
- Over there,

712
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,710
- I just need to see that.
- there are Bluetooth earphones.

713
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,970
- Then just go.
- Just one product. No.

714
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,050
I can't leave you alone.

715
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,290
- What is it? Let's take a look.
- Take me that way.

716
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,520
- Darn.
- What's this? Electronic target?

717
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,290
I want to find something for Ji Ho.

718
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,360
But I have to...

719
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,690
- I have to go to that aisle.
- Go. Hurry up.

720
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,370
This is 210 dollars?
It's 17 years old.

721
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,890
Hey, Se Chan, there you are.

722
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,430
I've been looking all over for you.
How much is that?

723
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,700
This is it. I'm done.

724
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,780
I should take that out.
So it's 200 dollars...

725
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,970
(He chose a bottle of whiskey
instead of daily necessities.)

726
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,110
I'll return these two.

727
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,520
Oh, no.
My precious windshield wiper fluids.

728
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,410
(He returns
the windshield wiper fluids too.)

729
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,480
Done.

730
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,950
I've been meaning to buy that.

731
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,090
Oh, my. He chose his stuff
very carefully.

732
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,750
- Should I put them in a box?
- A box?

733
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,450
- Yes, I'll put them in a box.
- Okay.

734
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,920
Oh, my. What did you buy?

735
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,960
- LEGO?
- Yes.

736
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,340
- Will you do it by yourself?
- Yes.

737
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,690
I'm not sure about the total price.

738
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,080
(He got four completely different
pairs of pants.)

739
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,110
(The things that Jong Kook
and Suk Jin purchased)

740
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,240
- It's 144.30 dollars.
- Yes. Here you go.

741
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,620
Hello.

742
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,710
I have to buy things
that are worth 300 dollars in total.

743
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,910
- Yes.
- You only picked toys and stickers.

744
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,560
- How much is it?
- Give me a moment, please.

745
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,290
It's 234.97 dollars.

746
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,890
- Then 70 dollars are left.
- You have 70 dollars left.

747
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,180
Okay. Then that's all for me.

748
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,250
Let's get going.

749
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,490
- He can move around by himself now.
- Indeed.

750
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,660
- He's a master now.
- Thank you.

751
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,370
You can move around by yourself.

752
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,930
Kyung Eun will probably give me
an earful.

753
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,000
He bought a lot of toys.

754
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
- Probably.
- She'll say I bought too many toys.

755
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,380
- Yes, she will.
- That's all worth 230 dollars?

756
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,380
- Really?
- This is worth 230 dollars.

757
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,700
- I'm like Santa Claus.
- Oh, my.

758
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,500
- Se Chan, can you help me?
- Sure. What do you need?

759
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,380
- Can you put them in this?
- Okay.

760
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,380
I'll give it to you later.

761
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,550
Why would she...
So Min bought a suitcase.

762
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,390
- Se Chan, put them in this...
- How much is it?

763
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,410
- It's a little over 130 dollars.
- I'm like Santa Claus.

764
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,680
- Yes. I'll give you.
- Just a moment, please.

765
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,650
- My gosh. What's this?
- I don't know if I can afford it.

766
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,720
I need to think about it.

767
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,300
- Why would she buy so many dolls?
- Why would she buy so many dolls?

768
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,660
We said the same thing
at the same time.

769
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,800
- That's funny.
- Why would she buy so many dolls?

770
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,310
I mean,
she has to carry them around.

771
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,110
How sweet.
Her boyfriend is helping her.

772
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,700
- He's doing all the work for her.
- Right.

773
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,880
That's because it's hers.
It's her suitcase.

774
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
I know.

775
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,320
- So Min.
- Yes?

776
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,280
I don't want to criticize you
for what you bought, but...

777
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,910
I mean,
why did you buy strawberries?

778
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,640
- Why did you buy this?
- Why strawberries?

779
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,250
Is this a bag?

780
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,390
- Her boyfriend is so nice.
- Right.

781
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,130
- We'll get going now.
- Shall we?

782
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,830
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

783
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,660
You bought all you needed, right?

784
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

785
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,490
- Now, I'll tell you the real rules.
- What?

786
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,430
Today's race is actually...

787
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,930
the Christmas special,
Santa Yoo and Six Rudolphs.

788
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,240
- Santa Yoo?
- The things you just purchased...

789
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,940
are actually Christmas gifts for citizens,
not for you guys.

790
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,850
- That'll warm our hearts.
- Those are Christmas gifts...

791
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,620
(Haha will have to give citizens
the fish tank items as gifts.)

792
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,860
- I have to order everything again.
- But...

793
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,390
This is...

794
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,450
Hold on. I canceled
all my same-day delivery orders.

795
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,100
(Oh, dear)

796
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,190
- No way.
- This is...

797
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,930
- Excuse me.
- I picked what my kids would like.

798
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,640
- Come on. I bought pajamas.
- I have...

799
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,460
- a gift for the cameraman.
- My gosh.

800
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,700
- I can't believe this.
- I mean...

801
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,640
I don't know who will receive this,
but today it's their lucky day.

802
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,040
- They are so lucky.
- But...

803
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,900
- I feel the same way.
- She even bought a suitcase.

804
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,640
(She'll have to give away the food
in the suitcase as well.)

805
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,820
- I mean, hey.
- My gosh.

806
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,910
It's so disappointing.

807
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,710
Since you chose those gifts
after much thought,

808
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,820
I'm sure that citizens will be
very happy to receive them.

809
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,410
Yes, of course.
I chose all of them carefully.

810
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,180
You will visit several places
with a Christmas vibe...

811
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,150
and carry out missions
with the citizens you meet.

812
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,560
Every time you fail,

813
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,160
the number of gifts you can give
to the citizens will decrease.

814
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,190
- So please do your best.
- We must complete the missions.

815
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,540
We should do our best
to give away all the gifts we have.

816
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,810
Like earlier, Santa Yoo must
keep his feet off the ground.

817
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:21,170
- Suk Jin and I argued earlier.
- Right.

818
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,640
- He tried to take me elsewhere...
- It wasn't like that.

819
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,210
- You guys caused a ruckus.
- Yes, we did.

820
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,640
- Let me explain.
- I saw Jae Suk running around.

821
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,740
- How many steps?
- I didn't run around.

822
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,650
- He ran around for so long. Yes.
- He ran around?

823
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,620
It's been moved to 7:30 a.m.

824
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,830
- Did you say 7:30 a.m.?
- Yes.

825
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,920
That's too early.

826
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,890
At this rate, we might have to...

827
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,150
- do the opening at 4 a.m.
- That's the worst.

828
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,890
We'll move to the location
for the first mission.

829
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Okay!

830
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,430
No one will like my gifts.
I only bought black pants.

831
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,490
- Hop on my back.
- Gosh.

832
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,700
This is it.

833
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,900
What? A treadmill?

834
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,110
- What's going on?
- Why is a treadmill here?

835
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,310
(A treadmill is placed
in the middle of the mall.)

836
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,550
What's this treadmill for?

837
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,550
What's that?

838
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,380
The first mission is...

839
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,180
- Santa Rides A Treadmill.
- Jae Suk, be careful.

840
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,910
- A treadmill?
- Santa Rides A Treadmill.

841
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,590
You have to invite two citizens.
Nine people in total...

842
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,890
- have to work together.
- Got it.

843
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,190
Each must run on the treadmill
for one minute...

844
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,100
and read the given text
in one breath.

845
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,070
- Gosh. That sounds hard.
- When you're out of breath,

846
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,990
the next player will run
on the treadmill...

847
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,890
and read the rest of the text
starting with the next word.

848
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,870
- It won't be easy.
- That's...

849
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,400
If you read through to the end,
you succeed.

850
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,000
If you succeed on your first try,
you can give away all your gifts.

851
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,940
Every time you fail,
you will lose two gifts.

852
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,410
- Two gifts?
- Yes.

853
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,290
We'll randomly choose the gifts...

854
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,150
- to take away.
- Understood.

855
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,530
Santa Yoo is allowed to put his feet
on the ground when his turn comes.

856
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,590
I see. Okay.

857
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,300
Now, go and find two citizens
who will help you with the mission.

858
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,190
- Two citizens.
- Physical ability is important.

859
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,630
How about those who are watching us
from the Pilates center?

860
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,070
- Pilates?
- They exercise on a regular basis.

861
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,070
- They exercise...
- Se Chan is going there.

862
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,900
- Se Chan is going there.
- There he goes.

863
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,460
- Go, Se Chan.
- You can do it, Se Chan.

864
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,610
Namaste.

865
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,310
- "Namaste?"
- They don't say that.

866
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,050
- That's for a yoga class.
- Exactly.

867
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,670
- He became so active suddenly.
- Those exercises are similar. Yes.

868
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,670
- That's nice.
- Shall I go?

869
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,440
There's a gym over there.
Ji Hyo, you go to the gym.

870
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,290
- Me?
- Invite one of the trainers there.

871
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,680
- Lately, Ji Hyo is...
- Yes.

872
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,150
- She's the casting queen.
- so good at casting.

873
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,360
- Exactly.
- There she goes. Ji Hyo is going.

874
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,390
(Chuckling)

875
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,190
- Did they refuse to come?
- I got scolded.

876
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,100
- Why?
- They said they couldn't do it.

877
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,460
- They scolded me as they refused.
- You...

878
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,270
Did they refuse to come
because of your appearance?

879
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,400
I think so.

880
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,110
- Do you want to go with me?
- Yes. Let's go.

881
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,200
Okay. Let's go.

882
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,240
- You see...
- Jae Suk...

883
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,740
- can be very persuasive.
- Hey, don't leave Jae Suk alone.

884
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,940
Stay with him.

885
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,940
- Gosh.
- Oh, there's... No.

886
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,050
Hey.

887
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,520
- Gosh.
- Oh, there's... No.

888
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,560
Hey.

889
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,390
Your feet touched the floor
three times.

890
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,060
- We'll move it up by 30 minutes.
- What did you do?

891
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,250
- The starting time is 7 a.m. now.
- It's dangerous.

892
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,890
- Just stay here, Jae Suk.
- But...

893
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,300
- Stay here, Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk...

894
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,920
- I think...
- That cord...

895
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,840
- Stay seated.
- I'll stay seated.

896
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,660
I thought we could go over it.

897
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,900
- Gosh. I can't believe this.
- That was... My gosh.

898
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,580
- Do you run often?
- Yes.

899
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,780
That's great. I'm relieved.

900
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,850
- Hello.
- Hello. Are you busy?

901
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,120
- Are you busy right now?
- Not at all.

902
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,820
- Can you help us with a mission?
- Sure.

903
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,320
- Great. Are you good at running?
- Thank you.

904
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,680
Do you often run on a treadmill?

905
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,820
- I saw the young ones over there.
- Yes.

906
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,480
- Young ones?
- Hey, young lads.

907
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,980
- We're back.
- Good job, young lads.

908
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,360
- That's funny.
- We brought one person.

909
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,600
- That's right. He's here.
- Hey, young lad.

910
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,390
- It's good that he's young.
- He doesn't look so young.

911
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,830
I don't think he's so young.

912
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,640
- How old are you?
- I'm 38.

913
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,370
- Oh, he's 38.
- See? I knew it.

914
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,370
He's 38.

915
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,900
- But you're much younger than me.
- He was born in 1985.

916
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,900
- Hey...
- I'm 44. I'm much older than him.

917
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,000
He's being bossy again.

918
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,880
- He's so bossy, indeed.
- Indeed.

919
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

920
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,210
- Welcome.
- I work there.

921
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,740
- Oh, you just came to work?
- It's nice to meet you.

922
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,440
He has a muscular body as expected.

923
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,750
- Are you...
- It's nice to meet you.

924
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,090
- Likewise.
- Are you subscribed to his channel?

925
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,090
- Yes, Gym Jong Kook.
- Mr. Trainer.

926
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,560
- I watched every video. I'm a fan.
- Gym Jong Kook.

927
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,690
- Is he a fitness trainer?
- He represents all trainers.

928
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,100
- Oh, my.
- He looks like...

929
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,540
a soccer player
looking at Lionel Messi.

930
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,840
- That's a good comparison.
- How do trainers...

931
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,570
What do fitness trainers
think of Jong Kook?

932
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,040
He's like Lionel Messi.

933
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,500
- Lionel Messi.
- Oh, my.

934
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,080
Thank you so much.

935
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,850
- He's the father of fitness.
- He must be a huge fan.

936
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,670
- The father of fitness?
- He's the father of fitness.

937
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,020
- I'm so grateful.
- The Bang Jeong Hwan in that field.

938
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,120
Fitness trainers are...

939
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,520
- really amazing.
- Of course.

940
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,090
You said you came to work.
Where do you work?

941
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,590
I work in the store over there.

942
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,950
- Oh, I see.
- He works here.

943
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,090
- It's good that you two came.
- Yes.

944
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,420
- We prepared gifts for you.
- Yes. We'll give you a gift.

945
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,990
- We prepared really nice gifts.
- Thank you for joining us.

946
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,800
- If you receive Jae Suk's gifts,
- I should've bought them.

947
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,930
- you'll be very happy.
- Absolutely.

948
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,430
Do you like "Catch! Teenieping?"

949
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,990
- Pardon?
- "Catch! Teenieping."

950
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,810
It's very popular.

951
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,400
You have to decide
on the order first.

952
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,670
When it's your turn,
run on the treadmill...

953
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,550
and read the text here
right after running.

954
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,670
- Got it.
- Okay.

955
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,440
- Let's go! We've got this.
- Let's go.

956
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,670
- Let's do this.
- Now...

957
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,240
- Seok Sam, you go first.
- All right. I'll do that.

958
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,290
- Suk Jin.
- Listen, everyone.

959
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,860
- I'll read the whole thing.
- Go, Suk Jin.

960
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,680
- Let's do this.
- Seok Sam.

961
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,450
- Go up, and we'll set the speed.
- Okay. Go on, Suk Jin.

962
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,920
- Okay.
- Seok Sam.

963
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,990
Here I go. I've got this!

964
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,630
Show them how healthy you are.

965
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,390
- Right. Show them.
- Of course. I'm very healthy.

966
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,990
Show them
how healthy and vigorous you are.

967
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,070
I'll do that.

968
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,070
(The vigorous man is confident.)

969
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,080
Okay. How fast will it be?

970
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,640
- That's too fast.
- How fast...

971
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
- What?
- It'll be 15km per hour.

972
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,200
Did you say 15km per hour? Hey!

973
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,380
- Did she say 15km per hour?
- You can do it.

974
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,020
- My gosh.
- It'll be hard.

975
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,210
It's so fast.

976
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,940
- Start.
- Gosh.

977
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,210
- Oh, my. It's so fast.
- Gosh, that's...

978
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,710
- How many seconds have passed?
- Do you think we can do it?

979
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,680
- It has begun.
- I played soccer yesterday.

980
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,590
- We'll get hurt if we fall.
- This is no joke.

981
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,390
- We should be careful.
- How much longer should I run?

982
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,190
How much time has passed?

983
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,190
Twenty-six.
I have to run for one minute?

984
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,390
- It's fast.
- Fifteen seconds have passed.

985
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,270
Seok Sam, are you okay?

986
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,270
(Stiff)

987
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,400
- You look worried.
- No, I'm not worried.

988
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,200
Do you exercise often?

989
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,310
- Well... Not that often.
- I see.

990
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,880
- How many seconds have passed?
- So Min is up next.

991
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,670
(He's practically hanging
on the treadmill.)

992
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,120
Okay. You're almost done.

993
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,240
You should hold the bars
while running.

994
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,120
- How much longer?
- Almost there.

995
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,360
It's fast.

996
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,890
(One minute has passed.
The treadmill stops.)

997
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,060
You can come down
and read the text now.

998
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,890
(The sentences
that they have to read out loud)

999
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,990
- Ready. Go.
- Go now.

1000
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,660
- In one breath.
- Ready. Go.

1001
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,310
- "2022..."
- Gosh.

1002
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,610
- Suk Jin.
- Ready. Go.

1003
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,100
(2022...)

1004
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,400
- Come on.
- My gosh.

1005
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,150
What's wrong with him?

1006
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,940
- I'm sorry.
- What was that?

1007
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,520
- I'm sorry, but...
- What's wrong with you?

1008
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,750
- Suk Jin, you're a pro.
- He did his best.

1009
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,120
- Let me explain.
- You're a pro.

1010
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,210
That ended so quickly.

1011
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
Listen to me.

1012
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,750
You should know
that I'm not joking around.

1013
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,900
- Gosh. Then next...
- Who goes next?

1014
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,500
Should we begin after "2022?"

1015
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,830
Yes, right after "2022."

1016
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,000
Can you mark the word?

1017
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,440
Who's up next? So Min?

1018
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,100
- It's after "2022."
- I'm not sure if I can do this.

1019
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,210
- Start after that.
- The weak ones go first, right?

1020
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,770
It's better if I go next
because I'm not good at it, right?

1021
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,230
- I just ran,
- So Min.

1022
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,400
and I barely read one word.

1023
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
We'll set the speed to 13km per hour
for female members.

1024
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,250
- To 13km per hour?
- So Min.

1025
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,620
- Hold the bars while running.
- Or else, I'll fall, right?

1026
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:06,870
For now...

1027
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,940
For now...

1028
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,690
- Seriously, I'm not...
- What is she doing?

1029
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,790
You can hold the bars while running.

1030
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,920
Hold the bars while running.

1031
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,690
- Right. Or else, you might fall.
- Okay.

1032
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,460
(Screaming)

1033
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,900
- Gosh, it's too fast!
- She's not running properly.

1034
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,520
- So Min isn't running properly.
- Why are you stomping on it?

1035
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,620
- Hold the bars.
- Hold the bars. It's dangerous.

1036
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,330
I can tell
that she's never run before.

1037
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,060
She hasn't done any running before.

1038
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,640
The sole of her feet. Right?

1039
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,400
So Min hasn't done
any running before.

1040
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,310
- She's stomping the soles.
- This might kill her.

1041
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,770
- She might die.
- Grab the handrail.

1042
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,080
- This seems like a challenge.
- Absolutely.

1043
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,270
- This looks hard.
- This isn't easy.

1044
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,850
- My gosh.
- So Min.

1045
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,540
Hang in there.

1046
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,210
(So Min's running has them
assuming a negative result.)

1047
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,920
Five, four...

1048
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,790
One. You're done. Stop it yourself.

1049
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,120
Go, So Min.

1050
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,500
- To the side.
- Step on it.

1051
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,290
- So Min, go ahead.
- Step down.

1052
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,460
"Is coming to an end."

1053
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,960
"Around this time of year,
a song is brought to our ears."

1054
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,440
"It's the carol White Christmas."

1055
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,870
"It means a snowy Christmas..."

1056
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,270
"and this song made in the US
became the first popular carol."

1057
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,560
- Gosh.
- No way.

1058
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,400
"And this song made in the US
became the first popular carol."

1059
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,730
(So Min's did quite well.)

1060
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,310
- Nice.
- You should've taken...

1061
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,770
- a big breath first. Did you?
- Did you take a breath?

1062
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,710
- There wasn't time for that.
- Gosh.

1063
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,670
She did really well
which means I was terrible at it.

1064
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,480
So Min did a great job.

1065
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,690
- You did really well.
- Good job, So Min.

1066
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,120
This is the game she's the best at.

1067
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,290
- Dong Hyub.
- Yes?

1068
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,080
- Will you be all right?
- Sure.

1069
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,960
You'll be reading from...

1070
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,750
- "The romantic mood of the snow."
- Sure.

1071
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,960
If he hasn't worked out before...

1072
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,170
Judging by his legs,
I doubt that he has.

1073
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,900
It doesn't look like
he's been working out.

1074
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
Will he be all right?

1075
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,960
Be careful.

1076
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,580
Please be careful
and grab the handrail.

1077
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,770
- Wait.
- Hold on a second.

1078
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,440
Dong Hyub.

1079
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,310
Hold on a second.

1080
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,520
Dong Hyub.

1081
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,540
He hasn't done any running before.

1082
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,210
- Yes?
- Are you all right?

1083
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,020
Please grab the handrail.

1084
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,650
Dong Hyub, my gosh.

1085
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,890
He...

1086
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,190
It's like he's running like this.

1087
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,060
His legs have lost their way.

1088
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,230
- His legs have lost their way.
- Are you all right?

1089
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,830
It's like he's running like this.

1090
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,940
- Dong Hyub, are you all right?
- Yes.

1091
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,230
He's flustered.

1092
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,400
Have you tried running for a minute
any time recently?

1093
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,170
- Yes, I have.
- Really?

1094
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,640
It doesn't seem that way.

1095
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,310
Please be careful.

1096
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,400
- Please be careful.
- You'll trip.

1097
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,440
Please be careful.

1098
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,370
- Call an ambulance.
- Don't try to look cool.

1099
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,710
- Don't try to look cool.
- Don't be flustered.

1100
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,890
You can do this.

1101
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,210
- Five, four...
- He could have good lung function.

1102
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,750
Three, two, one.

1103
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,810
- Stop.
- Stop the treadmill for him.

1104
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,830
- Step to the side.
- Stop the treadmill.

1105
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,420
- Stop.
- Step on it.

1106
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,830
- All right.
- Ready, get set,

1107
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,290
- go.
- Take a deep breath.

1108
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,420
"The romantic mood of the snow
fits the song..."

1109
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,190
"which is why many enjoy
singing it or listening to it."

1110
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,600
"Singing it or listening to it."

1111
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,270
(Singing it or listening to it.)

1112
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,270
How lackluster was that?

1113
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,850
"Gosh, they sing the song."

1114
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,900
- You did well.
- Good job.

1115
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,920
- That was great.
- Dong Hyub, you did great.

1116
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,120
- "Singing it or listening to it."
- To it.

1117
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,210
(They're having
the time of their lives.)

1118
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,060
"Singing it or listening to it."

1119
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,460
He did great though. Meanwhile, I...

1120
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,960
- Jae Suk, why don't you go next?
- Maybe I should.

1121
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,290
- You have good stamina.
- Jae Suk, go next.

1122
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,350
Let's do this.

1123
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,730
To be honest,
I got dizzy after I stepped down.

1124
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,920
- Three of you need to finish this.
- So, I...

1125
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,370
Can you stop fishing
for compliments?

1126
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,400
- Want to go again?
- You did well.

1127
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,600
- How many times must I say it?
- I said I got dizzy.

1128
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,170
- The compliments weren't enough.
- It's not like that.

1129
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,330
You want more.

1130
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,580
It's not like that.
I just want you to listen to me.

1131
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,350
- Even though you were dizzy...
- Gosh.

1132
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,370
All right.

1133
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,580
(Fitness fanatic Jae Suk
gives it a try.)

1134
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,980
I should've tied
my shoelaces tighter.

1135
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,890
You can grab onto the handrails.

1136
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,810
He's as light as a feather.

1137
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,810
He must've been dying to run.

1138
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,980
Bring it on!

1139
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,890
He's loving it.

1140
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,500
- This is great.
- He has done some running before.

1141
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,600
You definitely know how to run.

1142
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,730
Does it show?

1143
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,640
- This is bad.
- What is it?

1144
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,830
I want to pee.

1145
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,140
(The sudden stimulation
has his bladder sending a signal.)

1146
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,580
- Unbelievable.
- Just like that?

1147
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,310
- He's fit except for his prostate.
- Hold the handrail if you want.

1148
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,100
- I haven't been to the restroom.
- You can grab onto it.

1149
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,210
All right. Five,

1150
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,790
four, three, two, one.
Press the button.

1151
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,980
One. Press the button.

1152
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,810
- Stop the treadmill.
- Take a deep breath.

1153
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,460
- I should've taken a breath too.
- Ready, go.

1154
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,120
"This song of four verses
is set in a lyrical mood..."

1155
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,190
"and is loved by everyone..."

1156
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,290
"regardless of age, gender,
nationality, and religion."

1157
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,560
"White Christmas was composed..."

1158
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,830
"for the musical film
Holiday Inn..."

1159
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,040
- That was close.
- Good job.

1160
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,060
- Okay.
- Jae Suk, that was great!

1161
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,870
- I should've...
- There's not much left.

1162
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,600
- Nice.
- Because I went first,

1163
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,640
I was clueless.

1164
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,230
Exactly. Suk Jin shouldn't have...

1165
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,500
- I should've been prepared.
- Let's do this.

1166
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,810
It's all because I went first.

1167
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,210
Can I go to the restroom?

1168
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,480
- Sure, go ahead.
- Suk Jin...

1169
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,850
Your feet can't touch
the ground though.

1170
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:38,890
What?

1171
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,390
My feet can't touch the ground
when I'm going to the toilet?

1172
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,730
- Should I take him?
- Then...

1173
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,230
How am I supposed to relieve myself?

1174
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,790
You need to get it done
while seated.

1175
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,500
Maybe you can turn around.

1176
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,330
Place him on the toilet.

1177
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,600
- You need to pull your pants up.
- Why is a cameraman coming with us?

1178
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,940
Why are you filming me
when I'm off to the restroom?

1179
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,670
Ji Yeon, go away.

1180
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,270
(The cameraman and director
are professionals.)

1181
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,540
I couldn't see anything at first.

1182
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,370
- That's how dizzy I was.
- But you still did a good job.

1183
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,480
I don't mean that, you jerk.

1184
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,690
You want more compliments.
I know I'm right.

1185
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,850
The compliments earlier
weren't enough.

1186
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,790
- I'm telling you how it was.
- You're... Fine.

1187
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,520
- I didn't mean it like that.
- We complimented her,

1188
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,580
- but she's fishing for more.
- That's not it.

1189
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,120
- I'm saying it was hard.
- How much will be enough?

1190
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,960
How far do you need us to go?

1191
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,670
Did they film you taking a leak?

1192
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,400
It was done quite stably.

1193
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,000
- Really?
- He did it from up here.

1194
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,060
From higher ground?

1195
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,310
While standing on it?

1196
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,900
He got a taste of what it's like
to be Seo Jang Hoon.

1197
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,330
We'll now move on to Haha...

1198
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,270
- who is the fifth runner.
- Good luck.

1199
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,350
- Okay.
- Nice.

1200
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,770
- Good.
- Go, Haha.

1201
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,670
- This is really fast.
- It is.

1202
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,850
"It was written for the movie."

1203
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,810
"The Russian American musician
Irving Berlin wrote it..."

1204
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,350
"while dreaming of
the hot desert state of Arizona..."

1205
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,520
(His legs are short,
but he managed to say two lines.)

1206
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,620
- Good job.
- You looked great, Haha.

1207
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,390
Will Ji Hyo be okay in her dress?

1208
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,900
I'm more worried about my shoes.

1209
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,690
Your shoes don't seem appropriate.

1210
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,770
- My shoes.
- Will they be okay?

1211
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,120
- Are the shoes okay?
- Yes.

1212
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,690
The fitness trainer can go next.

1213
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,770
- This can be done.
- It should be a ten.

1214
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,370
- Does it need to be at 12?
- No, 13.

1215
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,770
- It's one paragraph.
- Look at Ji Hyo run.

1216
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,310
She's quite the runner.

1217
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,540
- Her running seems stable.
- She's light on her feet.

1218
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,620
My shoes.

1219
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,250
I told you to change shoes.

1220
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,460
My shoes, darn it.

1221
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,790
- My shoes, darn it.
- Forty seconds.

1222
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,120
What did she just say?

1223
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,520
Her shoes? That startled me.

1224
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,060
- Three, two.
- Hold the handrail.

1225
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,460
One, and you're done. Come down.

1226
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,600
(A minute passed
while she got angry with her shoes.)

1227
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,900
You'll do it right away. And go.

1228
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,060
"Covered in snow on Christmas."

1229
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,540
"It is said that Bing Crosby
made it a Christmas classic."

1230
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,270
Good.

1231
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,040
- Good job.
- You did well.

1232
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,250
Okay, good.

1233
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,370
- It's not bad.
- We're doing great.

1234
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,750
The trainer's next.

1235
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,790
- Don't you need sneakers?
- No, these are fine.

1236
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,350
The trainer will probably read
all that is left.

1237
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,020
Jong Kook,
I doubt you'll get your turn.

1238
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,290
- He'll complete the mission for us.
- Nice.

1239
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,980
Get ready.

1240
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,190
- We...
- Hold on.

1241
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,000
Suk Jin didn't do anything
to help us out.

1242
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,900
It was as if
I didn't participate but...

1243
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,610
And he's off.

1244
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,280
Jong Kook,
I doubt you'll get your turn.

1245
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,410
His feet are light.

1246
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,740
That's what I'm talking about.
His running is different from ours.

1247
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,650
He keeps his mouth shut.

1248
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,110
- He just breathes through his nose.
- Right.

1249
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,680
He must not be out of breath.

1250
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,450
He might be able
to run for two hours.

1251
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,450
- Five, four.
- Four.

1252
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,030
- Three, two, one.
- You can step down.

1253
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,160
- Nice.
- Stop the treadmill.

1254
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,630
This is great.

1255
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,760
- Take a deep breath.
- Ready, get set, go.

1256
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,070
"Many adore his version the most..."

1257
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,970
"due to his deep masculine voice
that warms the heart."

1258
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,780
"His version of White Christmas..."

1259
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,910
- Gosh.
- What?

1260
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,410
(Stops to take a breath)

1261
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,910
- Did he take a breath?
- What on earth?

1262
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,320
- That's fine though.
- It sounded so lifeless.

1263
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,410
- It sounded soulless.
- Jang Dong Min!

1264
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,340
(The Jang Dong Min of Yeongdeungpo
couldn't hold his breath.)

1265
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,680
- Did you hear his tone?
- His running was on point.

1266
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,050
- I should've read some more.
- Se Chan could finish this.

1267
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,160
Okay.

1268
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,130
- Se Chan, end it for us.
- Go, Ssaebssaeb.

1269
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,320
There's no need for me to run too.

1270
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,530
Se Chan's the worst
at reading though.

1271
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,900
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1272
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,400
That could be an issue.

1273
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,340
Hold on. So Min, look.

1274
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,840
- Doesn't this impress you?
- You look good, Se Chan!

1275
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,470
- Doesn't he look cool?
- You're so handsome!

1276
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,010
How manly of you.

1277
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,380
- Right.
- Here we go.

1278
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,070
Five, four, three,

1279
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,050
two, one. Stop.

1280
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,340
- Okay.
- Ready, get set, go.

1281
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,340
"Became the top-selling single
of all time..."

1282
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,660
"earning it a spot
on the 2008 Guinness World Records."

1283
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,090
(Mission complete)

1284
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,490
- Gosh.
- Okay!

1285
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,680
- Good.
- Nicely done.

1286
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,630
- All right.
- Jong Kook didn't have to compete.

1287
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,720
- Okay!
- Nice.

1288
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,930
You can count Suk Jin out too.

1289
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,490
We managed it without
having me or Suk Jin compete.

1290
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,910
It's all thanks to So Min.
She won it for us.

1291
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,570
So Min, you did so well.

1292
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,030
- You were incredible.
- Nicely done.

1293
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,570
- It's not gratifying though.
- Thanks, So Min.

1294
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,800
I'm not too happy with that.

1295
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,410
You managed it on your first try,

1296
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,970
so no presents will get taken away.

1297
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,410
(No presents will be taken away.)

1298
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,590
How will we give out the gifts?

1299
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,650
The citizens
who participated in the mission...

1300
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,720
will receive the presents
that you chose.

1301
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,510
Please pick out a number.

1302
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,160
- The numbers...
- Please step forward.

1303
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,050
There are a lot of presents...

1304
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,990
that will be worth taking home.

1305
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,530
- There's...
- There's alcohol.

1306
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,490
- Alcohol?
- One that's worth 270 dollars.

1307
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,740
It's whiskey, right?

1308
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,240
That's right.
One of them is whiskey.

1309
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,470
It'd be amazing if you get it.

1310
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,860
- Do you have a child?
- Yes.

1311
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,860
Well, then...

1312
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,510
- Do you have a daughter?
- Yes.

1313
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,430
- There are many items for her.
- It's perfect.

1314
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,680
- We got many gifts for children.
- Jae Suk's is...

1315
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,010
Is it a raffle?

1316
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,950
- Here we go.
- Let's go for it.

1317
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,110
- That's how they draw it.
- Okay.

1318
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,280
- There's a lot.
- Pick one each.

1319
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,510
- Pick one each.
- Pick one each.

1320
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,380
- I hope they get good ones.
- If they get Royal Salute...

1321
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,380
It's 27.

1322
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,050
- Nice.
- Mine is good as well.

1323
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,220
(What will they choose
out of 46 gifts?)

1324
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,930
- What's the number?
- It's 31.

1325
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,530
- It's 31.
- It's 31.

1326
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,430
Give us gift number 31.

1327
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,490
- Number 31.
- Number 31 is...

1328
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,160
a dog plushie So Min got.

1329
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,430
Thank you.

1330
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,300
(The first gift is quite cute.)

1331
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,700
(Thank you.)

1332
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,570
- It's for your daughter.
- Yes.

1333
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,780
- You can give it to your child.
- There's a handle on the back.

1334
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,780
That's cute.

1335
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,280
Put it...

1336
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,280
- Thank you.
- next to your child...

1337
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,410
on the bed to keep her from falling.

1338
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,550
So that she won't fall.

1339
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,680
Wash it before giving it to her.

1340
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,280
Now, the gym trainer.

1341
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,660
- I got 26.
- It's 26.

1342
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,180
Okay. Number 26.

1343
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,550
What is it?

1344
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,220
Congratulations. You'll get two
volumes of comic books Jae Suk got.

1345
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,300
(Jae Suk's
2 volumes of comic books)

1346
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,240
- Thank you.
- It's...

1347
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,840
- I like comic books.
- It's what Ji Ho likes.

1348
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,360
Ji Ho likes this.

1349
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,930
- Take a selfie with me,
- Okay.

1350
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,510
holding the books.

1351
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,050
I have a nephew.

1352
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,240
- He'd like it.
- Yes.

1353
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,280
He's still eight months old.

1354
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,570
If he's eight months old...

1355
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1356
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,860
Thank you.

1357
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,320
- It's a nice gift for a child.
- Let's take a photo quickly.

1358
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,050
You might start feeling hungry now.

1359
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,760
- Yes.
- Let's go and eat.

1360
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,990
- Okay.
- All right.

1361
00:45:58,990 --> 00:45:59,990
Where are we going?

1362
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,260
- We're there.
- Okay.

1363
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,820
Be careful not to let
his feet touch the ground.

1364
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,470
- Oh, right.
- Oh, right.

1365
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,800
I got it.

1366
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,240
All right.

1367
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,410
(Ji-dolph is here in Yeouido.)

1368
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,570
Come out.

1369
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,070
Yes, I'm Ji Suk Jin.

1370
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:20,150
- Oh, my gosh.
- Be happy.

1371
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,950
- Can I take a picture?
- Sure.

1372
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,320
- My goodness.
- Yes. A peace sign.

1373
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,760
- Hello.
- Oh, my gosh.

1374
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,780
My goodness.

1375
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,950
- Oh, gosh.
- Do we have to take out the gifts?

1376
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,380
- Yes.
- We should carry them on our backs.

1377
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,700
Wait.
We should take out the gifts too.

1378
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,800
Let's go.

1379
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,430
Guys, this is Jong Kook.

1380
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,840
(Making a fuss)

1381
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,260
Jae Suk.

1382
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,130
- Jae Suk is getting off.
- Guys, Jae Suk is here.

1383
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,110
- Hi.
- Hello.

1384
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,950
You say something nice to them.

1385
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,010
What nice thing?

1386
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,410
- Are you sick?
- Hello.

1387
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,680
- No, I'm not sick.
- It's a mission.

1388
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,110
- It's a mission.
- It's a mission.

1389
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,550
She asked me if I was sick.

1390
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,990
Merry Christmas.

1391
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,780
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1392
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,130
- Let's go.
- We should go.

1393
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,490
- Bye.
- Take care.

1394
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,160
- Bye.
- Bye.

1395
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,130
This is a hotel.

1396
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,800
You're right.

1397
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,510
- Yes.
- For hungry Santa and Rudolphs,

1398
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:20,240
- It's done.
- we prepared a fancy hotel buffet.

1399
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,380
Jae Suk.

1400
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,180
- Yes.
- You should eat what we give you.

1401
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,410
Right. You should give me the food.

1402
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,550
- I want to walk.
- It's great many people like us.

1403
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,280
This is the best buffet...

1404
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,820
that is fully booked
during the Christmas season.

1405
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:33,950
(It's filled with various delicacies
the members like.)

1406
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:36,030
Hotels have the best Christmas vibes
as expected.

1407
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,550
Yes. Hotels are the best.

1408
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,630
- I love this kind of buffet.
- I've never been here.

1409
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,300
I've never been to this place.

1410
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,030
This is nice.

1411
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,400
So Min, let's have snow crabs.

1412
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,030
It sounds good. There's salmon.

1413
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,430
Oh, my.

1414
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,930
Where should we let Jae Suk sit?
Let him sit here.

1415
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,510
- Santa.
- This place is so nice.

1416
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,680
Jong Kook carried him.

1417
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,110
- This is great.
- Good job, Jong Kook.

1418
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,180
No worries.

1419
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,650
Precious Jae Suk...

1420
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:58,880
Jong Kook must be sweating now.

1421
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,490
It's good for both. You don't have
to walk and you get to exercise.

1422
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,510
The one who is carrying is tired,
but the one who is carried is...

1423
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,550
- Right. It's tiring.
- You should strain your body.

1424
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,550
- I should strain my arms.
- It's tiring.

1425
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,630
- It's very tiring.
- It's tiring.

1426
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,180
You can forget
about the mission here.

1427
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,090
As long as your feet
don't touch the ground.

1428
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,550
You can enjoy it freely.

1429
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,490
- You told me to forget.
- We'll get the food for you.

1430
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,400
- We'll get what you want.
- All right.

1431
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,990
- We know what you like.
- Don't get too much food.

1432
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,110
- Ssaebssaeb, you know what I like.
- Yes, I know.

1433
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,610
- A little bit of many things.
- A little bit of many things.

1434
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,030
- We'll be back.
- Yes. See you.

1435
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:28,510
This is very heart-warming
at the end of the year.

1436
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,950
Coming all the way here,

1437
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,150
it's too harsh to ask me
to stay seated.

1438
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,660
- The buffet is nice.
- It looks incredible.

1439
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,050
- There's so much food.
- I know. I don't know what to get.

1440
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,550
There's a lot of food here.

1441
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,760
- It's lamb, isn't it?
- Yes.

1442
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,550
One for Jae Suk.

1443
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,800
Jae Suk doesn't like it.

1444
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,400
It's lobster.

1445
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,300
(The lobsters are full of meat.)

1446
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,990
There's a lot of delicious food.

1447
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,260
Where is protein?

1448
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,780
I think there would be steak.

1449
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,650
It looks delicious.

1450
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,680
Should I try one of each thing?

1451
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,340
Is that it?

1452
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,680
- It's for Jae Suk.
- For Jae Suk?

1453
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,050
- Take that and... Come here.
- Yes.

1454
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,260
Should I get something that's not
easy to eat? Like crabs?

1455
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,430
Get him crabs.

1456
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,450
- Jae Suk doesn't like crabs.
- I'll get shrimps and crabs.

1457
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,800
Get shrimps too.
This one and this one.

1458
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,530
It's what Jae Suk hates the most.

1459
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,660
Good. That looks good.

1460
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,570
- Give it to him.
- Yes.

1461
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,680
You're a very muscular Rudolph.

1462
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,380
- Right? The headband is...
- Are you the server here?

1463
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,740
- Yes.
- I see.

1464
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,070
Do you like it?

1465
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:39,650
- No, you eat it.
- There's too much protein, right?

1466
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:42,380
- Yes. It looks too dry.
- It's mine.

1467
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,320
I always eat like this at a buffet.

1468
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,950
- Do you eat like this?
- Yes.

1469
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,950
- They'll get you coffee...
- There's so much nice food.

1470
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,880
when you ask at the table.

1471
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,990
There are so many kinds.

1472
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,550
I need to know
what they have to get...

1473
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,660
- Jae Suk.
- Come here.

1474
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,360
I need to know
what they have to get... Jae Suk.

1475
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,840
(Realizing)

1476
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,970
- Come here.
- Why?

1477
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,910
- I don't like peeling those.
- Just eat.

1478
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,430
You gave this to me on purpose,
didn't you?

1479
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,970
- No.
- You're telling me to walk.

1480
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,050
(You're telling me to walk.)

1481
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,840
No. That's your favorite.

1482
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,550
I can't eat this.

1483
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,220
- Why not?
- I don't like peeling.

1484
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,280
I might run out. For real.

1485
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,550
(He's about to go off,
seeing the shellfish.)

1486
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,860
- Hey.
- Let's not provoke him.

1487
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,430
- Right. Don't provoke me.
- I'll give you a piggyback ride.

1488
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,530
- Do you want to get what you want?
- Yes. Carry him around.

1489
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,220
- Can you show me around?
- Okay.

1490
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,260
Se Chan, follow us.

1491
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,820
- If he points at the food...
- No, you do it. I'll eat.

1492
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,590
I mean we can't get the food.

1493
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,090
He wants to film footage
for the show and you're saying no?

1494
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:37,130
Right. I want to film it
for the show.

1495
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,280
- So Min, you...
- Yes.

1496
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,800
- Can you carry him on your back?
- I'll carry him.

1497
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,700
- Are you okay?
- In 1, 2.

1498
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,880
My gosh.

1499
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,110
(Staggering)

1500
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,110
- My goodness.
- So Min.

1501
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,550
- Who didn't eat? Come here.
- I'll go.

1502
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,110
- I'll pick the food.
- If he points at the food...

1503
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:55,550
(Wearing the gloves slowly)

1504
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,300
So Min, can you put them on quickly?

1505
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,630
- Let's go.
- Gosh.

1506
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,630
- The mask.
- Don't we have to wear masks?

1507
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,700
We should wear masks.

1508
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,570
- My mask is over there.
- So Min. Put a mask on him.

1509
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,030
The lamb is really good.

1510
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,200
Put it in the middle
so that we can share it.

1511
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,910
(Let's go now!)

1512
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,070
- Hold on. The mask.
- Gosh.

1513
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:18,550
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

1514
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:20,550
- Jae Suk has started it.
- Don't choke me.

1515
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,590
- I should wear a mask.
- My gosh.

1516
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,610
(He used half of his energy
even before getting near the food.)

1517
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,650
Go.

1518
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:24,760
Go, Suk Jin.

1519
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,220
Suk Jin is in good condition today.

1520
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,180
Seriously, why...

1521
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:32,530
Why are you giving me
such a hard time?

1522
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,160
I should see what they have.

1523
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,430
- Hello.
- Hello. Pick the food.

1524
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,760
Suk Jin, put me up a little.

1525
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,530
There you go.

1526
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,360
- Be careful.
- The food is here.

1527
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,630
Short ribs.

1528
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:46,510
- Webfoot octopus.
- So Min.

1529
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,110
Can you get some webfoot octopus?

1530
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,380
- Don't choke me.
- All right.

1531
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,240
- Lobster.
- I don't want lobster.

1532
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,510
- Can you get the lobster?
- Never mind.

1533
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:56,550
- No.
- I'll eat it.

1534
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,860
- You can get it later.
- Put it on the plate.

1535
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,510
- We don't have time now.
- I'll get what Jae Suk wants now.

1536
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,160
Hello. The kimchi jeon.
Can you get two?

1537
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,220
(He gets webfoot octopus and kimchi
jeon instead of lobster and beef.)

1538
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,660
- Two pieces of kimchi jeon.
- Who gets kimchi jeon at a buffet?

1539
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,990
That's enough, So Min.

1540
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,470
- Who has kimchi jeon at a buffet?
- Suk Jin. That's what I want.

1541
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,860
You should get something nice.

1542
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,430
- Can you get pumpkin jeon?
- Pumpkin jeon?

1543
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,280
- Why would you...
- Thank you, So Min.

1544
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:19,700
I don't need soy sauce.

1545
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,740
- So Min, get some fritters.
- How many times...

1546
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:23,380
What kind of fritter?

1547
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,570
So Min, can you get fish and chips?

1548
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,150
Sure. I almost dropped it.

1549
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,840
- Let's go now. Where should we go?
- This way.

1550
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,720
- Let's go now. Hurry up.
- So Min.

1551
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,320
Can you get some eggplant for me?

1552
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,050
Why would you get eggplant
at a buffet?

1553
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,090
Why would you...

1554
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,050
- I just need two pieces.
- get eggplant at a buffet?

1555
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:40,550
- That's all good now.
- So Min, hurry up. I'm tired.

1556
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:41,900
- That's enough.
- I'm about to faint.

1557
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,990
(He's groggy.)

1558
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,570
We should take a look
at the left side as well.

1559
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:46,360
This is...

1560
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,840
("I Might Disappear" by Jukjae)

1561
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,930
- Let's do this.
- So Min. Right. The spaghetti.

1562
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,380
(It's a perfect song
for this situation.)

1563
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,240
Don't go down.

1564
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,300
- So Min. You should switch.
- Don't go down.

1565
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,340
- So Min. You should switch.
- What's the matter?

1566
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,380
- What is it?
- He can't carry me.

1567
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,590
You got this.

1568
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,550
It's good. Go.

1569
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,860
Why did you say you would do this?

1570
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:08,320
- What is he doing?
- You do it.

1571
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
What is he doing?

1572
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:11,860
(Tilting)

1573
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,320
- What's wrong?
- I'm so tired.

1574
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,400
- Why are you tired?
- It wasn't even a long time.

1575
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,030
- Why do you have no energy?
- Seriously.

1576
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,070
Why did you volunteer?

1577
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,260
I'm so tired.

1578
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,800
- This is delicious.
- The kimchi jeon is good.

1579
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,470
Why is he eating kimchi jeon
and pumpkin jeon at a buffet?

1580
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,200
- What's wrong with it?
- I'll enjoy the food.

1581
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,410
You need to get something like this
if you think about the price.

1582
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,410
Why do you get lamb only?

1583
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,550
This is so good.

1584
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,880
It's incredible.

1585
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,530
Once you acquire the taste of lamb,
you can't resist it.

1586
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,720
Ssaeb, eat this.

1587
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,590
He's not eating this. Let's eat it.

1588
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,990
- Jae Suk is not eating it.
- Right.

1589
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,030
Thank you.

1590
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,900
(Crunchy)

1591
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,970
This is delicious.

1592
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:53,930
We couldn't have a meal together
at the end of the year.

1593
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,260
- But they gave us the opportunity.
- Right.

1594
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,410
- It really feels like Christmas.
- Yes.

1595
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,700
- Can I take the plates?
- Can you?

1596
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,700
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

1597
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,780
Can you take my plates too?

1598
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,950
What are you doing on Christmas?

1599
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,740
I'm busy on Christmas too.

1600
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,950
That's good.

1601
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,860
- Right. Tell him to pick a gift.
- You can pick a gift.

1602
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,280
Yes. What are you doing
on Christmas?

1603
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,380
(Asking the staff member behind him)

1604
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,780
You'll be working, right?

1605
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,320
- Then come here. This is good.
- Oh, my.

1606
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,820
- This is good.
- I hope they get good ones.

1607
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,760
- I'm Santa today.
- There are gifts for you.

1608
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,760
And they are Rudolphs.

1609
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,760
We have...

1610
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,430
bluetooth earphones.

1611
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,200
Pajamas for couples too.

1612
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,680
- What's your name?
- I hope they get nice ones.

1613
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,680
I'm Lee Han Bi.

1614
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,740
- Miss Han Bi.
- Yes.

1615
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,700
- You can pick one.
- Yes.

1616
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,800
- You need luck.
- You quiz?

1617
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,220
I hope she picks a nice one.

1618
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,450
- What would you like to get?
- Your choice?

1619
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,570
Bluetooth earphones?

1620
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,380
- I got that.
- What number did you pick?

1621
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,380
(What present will go
to the hardworking staff?)

1622
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,650
- It's number 9.
- Number 9.

1623
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:45,910
- Number 9.
- What's number 9?

1624
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,990
- I hope it's a good one.
- Whose is it?

1625
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,090
- What is it?
- Congratulations.

1626
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:53,900
You'll get chestnut sweet potatoes
that Ji Hyo got.

1627
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,660
(Number 9 chestnut sweet potatoes)

1628
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,160
- Would that be okay?
- I'm sorry.

1629
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,900
- I don't think she's happy.
- Why did you get that?

1630
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,660
- Is that all right?
- Yes, it's all right.

1631
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,260
- Oh, dear.
- But Ji Hyo.

1632
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,630
- Sweet potatoes are fine...
- It wasn't supposed to be that.

1633
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,570
- Sweet potatoes are fine.
- It wasn't supposed to be that.

1634
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:10,550
- What's your name?
- She likes it, fortunately.

1635
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,650
Mr. Dae Hee.

1636
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:13,410
- You can also pick one.
- He will pick.

1637
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,950
I wanted Miss Han Bi
to choose a nice one.

1638
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,280
- I like it.
- Mr. Dae Hee.

1639
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,550
- It's number 45.
- Number 45.

1640
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,360
- Number 45?
- I think it will be a nice one.

1641
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,380
You will get a large Nike bag
that So Min got.

1642
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,860
That's a nice one.

1643
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,990
How nice for Mr. Dae Hee
and Miss Han Bi.

1644
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,090
It's this one.

1645
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,910
- It's not much, but So Min got it.
- Yes, it's not much.

1646
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,300
That's for...

1647
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,700
- Miss Han Bi.
- Choose one more.

1648
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,410
- No, it's all right.
- Choose one more.

1649
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:42,340
- Choose one more.
- Sweet potatoes are nice, but...

1650
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:45,010
there are some more nice things
prepared.

1651
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,010
(Will it be a nice present
this time?)

1652
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,180
- It's number 43.
- Number 43. That sounds good.

1653
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,820
Number 43 is a gift
that Haha prepared.

1654
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,590
- His gifts are bad.
- Pebbles for fish tanks.

1655
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,280
(It's a gift of stones.)

1656
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,680
(The hermit crab is out.)

1657
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,360
- I like it.
- No, it's not nice.

1658
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,900
- I'm sorry.
- Just one more.

1659
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,470
- I'm sorry.
- Pick just one more time.

1660
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,900
- Sorry, I didn't get it as a gift.
- Why did you get pebbles?

1661
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,110
I got it because I needed it.

1662
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,130
- Pick one more.
- I'm really sorry.

1663
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,470
- Should I pick now?
- Yes.

1664
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:12,930
- I'm sorry.
- Seriously.

1665
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:15,450
But I'm glad Mr. Dae Hee got a bag.

1666
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:17,380
- I hope you can use it.
- Do you like it?

1667
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,110
- It's number 34.
- Number 34.

1668
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,220
Please.

1669
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,910
Number 34...

1670
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,050
Please let it be a nice one.

1671
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,010
is a gift that Jae Suk got.

1672
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,610
- What is it?
- His gifts are all useless.

1673
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:29,530
- They're all children's gifts.
- It's a 3D sticker maker.

1674
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,780
It's okay.

1675
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,300
Stick them on your phone.

1676
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,990
- It's nice.
- It's pretty.

1677
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,260
- You can make stickers with it.
- It's nice.

1678
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,820
- It's pretty.
- Do you really like it?

1679
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,160
- I like it.
- You've never bought it before.

1680
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,160
It's cute.

1681
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,840
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1682
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1683
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,800
Merry Christmas.

1684
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,840
I really needed the fish tank sand.

1685
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,840
- Then...
- It's number three.

1686
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,110
- It's a good one.
- Number three.

1687
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,410
You get knee pads...

1688
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,680
that Jong Kook got.

1689
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,490
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1690
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:57,450
- It's better than toys.
- Congratulations.

1691
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,550
It's a little disappointing.

1692
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,660
- This...
- You have to lie down.

1693
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,030
- It's like a crib.
- You're like a baby.

1694
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:07,160
- What's that.
- Hello.

1695
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,590
Merry Christmas.

1696
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:10,900
Jae Suk isn't ill or anything.

1697
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,900
It's a mission.

1698
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,300
He isn't sick.

1699
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,300
- A drone is up too.
- We're just carrying him.

1700
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,300
- Our Santa is being carried.
- A drone is filming us.

1701
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,380
I never thought I'd cross
the crosswalk while lying down.

1702
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,680
- Nice.
- It must be nice.

1703
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,450
This is very nice.

1704
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,550
Look at that.

1705
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,380
This is Yoo Jae Suk.

1706
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,180
Don't do that.

1707
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,410
Jae Suk.

1708
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,010
Peekaboo.

1709
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,910
Jeon So Min.

1710
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:34,930
You'll be a good mom.

1711
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:36,360
Peekaboo.

1712
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,090
If you can do that all day,
I'll approve.

1713
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,990
You'll raise a baby well.

1714
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:41,990
He's like a baby.

1715
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:43,070
It's right there. We're here.

1716
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

1717
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,900

1719
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:49,260
- Hello.
- Merry Christmas.

1720
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,430
Have a wonderful day.

1721
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:53,070
- We're being welcomed.
- Hello.

1722
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,180
- Merry Christmas.
- Don't walk, but run.

1723
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,180
- Are we doing something here?
- I'm lying down.

1724
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,820
Sorry I'm greeting you while
lying down. I should wear a mask.

1725
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,110
- It's right here.
- Anyway,

1726
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:03,380
we're doing something here.

1727
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,110
Stay like that. Keep lying down.

1728
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:07,450
Shoot while lying down.

1729
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,260
I've been on TV for a long time,

1730
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,800
but I've never been so comfortable
while moving to another place.

1731
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,820
I was in a crib.

1732
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,300
- It looks very comfortable.
- Is it perfect for you?

1733
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,990
- It's perfect.
- It's perfect?

1734
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,840
- It looked comfortable.
- It's the best.

1735
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:24,800
The second mission is
Initial Consonant Quiz on Christmas.

1736
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,680
Two citizens and Running Man members
will work together...

1737
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,110
and respond with the right word...

1738
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,840
from the initial consonant
under the given keyword.

1739
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,910
I can do this well.

1740
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,910
You succeed if nine of you,
including two citizens,

1741
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:38,320
get the answer right continuously.

1742
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,820
- Good.
- Okay.

1743
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,430
As you've seen earlier,
we will make this.

1744
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:43,660
We make things work.

1745
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,090
- The MZ generation is good at this.
- That's right.

1746
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,090
- We can do this.
- It's easy for us.

1747
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,900
You can invite two citizens
who will join the mission.

1748
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,900
Two people?

1749
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,900
Who is good
at initial consonant game?

1750
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,900
- Initial consonant game.
- Anyone good at it?

1751
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,840
Who is good
at initial consonant game?

1752
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,280
- Someone is coming.
- Someone is coming.

1753
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,300
Are you good at it?

1754
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,800
You can come.

1755
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,570
- But...
- Are you good at the game?

1756
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,700
I'm good at it.

1757
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,220
Have you ever played
the initial consonant game?

1758
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,490
- One more person.
- What's PY?

1759
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,740

Please wait.

1761
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,010
Please wait?

1762
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,130
- Find someone good at it.
- Prayer.

1763
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,320
Is there a penalty
if I don't do well?

1764
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,990
- You should do well.
- If you don't do well,

1765
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,820
you have to lie down and get hit.

1766
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,260
You have to get hit by me.

1767
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,800

00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,300

00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,530
It's like I'm at their wedding,

1793
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,510
We have one Royal Salute left.

1794
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,720
I want someone to take that.

1795
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,550

01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,840

1799
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,220
Would that be all right?

1801

He wasn't good.

1803

Ready, start. Three,

59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,000
(Living thing, WM)

1804
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,490
- two.
- Watermelon.

1805
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,200
- It's a living thing.
- It's correct.

1806
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,300
It grows from the ground.

1807
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,510
- It grows.
- It's correct.

1808
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,110
- It grows.
- But it has no life.

1809
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,800
- Then what is this?
- It grows from the ground.

1810
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,200
How does something grow so big
if it doesn't have life?

1811
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,840
It grows because it's alive.

1812
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,010
- It's alive.
- It should breathe.

1813
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,010
It grows up because it breathes.

1814
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:51,010
Aren't plants alive?

1815
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,160
I'll remove a gift.

1816
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,110
They're too strict.

1817
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,630
- I can't think of anything.
- Number 36.

1818
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,680
- Number 36.
- It's the luggage bag.

1819
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,800
Oh, dear.

1820
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,660
You said you're good.

1821
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,490
- You can start.
- You can do it.

1822
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,530
- Okay. I'll start.
- I'll start, then.

1823
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,360
- It's difficult.
- It's difficult.

1824
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,470
- I'll go again.
- Good luck, Haha.

1825
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:10,240
- Let's collaborate.
- One, two, three.

1826
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,910
Three, two,

- one.
- Jelly.

1828
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:14,680
(Living thing, TT)

1829
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:16,010
- One.
- Jelly.

1830
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:18,110
- It's a turtle.
- Turtle.

1831
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,220
- Turtle.
- Why are you swearing?

1832
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,010
- Turtle!
- You said you're good.

1833
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,610
- Come out.
- Turtle.

1834
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,910
I'll remove one gift.

1835
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:27,610
A black trouser that Jong Kook got
will be removed.

1836
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:29,280
What a waste.

1837
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,990
- Jong Kook.
- That's a comfortable one.

1838
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:34,400
I've not spoken yet.

1839
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,990
- Try. Give it a go.
- I'll start. Let me go.

1840
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,260
This has wheels.

1841
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,660
- This is scary.
- Okay.

1842
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,630
Okay. Let's go.

1843
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:41,630
Good luck!

1844
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:44,860
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

1845
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,680
One, two, three.

1846
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:50,240
Three, two, one.

1847
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:51,470
It's a Shiba dog.

1848
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,470
- Shiba dog.
- Shiba dog.

1849
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,840
It's a Shiba dog.

1850
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:56,820
- I can only think of bad words.
- It's so difficult.

1851
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:58,510
I'm sorry, but only bad words
come to mind.

1852
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,220
Why are all the words like that?

1853
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,130
I only thought of bad words.

1854
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:05,300
This is driving me crazy.

1855
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,820
I'll start.

1856
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:07,990
- Okay.
- I'll start.

1857
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,400
- Start.
- Three.

1858
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,070
- Pepper.
- That's right.

1859
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,200
- Let's give them gifts.
- Start.

1860
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:14,800
- Three, two,
- Mushroom.

1861
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,010
- Mushroom.
- one.

1862
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:18,610
- Stop.
- Start.

1863
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,740
Go on.

1864
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,300
Three, two, one.

1865
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,740
(Living thing, SB)

1866
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,510
(Whatever.)

1867
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,720
I mean...

1868
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,740
- So Min.
- But...

1869
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,660
- We're being recorded.
- What else is there?

1870
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,680
- What other word is there?
- They're all recording.

1871
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,680
But it's not watermelon.

1872
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,820
- What was it earlier?
- Watermelon.

1873
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,490
SinB.

1874
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:40,930
There's SinB of GFRIEND.

1875
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:43,800
- SinB.
- SinB of GFRIEND.

1876
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,590
- We'll start with Suk Jin.
- I'll go first.

1877
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,740
- Seok Sam.
- It will end with Haha.

1878
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,800
Shall we succeed it?

1879
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,360
I'll get it right. I'll start.

1880
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,570
- Okay.
- Could you cheer for me?

1881
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:51,930
- Good luck!
- Cheer for me, please.

1882
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,010
Good luck.

1883
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:54,700
- Good luck.
- Go on.

1884
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,510
- Let's go.
- One, two, three.

1885
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,110
One, two,

1886
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:03,380
Good job.

1887
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,950
(It's a poor answer
compared to the cheers he got.)

1888
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,610
- Sam Kim.
- What's "good job?"

1889
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,010
What living thing is there?

1890
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:09,380
- Sam Kim!
- Sam Kim.

1891
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,490
We should think of people's names
first.

1892
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,430
- We should think of people's names.
- Suk Jin,

1893
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,490
- there's a way to play this game.
- I know now.

1894
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:16,800
Think of people's names first.

1895
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:17,900
You realized it just now too.

1896
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,630
What?

1897
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,070
We got to know now.

1898
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:23,510
I'll remove number 24,
the fish tank set.

1899
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:24,700
That's mine.

1900
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,780
- Se Chan can start.
- Let's start from Se Chan.

1901
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,910
- Se Chan.
- Count the numbers slowly.

1902
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:32,410
- One, two, three, and go.
- Three.

1903
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:33,910
Start.

1904
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,180
- One,
- Go Soo.

1905
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,180
- That's right.
- Right.

1906
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,720
That was great.

1907
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,490
- The question is...
- It's Jung Hoon.

1908
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:42,720
One, two,

1909
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,180
BE'O. The singer.

1910
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,900
- BE'O.
- Okay.

1911
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,360
- Singer BE'O.
- Good.

1912
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,590
- BE'O.
- It's So Min.

1913
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:50,930
One, two,

1914
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,740
- Frog!
- Okay.

1915
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,860
You got a good one.

1916
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,970
- One, two, three.
- She's an MZ generation.

1917
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,300
Three, two,

1918
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,300
- Bibimbap.
- Okay.

1919
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,430
- I thought of Bibibik.
- Good.

1920
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:02,650
Good job.

1921
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,950
- It's me. I'm so nervous.
- Go on.

1922
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:07,220
Ah Reum will be the last.

1923
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,510
- It's here.
- Ah Reum will be the last.

1924
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:10,010
Three, two,

1925
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,180
Stingray.

1926
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,680
- Gosh.
- What was that?

1927
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,530
- Stingray.
- Gosh.

1928
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:17,660
- Cat.
- You didn't know, honestly.

1929
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,300
- You didn't know.
- Couldn't you tell?

1930
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,360
He didn't know either.

1931
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,360
- I'm allergic to cats.
- He didn't know.

1932
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:23,990
- But it's a cat.
- It's Haha's gift.

1933
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,400
What's removed?

1934
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,400
What?

1935
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,930
- Is the liquor out?
- What is it?

1936
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,340
- Liquor.
- Johnnie Walker.

1937
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:31,970
- My goodness, one liquor is out.
- It's a nice present.

1938
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,280
One liquor remains.

1939
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,340
- This won't do.
- Should I go first?

1940
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,110
- In that case...
- Give it a go.

1941
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:38,240
- I will give it a go.
- Okay.

1942
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,240
- He became confident.
- I got this.

1943
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,450
- Okay.
- Let's begin.

1944
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:43,180
One, two,

1945
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,990
- three.
- Obangtteok.

1946
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:47,260
Obangtteok.

1947
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,880
- Obama.
- Obama.

1948
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:50,660
- Obama.
- Where did "Obangtteok" come from?

1949
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,360
Don't do it. You should go last.

1950
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,320
- Where did "Obangtteok" come from?
- Obangtteok.

1951
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,090
And obangtteok isn't alive either.

1952
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,220
Obangtteok is food.

1953
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,800
- Seriously.
- Were you that nervous?

1954
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,260
He embarrassed himself.

1955
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:04,240
Why are you so intimidated?

1956
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,530
- This is driving me crazy.
- All right.

1957
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:08,950
- It's so hard.
- I will give you an easy one.

1958
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:11,180
- Give us an easy one.
- Is there an easy one? Okay.

1959
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,340
- Suk Jin.
- It's an easy one.

1960
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,950
- Suk Jin, let's go.
- Let's go.

1961
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:15,110
Let's begin.

1962
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,410
Three, two...

1963
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,650
- Momo.
- Momo.

1964
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,720
- Momo of TWICE.
- Momo is correct.

1965
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,990
- Momo of TWICE.
- Good job.

1966
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,880
- You did a good job.
- Good job.

1967
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,030
- Momo of TWICE.
- Let's go.

1968
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,550
Let's begin.

1969
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:26,820
Three, two...

1970
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,220
Jaws. Juice.

1971
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,400
- Juice.
- Juice works.

1972
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,990
- Juice, not jaws.
- Juice works.

1973
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,700
- Let's go.
- Let's begin.

1974
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,300
- Three, two, one.
- Meat-ri.

1975
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,610
It's "Frog."

1976
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:40,130
(Incorrect)

1977
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:41,630
Three, two, one.

1978
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:42,800
Meat-ri.

1979
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,050
It's "Frog."

1980
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:47,180
- Frog.
- What on earth is "Meat-ri?"

1981
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,380
- We had it earlier.
- He is bad at this.

1982
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:49,880
- Boo.
- Hey.

1983
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,490
What was that?

1984
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,550
Why did you do that?

1985
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:53,590
- Again?
- "Goguri?"

1986
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,430
- Why did you do that? It's "Frog."
- I am sorry.

1987
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,930
- I see that Jae Suk is popular.
- We had "Frog" earlier.

1988
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:57,930
You know,

1989
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:01,030
it drives me insane
that Suk Jin asked people...

1990
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:02,700
- to boo at me.
- I realized...

1991
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,860
that you are popular.
They didn't boo at you.

1992
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,430
My goodness.

1993
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,340
- This is so hard.
- They didn't boo at you.

1994
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,300
- Go ahead.
- Frog.

1995
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:13,800
- Four, five...
- It's... What's this?

1996
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,800
- One.
- Willow.

1997
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,740
- Park Gi Rin.
- What?

1998
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,150
- Five.
- Mushroom stew.

1999
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:20,970
- One.
- Chocho?

2000
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,320
- It's "Tuna."
- It's "Tuna."

2001
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,150
We did "Tuna" earlier.

2002
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,510
- Tuna.
- This is so embarrassing.

2003
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,280
- It's over.
- This is so embarrassing.

2004
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,180
We are out of questions.

2005
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:32,200
- However,
- It's okay.

2006
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,450
- we will give a present...
- It wasn't half bad.

2007
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:34,720
- to the citizens who joined us.
- Okay.

2008
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,220
- Okay.
- Please pick a number.

2009
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,660
So we didn't succeed in completing
the mission.

2010
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:41,070
- It feels awkward.
- You should aim for number 21.

2011
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,030
- Number 21?
- Number 21.

2012
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:44,630
"Miracle in Cell No. 21."

2013
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:46,380
- It's number 12.
- Number 12.

2014
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,630
- The numbers are the opposite.
- Number 12. Congratulations.

2015
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,950
You got a pair of black sweatpants
Jong Kook picked.

2016
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:51,950
(Black sweatpants)

2017
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:54,220
They aren't half bad.

2018
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,820
- Wear them to bed.
- They aren't half bad.

2019
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,150
- She likes them.
- They aren't half bad.

2020
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,260
- They aren't half bad.
- Didn't he take them out earlier?

2021
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,180
- They aren't half bad.
- I feel sleepy already.

2022
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,550
Didn't he take them out earlier?

2023
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,760
- They are pretty nice, right?
- He bought four pairs.

2024
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,760
- They are comfortable.
- Four pairs?

2025
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:07,950
- They are comfortable and nice.
- I asked them,

2026
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:09,320
"Didn't he take them out earlier?"

2027
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,400
- Apparently, he bought 4 pairs.
- Did he buy 4 pairs?

2028
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,260
- He said he will take them out.
- Why did you take out three pairs?

2029
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:14,400
They were different.

2030
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:17,360
- Four pairs of black pants.
- They were different.

2031
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,510
Congratulations.
You got the item Jae Suk picked,

2032
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:22,240
- the talking Heartsping.
- What?

2033
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,470
Kids love it.

2034
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:24,880
- It's cute.
- Na Eun loves it.

2035
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,340
It's cute.

2036
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,280
Jung Hoon, would you sell it to me?

2037
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:30,610
Na Eun loves it.

2038
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,860
- They worked hard.
- The citizens joined us...

2039
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,990
for the second mission.

2040
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:39,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2041
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:40,530
- Thank you.
- Take care, Jung Hoon.

2042
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:42,130
- Enjoy the pants.
- Be happy.

2043
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:44,470
- The talking Heartsping is cute.
- Thank you.

2044
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,430
- Bye.
- My goodness.

2045
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,740
You failed to complete
the second mission.

2046
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:51,800
- Now, 24 presents remain.
- Are there any presents left?

2047
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,380
We still have many presents.

2048
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:55,300
I didn't know
we were so bad at games.

2049
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,550
It was hard.

2050
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:58,410
You did much worse than us.

2051
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,240
- You messed it up.
- You got five questions wrong.

2052
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,680
- What's "Chocho?"
- I don't know.

2053
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,220
- What's "Chocho?"
- I don't remember.

2054
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,490
- You messed it up.
- I don't know why I said "Chocho."

2055
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:07,180
- Why couldn't I think of "Tuna?"
- What was "Meat-ri?"

2056
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,680
- Jae Suk messed it up.
- Meat-ri.

2057
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,930
- Meat-ri...
- Meat-ri.

2058
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,900
- The last location is inside.
- Shall we go?

2059
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,950
Is it inside? Let's go.

2060
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:16,490
- We should put on a mask.
- Sit down.

2061
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:18,590
Everyone, merry Christmas.

2062
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:20,260
Merry Christmas.

2063
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,860
- Thank you. Be happy.
- Thank you.

2064
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:23,860
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2065
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,470
- Bye.
- Okay.

2066
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:28,010
- Let's go.
- This is a nice department store.

2067
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:30,380
- It's really big.
- Hello.

2068
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,680
(They begin to stroll around
with Jae Suk in a kid's wagon.)

2069
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,340
People will think
that Jae Suk is sick.

2070
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,150
Jae Suk isn't sick.

2071
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,590
There is no need to say that.

2072
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,610
- Jae Suk isn't sick.
- Suk Jin.

2073
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:41,860
Suk Jin, for goodness' sake.

2074
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:43,490
- I want to clear up...
- There is no need to say that.

2075
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:45,550
- any misunderstandings.
- Look. This place is incredible.

2076
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:46,990
Is it an amusement park?

2077
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,530
- Is this the location?
- It's so pretty.

2078
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:50,720
Is it an amusement park?

2079
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:52,070
It's so pretty.

2080
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:53,400
It really feels like Christmas.

2081
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:55,540
Ji Hyo, it's so pretty.

2082
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,870
(The Christmas village in Yeouido
is popular on social media.)

2083
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:58,630
(There is a fancy Christmas tree
of an enormous size too.)

2084
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,930
- It's insane.
- This is cool.

2085
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:03,110
(Santa Yoo and the six Rudolphs
arrive at the fairy tale village.)

2086
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:05,300
This department store is amazing.

2087
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,340
(So Min goes wide-eyed.)

2088
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:07,470
It's a teddy bear.

2089
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,450
What's this? It's sleeping.

2090
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,010
Are you sleeping?

2091
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,820
It's sleeping. It looks real. Hello.

2092
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,050
Gosh, what's this?

2093
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,620
I feel like I am in "Home Alone."

2094
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,050
(The Christmas vibe excites
even the cool-blooded Jong Kook.)

2095
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,050
It's pretty.

2096
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:23,070
- Isn't it fascinating?
- It's cute.

2097
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,120
It's fascinating.

2098
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,670
It's so nice.

2099
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:27,260
(Jong Kook is filming.)

2100
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,170
- It's so pretty.
- It's pretty.

2101
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,460
Move out of the way.

2102
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,630
(So Min entered
Jong Kook's camera angle.)

2103
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:33,910
Take photos of me, Jong Kook.

2104
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:35,170
(Take photos of me, Jong Kook.)

2105
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:37,840
- It's so pretty.
- All set.

2106
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,210
Thank you.

2107
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:42,170
- I trust you. You take nice photos.
- I will help you.

2108
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:43,490
Se Chan takes bad photos.

2109
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,160
I am moved to tears.

2110
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:48,320
It's so pretty.

2111
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,120
Look at So Min.

2112
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,460
Look at So Min.

2113
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,160
Ji Hyo doesn't disappoint.

2114
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,120
- She is calm.
- She is calm.

2115
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,530
(Ji Hyo looks around calmly.)

2116
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:00,370
- It's so pretty.
- I don't have that sentimentality.

2117
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:01,400
No, you don't.

2118
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,910
One, two, three.

2119
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:04,610
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2120
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:07,470
I feel so touched.

2121
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:11,340
- You have 23 presents left.
- Yes.

2122
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:14,280
The last mission that will decide
the fate of the presents is...

2123
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,920
the As Many as You Can Jegichagi.

2124
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,210
- What's that?
- Jegichagi.

2125
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,540
- Jegichagi?
- I am bad at it.

2126
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:19,960
The rules are simple.

2127
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,880
Recruit two citizens...

2128
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,550
- and kick it a total of 80 times.
- A total of 80 times.

2129
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:25,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

2130
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,750
You will be given three chances.

2131
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:29,120
If you succeed at once,

2132
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,790
you can give away
all the remaining presents.

2133
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:34,370
With each failed attempt,
we will take out three presents.

2134
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:35,570
Okay.

2135
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:38,800
Since this mission involves
the feet,

2136
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,500
Jae Suk's feet
can touch the ground.

2137
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,870
- Can I get off the wagon now?
- Yes.

2138
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,210
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

2139
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:45,650
- There we go.
- Okay.

2140
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:49,250
- You feel comfortable, right?
- Recruit two citizens.

2141
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,920
- Rudolphs, get to work.
- Okay.

2142
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:52,510
So Min, let's go.

2143
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:53,860
(Galloping)

2144
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:55,620
Give me a mask.

2145
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,790
- Who is good at jegichagi?
- By any chance...

2146
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,790
- Who is good at jegichagi?
- Are you good at jegichagi?

2147
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,030
- Jegichagi.
- Me.

2148
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:03,090
- Are you good at it?
- How many times can you kick it?

2149
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,870
- About 20 times.
- Okay. Come here.

2150
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,330
- Who is good at it?
- Here.

2151
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,260
- Come here. We are set.
- All right.

2152
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,740
- Hello.
- Hello. Please come this way.

2153
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,580
Hello. Please come this way.

2154
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:13,910
Are you good at jegichagi?

2155
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:15,210
A little bit.

2156
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

2157
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,670
We got Generation MZs.

2158
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:18,800
What's your name?

2159
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,920
My name is Cho Bak Seung.

2160
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,340
- Bak Seung. How about you?
- Yes.

2161
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,080
- My name is Song Sang Won.
- Sang Won.

2162
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,680
Shouldn't they practice?

2163
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,710
Kick the jegi.

2164
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:28,050
- Let's see how good you are.
- Okay.

2165
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,360
- Good.
- He is the real deal.

2166
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,830
- Good.
- He knows how it's done.

2167
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,200
My goodness.

2168
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,590
- Hold on.
- Get out.

2169
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:39,700
(What?)

2170
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,900
- Hold on.
- Get out.

2171
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,740
- Hold on.
- Hey.

2172
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,460
- When was the last time you did it?
- What was that?

2173
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,240
- Less than a month ago.
- Really?

2174
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,670
- Try it again.
- There was a competition at work.

2175
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,110
- Was there a competition?
- Try it again.

2176
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,340
- Maybe you are nervous.
- It's plausible.

2177
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,670
He did badly for someone
who entered a competition.

2178
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:53,870
How well did you do
at the competition?

2179
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:55,750
I kicked it about 15 times.

2180
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,580
He did pretty well.

2181
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,840
- One.
- What?

2182
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,620
Bak Seung, what was that?

2183
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,680
- We need to talk.
- Oh, you are Bak Seung.

2184
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:04,380
- Bak Seung, give it a go.
- I am under so much pressure.

2185
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,030
- You can't do it well.
- The left foot.

2186
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:08,860
- For goodness' sake.
- Bak Seung.

2187
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,570
- What's up with you guys?
- Get out.

2188
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,200
- How old are you guys?
- Get out.

2189
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:14,040
- Hurry up and get out.
- Who recruited them?

2190
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,700
- Who recruited them?
- What was that?

2191
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:16,760
They are really bad at this.

2192
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,460
- Since they are here...
- It can't be helped.

2193
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,580
- Really?
- It can't be helped.

2194
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,080
Meat-ri will do well.

2195
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,170
I am in good condition today.

2196
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,110
(Practice time earlier)

2197
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:26,870
- Two.

2198
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,470

2201
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:33,680

2202
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:35,920

01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:38,080
- One, two, three. Let's go.
- Let's go.

2204
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,200
- Up or down?
- Please begin the first attempt.

2205
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,120
- Who will go first?
- Among us...

2206
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,700
- I will go first.
- Ji Hyo.

2207
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,090
- Ji Hyo.
- Okay.

2208
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,590
- Just do two.
- Two.

2209
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:48,870
Hairtail, do five.

2210
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,240
Hairtail.

2211
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:52,710
- I will kick it when it comes down.
- Okay.

2212
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:54,430
- One, two.
- There you go. Two.

2213
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,670
- Two.
- All right. Two is a good record.

2214
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:58,040
- Good.
- I kicked it two times.

2215
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,080
- Kick it as you did earlier.
- Kick it as you did earlier.

2216
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,510
- You did 4 earlier.
- I usually can't do 4.

2217
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,080
- Kick it as you did earlier.
- You did four earlier.

2218
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,650
Then today will be
her day of success.

2219
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:05,920
I usually can't do four.

2220
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:07,160
Don't disturb her.

2221
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,710
- One, two.

2222
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:09,720

- Should I go next?

2225
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:14,960
- I can't kick it.
- It's hard.

2226
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,760
If you catch it, you can start over.

2227
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,790
- Okay.
- I should have done that.

2228
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,930
Jae Suk is in good condition today.

2229
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:22,070
- I am in good condition today.
- You should kick it 50 times.

2230
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:23,170
I am in good condition today.

2231
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:25,370

- Kick it over ten times each.

2232
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:27,000
- You are wearing good shoes for it.

2233
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,300
- Should I pull them up?
- Pull them up. There you go.

2234
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,750
- I won't get nervous.
- Pull up your pants more.

2235
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:33,840
Pull up your pants more.

2236

2237
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:37,680
- That's good.
- You are set.

2238
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,010
Just take off your pants, Suk Jin.

2239
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,820
Okay.

2240
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,790
(Number 3, Suk Jin, Total)

2241
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:44,080
You caught it.

- Good job.

2246
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:53,630

2247
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:55,290
- Relax.
- He must be under pressure.

2248
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:57,260
Two, three, four.

01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,470
you look a bit like a man
who works at a circus.

2256
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:07,920
- You are right.
- I...

2257
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,290
- A man who works at a circus.
- This is...

2258
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,450
I want to succeed in it.

2259
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:13,420

I did so well during practice.
Why did I kick it four times?

- The tassel is falling apart.
- Hey.

2335
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,790
- Is it balding?
- It's balding.

2336
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,160
- How hard did you pull it?
- Give me a new one.

2337
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,550
- This one would be better.
- Okay.

2338
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,400
- It's falling apart.
- This is driving me crazy.

2339
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,920
- Here I go.
- Go ahead.

2340
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:40,290

- You are good.

2342

(Number 8, Se Chan: 8, Total: 50)

2343
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,630

- Good job.

2344
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:48,910
- Your total is 50.
- Did you say 50?

2345
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,580
- Do I need to kick it 30 times?
- That's right.

2346
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:53,150
It won't work.

2347
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,280
- Here I go.
- Let's go.

2348
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,680
- How many do you need to do?
- Thirty.

2349
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,650
- You can do it. Perform a miracle.
- Here I go.

2350
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,080
If he gets the hang of it,

2351
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,510
- he will be able to do it.
- That's right.

2352
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:02,720
Just get into the flow.

2353
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,920

2364
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,250

30 times?)

2365
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,250
Twenty-five.

2366
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:33,920
- So close.
- He kicked it so well.

2367
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,360
- Gosh, it was so close.
- You saw that, right?

2368
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:38,960
- We only had five more to go.
- It was so close.

2369
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,790
- In that case,
- I should have done five more.

2370
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,760
three presents will be taken out.
Then you can begin the second try.

2371
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,900
- Okay.
- Take out three presents.

2372
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,760
- Let's do it again.
- Okay.

2373
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,330

2374

2376
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,250
- Let me give it a go.
- Se Chan, what's that?

2377
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,280
(Se Chan borrowed a shoe
from somewhere.)

2378
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,780
- Se Chan, what's that on your foot?
- One.

2379
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,250
What's that on your foot?

2380
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:04,820
My goodness.
His skills improved with a new shoe.

2381
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,360

2382
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,160

- We are set.

2383
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,660
- Good.
- Kick it like that.

2384
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,160
- It depends on the shoes.
- Is it yours?

2385
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,050
- We are set.
- It depends on the shoes.

2386
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:15,400
- Let's kick it 80 times.
- Let's go.

2387

- Let's bring our hands together.
- Let's go.

2388
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:19,430
One, two, three.

2389
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:20,460
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2390
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,400
- I put my hand down.
- Why did you do it by yourself?

2391
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,800
Here I go. I will begin.

2392
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:29,300
- One.
- My goodness.

2393
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,370
One.

2394
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:32,370
My goodness.

2395
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,510
- I am sorry.
- One.

2396
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,150
- One.
- Can I start over?

2397
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,250
- Ji Hyo, it's okay.
- That's right.

2398
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,580
- It's okay.
- I am sorry.

2399
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,990
So Min can kick it three times.

2400
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,330
- Three times?
- So Min.

2401
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:46,750
- Kick it 3 times.
- Kick it 3 times.

2402
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,860
Kick it three times for me.

2403
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,720
My instructor told me
to keep my body low.

01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:56,460
- Hey.
- I couldn't do it.

2407
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:57,740
(So Min kicked it once too.)

2408
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:58,870
Get rid of her.

2409
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:02,240
She kept her body low
and kicked elsewhere.

2410
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,210
(They have a bad feeling
about the second attempt.)

2411
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:05,370
I keep getting worse.

2412
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:06,370

in the second half?)

more than 20 times.

- I kicked it over 20 times.
- But Jae Suk gets nervous.

2490

Just kick it 6 times.

2493
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:36,400
Look elsewhere.

2494
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,220
Don't get nervous.

2495
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:39,760

2497
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:41,870
My goodness.

2498
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,130
- You know about my condition.
- Yes, I do.

2499
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:46,110
- I have a condition.
- It's okay.

2500
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,210
It's a nerve-racking situation.

2501
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:48,280
- Six.
- You are good.

2502
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,280
Okay.

2503
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:52,170
- One, two, three, four...
- Good. Three, four...

2504
01:21:58,570 --> 01:21:59,870
- We are set.
- Five.

2505
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:03,650
(Santa Yoo's foot holds
the fate of dozens of presents.)

2506
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,850
(What will be the result?)

2507
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:06,860
- three, four...
- Three, four...

2508
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,220
- We are set.
- Five.

2509
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:09,620
(Number 9, Jae Suk: 5, Total: 79)

2510
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:12,060
(Number 9, Jae Suk: 6, Total: 80)

2511
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,520
- Six. Okay.
- Six, seven, eight,

2512
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,730
- nine, ten.
- Okay.

2513
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,230
- Catch it.
- Catch it. Twelve.

2514
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:19,490
You are doing well
since you aren't nervous.

2515
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:20,900
- Fifteen.
- Okay.

2516
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,360
You succeeded in completing
the mission.

2517
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:27,070
We did it.

2518
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:28,570
How nice. Okay.

2519
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:30,270
- Number 2.
- Number 2.

2520
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:31,810
- Pajamas.
- It's a good present.

2521
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:32,850
(The jegichagi soldiers
get a present each.)

2522
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:35,650
Give it to your mother.
I bought it for my mother.

2523
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:36,910
It's nice. It cost 100 dollars.

2524
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:37,910
Number 19.

2525
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:39,050
It's this one.

2526
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:40,690
This one is a bit...
Tell him to pick another one.

2527
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:42,190
It must be a sticker.

2528
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,230
I love it.

2529
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,860
I love it.

2530
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:47,760
- I bought it for my daughter.
- I love it.

2531
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,300
- I like it.
- Heartsping.

2532
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,860
Thank you.

2533
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:53,360
- Thank you.
- The two of you, thank you.

2534
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,330
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2535
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:57,400
Merry Christmas.

2536
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,230
Thus, the Christmas Special
came to an end.

2537
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:01,730
Merry Christmas.

2538
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:04,440
I said the 1st shoot of 2023
will be moved up by 10 minutes...

2539
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,110
every time Jae Suk's feet...

2540
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:07,820
- touched the ground.
- I forgot about that.

2541
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:08,870
How much did it get moved up?

2542
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:10,520
The usual time is 10 a.m.

2543
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,190
The time got moved up by 3 hours,
so we will meet at 7 a.m.

2544
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,260
Then I will need to leave home
by 3 a.m.

2545
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:19,190
- I guess 7 a.m. isn't too bad.
- I will need to leave home by 3 a.m.

2546
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:20,190
You will be fine,

2547
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:21,620
but some members visit
the beauty salon beforehand.

2548
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,970
Will we meet at 7 a.m.?

2549
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:24,860
Ji Hyo, we will need to leave home
at 3 a.m.

2550
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:27,330
And you can choose one gift each.

2551
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:28,330
Can we do that?

2552
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:29,830
- Yes.
- That sounds nice.

2553
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:31,440
- What is mine?
- Number 32.

2554
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,440
Number 32.

2555
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,940
- This is number 32.
- This is it.

2556
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:35,070
This is a nice one.

2557
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:36,240
I like it.

2558
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,240
A hip sack.

2559
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,050
- Gosh.
- Number four.

2560
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,980
- It's beef. Nice.
- Thank you.

2561
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,080
- Okay.
- This is nice.

2562
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,580
- Wine glasses.
- That's a good one.

2563
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:46,080
Gosh, this is...

2564
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,720
- Hey, Jeon So Min.
- That's mine.

2565
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,760
- I bought it. A toilet brush.
- My turn.

2566
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:51,860
- All right. Haha.
- Number 46.

2567
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:53,300
- Olive oil.
- Olive oil.

2568
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,120
- It's olive oil.
- That's nice.

2569
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,230
Pick number 21, Se Chan.

2570
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:59,230
- That's what you picked.
- The whiskey.

2571
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:01,440
- We never know.
- You should get what you picked.

2572
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,200
The variety deity
might do something for you.

2573
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,470
Number 21.

2574
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:06,140
- My gosh.
- I don't think that's number 21.

2575
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,440
- What is it?
- Number eight.

2576
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,110
- Number eight?
- What is it?

2577
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,440
- Pants.
- It's the pants.

2578
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,350
- It's your pants.
- How many of these are there?

2579
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:16,690
How many did you buy?

2580
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,980
- These pants...
- You can wear them when you sleep.

2581
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:21,060
- The pants...
- They are really warm. Touch them.

2582
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,320
- This is scary.
- Aren't they nice?

2583
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,450
- The pants keep coming out.
- How many of them are there?

2584
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:26,060
They fit you perfectly.

2585
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,150
- I like them.
- It looks perfect. My gosh.

2586
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,020
- I'm scared.
- My gosh.

2587
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,660
I want
the Secret Jouju sticker book.

2588
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:33,800
(Na Eun's dad wants
a sticker book for his daughter.)

2589
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,330
I bet you'll pick number 21.

2590
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:37,570
That's the worst gift for me.

2591
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:38,570
You can give it to him.

2592
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:40,730
- Number 23.
- It's number 23. It's Jordan.

2593
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,680
- I bet it's Jouju. It's Jouju.
- My goodness.

2594
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:44,850
- He got it.
- Really?

2595
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:46,850
(He really got it!)

2596
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:48,320
- That's amazing.
- You got a good one.

2597
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,580
This is so nice.

2598
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:52,520
My gosh. I can't believe I got this.

2599
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,780
I got a good one.

2600
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:57,450
All right. Thanks to you,
the end of the year will be warm.

2601
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,820
- Are you sure it's warm?
- It is.

2602
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,900
We will give out
the rest of the gifts to citizens.

2603
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:07,800
(The rest of the gifts were
given out to citizens.)

2604
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:13,030
(We thank all the citizens
we met throughout Seoul today.)

2605
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:14,180
You may go home now.

2606
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,330
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

2607
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:16,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2608
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,480
We will see you on January 1, 2023,

2609
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:22,220
at 6:20 p.m. Bye.

2610
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,610
- Thank you.
- Be happy.

2611
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:26,080
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

2612
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,980
(December 17, 2022,
the SBS Entertainment Awards)

2613
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:32,820
And we have another reason
to run even harder next year.

2614
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:37,190
Yes, starting on January 1, 2023,

2615
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:40,690
(Starting from next year,
Running Man will air at 6:20 p.m.)

2616
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:43,530
I'll make it
a ferocious battlefield.

2617
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:49,770
(And they prepared a small gathering
to develop a special bond.)

2618
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:51,510
(And the next shoot)

2619
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:52,810
(We have to spend the night here.)

2620
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:54,570
- It's really cold here.
- It's so cold.

2621
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:58,220
(It's a village
where the snow has not melted.)

2622
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:01,320
(A place with a snowstorm?)

2623
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:06,190
(The members arrive at
the ferocious battlefield with ash.)

2624
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,650
(I told you
not to put in the newspaper.)

2625
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:10,120
You keep showing off your
experience from "Family Outing."

2626
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:14,330
(Episode 1, Running Man Outing)

2627
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,860
(Running Man Family Outing?)

2628
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,680
(Cinderella Woo is invited
to the family occasion.)

2629
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,870
(Scolded)

2630
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:21,870
(Looking away)

2631
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:23,480
I'll add
the ramyeon soup powder anyway.

2632
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:25,680
(Surprisingly, the three meals
taste just the same!)

2633
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,440
(Putting in the whole bag)

2634
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,610
(Will the fools be able
to have a decent meal?)

2635
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:30,780
Is the rice ready?

2636
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,320
I think we should cook rice again.

2637
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:35,890
(A family is...)

2638
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,080
(someone you want to give
your everything to.)

2639
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,280
(A family is...)

2640
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,800
(is someone to be happy with.)

2641
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,230
(A family is...)

2642
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:47,600
(When you're
with your family all day...)

2643
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,530
(You want to go home.)
