1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,410
(More friendly)

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,410
(More novel)

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,520
(2023 Running Man)

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,130
Why do you have so much stuff?

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,860
Why do we need a suitcase in the New Year?
It's so contrived.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,530
It's not like
we're going on a long trip.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,160
It's cold.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,930
Hello. It's so cold today.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,890
The weather is really cold.

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,860
Suk Jin is getting on a plane soon.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,380
Why are you...
Hey, it will be just an overnight trip.

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,610
- Are you moving? Why is it...
- Because it's cold.

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,670
- We need a lot of clothes.
- You and I are being reasonable.

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,340
Suk Jin, I have one more suitcase
that's bigger than this.

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,520
- One more?
- Yes.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,410
- Hello, Jae Suk.
- This is piquant.

18
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,310
- He also brought a big one.
- This is enough.

19
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,310
This is piquant.

20
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,160
Why do you have such a big suitcase?

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,260
You have Na Eun's suitcase.

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,420
Hey, is it that only those who
experienced "Family Outing"...

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,660
- brought big bags?
- Suk Jin.

24
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,990
You brought something compact.

25
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,270
- Compact?
- You brought something compact.

26
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,400
Your glasses steamed up.

27
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,490
- Where's Haha?
- Gosh.

28
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,810
- There he is.
- Hello.

29
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,770
- Haha.
- Hello.

30
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,910
- Haha.
- Haha.

31
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,440
- You look better now.
- I feel much better now.

32
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,530
I'm all good.

33
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,650
Are you feeling better?
I heard Se Chan would come later tonight.

34
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,710
- Tonight.
- After work.

35
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,910
We all caught COVID-19 before,
but I don't understand...

36
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,760
why everyone pretends to be fine
when I call them.

37
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,790
- Even when they're obviously ill.
- That's...

38
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,960
Look at me.

39
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,600
- They don't want to look weak.
- They don't want to look weak.

40
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,760
Se Chan said
it wasn't so bad this time.

41
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,430
- Right.
- That's a lie.

42
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,700
- Is it a lie?
- It almost killed me this time.

43
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,760
- Really? I didn't know that.
- He just pretended to be tough.

44
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,810
Anyway, we have things to celebrate.

45
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,710
- Of course.
- So...

46
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,270
- Thank you.
- Jae Suk did it again.

47
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,600
- Congratulations.
- I won the Grand Award.

48
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,820
I know. I was watching you.

49
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,070
Thank you.

50
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,350
(He won the Grand Award after
running hard in the year 2022.)

51
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,180
Thankfully, I won...

52
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,460
- my 19th Grand Award.
- That's crazy.

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,660
- This is really crazy.
- I said this as a joke.

54
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,520
"Are you going to win
the Grand Award 20 times?"

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,870
- And it will probably happen.
- He did say that.

56
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,900
It will happen this year.

57
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,400
If things go well,
it will really happen.

58
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,870
Actually, now that it's already like this,
I should try hard this year.

59
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,710
- Let's make it 20 times.
- You win the award this year...

60
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,710
and retire next year.

61
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,900
- What are you talking about?
- After winning 20 Grand Awards,

62
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,970
you just quit.

63
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,520
Why would you say
something so awful?

64
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,090
- Just leave.
- No way.

65
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,020
I'm too young to retire yet.

66
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,590
You promised you'd leave
at the age of 60.

67
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,180
- Right.
- I'm not 60 yet.

68
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,180
- You should do that.
- So...

69
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,360
Like I said that day,

70
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,520
it means that Running Man
won the Grand Award.

71
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,060
- That's what I believe. So...
- All right.

72
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,430
you can keep the trophy
for a week each.

73
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,930
- In turn?
- Like a tour.

74
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,710
- Are you serious?
- And...

75
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,110
we will decide
who will inherit the trophy later.

76
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,210
So I'll get it in six weeks.

77
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,050
- You can take it first.
- Can I go first?

78
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,370
I'll be the last one to go.

79
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,240
You also won the Best Couple Award
with Jong Kook.

80
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,440
That's right.

81
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,520
- That's amazing.
- That's true.

82
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
(The Grand Award Duo won
the Best Couple Award together.)

83
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,090
Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Jong Kook.
Congratulations.

84
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,720
(Their sweet and brutal chemistry
was finally recognized by SBS.)

85
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,930
(Lifting)

86
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,300
- It finally paid off.
- Seriously, I...

87
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,530
- I didn't see this coming.
- This is something new to me.

88
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,460
- I was surprised.
- Have you won...

89
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,530
- the Best Couple Award before?
- What?

90
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,560
- The Best Couple Award.
- No.

91
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,930
- No?
- It was his first time.

92
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,400
- I won the Best Rookie Award...
- He's like Messi.

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,150
- He wins all kinds of awards.
- You're so greedy.

94
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,580
- You're Messi.
- My gosh.

95
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,970
One thing came to another,
and I ended up...

96
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,180
winning all the awards.

97
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,420
Now you need to win
the Son and Daughter of SBS Award.

98
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,120
- No.
- That's the only thing left.

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
I was really surprised.
The Son and Daughter of SBS Award?

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,830
Rather than
the Son and Daughter of SBS Award...

101
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,720
I want to win...

102
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,190
- the Best Couple Award with Ji Hyo.
- I want it too.

103
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,990
- What are you doing?
- What is she doing? Hey.

104
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,090
- The Best Couple Award.
- That's not...

105
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,900
- how you win the Best Couple Award.
- Not that kind of couple.

106
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,640
It shouldn't be
so contrived like that.

107
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,610
You should show your affection
in a natural way.

108
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,900
- Jong Kook and I...
- Hey.

109
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,110
Do you think you two look natural?

110
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,970
- Of course, we do.
- We're natural.

111
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,940
- We look natural.
- We really mean it.

112
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,420
- He's Messi.
- To celebrate the New Year,

113
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,650
we prepared a new race
with a fresh heart.

114
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,590
It's called Running Man Outing Race.

115
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,490
Running Man Outing.

116
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,620
The members of Running Man
will spend a whole day together.

117
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,250
It's like the old TV show,
"Family Outing."

118
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,190
- That's what Jong Kook and I did.
- Right.

119
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,670
It was a wild outdoor variety show.

120
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,630
Actually, Running Man is
a kind of outdoor variety show,

121
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,970
but Seok Sam has led
a sheltered life.

122
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,570
I haven't done this for a long time.

123
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,830
He isn't the type of person
who burns firewood.

124
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,180
Look at the size of my bag.

125
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,550
The size of my bag shows
that I don't know anything.

126
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,120
Those who did "Family Outing"...

127
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,810
- They are different.
- You might wonder...

128
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,490
why we'd need so much stuff
for an overnight trip.

129
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,810
- What's in it?
- But we brought...

130
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,750
a lot of thick clothes just in case.

131
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,380
- You have thick clothes in it?
- Yes.

132
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,530
You know what?

133
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,930
Do you know why I've been
in this field for 30 years?

134
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,530
- Why?
- I manage things...

135
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,100
so we won't have to stay outdoors.

136
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,040
We just need to win games.

137
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,970
- I don't think that's it.
- No?

138
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,670
- Isn't it like that?
- We don't know it yet.

139
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,200
- We're not playing games.
- Isn't it like the other TV show?

140
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,830
I didn't know...

141
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,910
Are you talking about things
like Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors?

142
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,940
- It's not like that.
- No?

143
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,370
(Stay tuned in.)

144
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,440
Since Se Chan is
joining us a little late,

145
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,010
we invited a guest
who's like a family member.

146
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,120
- Our family?
- A family member.

147
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,080
A guest who's like family?

148
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,620
- Family?
- Family.

149
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,750
A guest who's like family?

150
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,600
There's Long Legs.

151
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,390
- Hey, you're here.
- Come here.

152
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,870
- You've come a long way.
- We raised you.

153
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,430
- Right. You...
- Hi.

154
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,870
- Hello.
- Seriously.

155
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,870
It's true that he's like family.

156
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,110
- What?
- Like family.

157
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,240
- "What?"
- It's begun already.

158
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,810
- Just come here.
- I mean...

159
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,370
- That's how they introduced you.
- Come here.

160
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,370
- That's what they said.
- Hey, you...

161
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,810
- Gosh.
- Come here.

162
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,220
Now that you've got some money,
you're wearing expensive clothes.

163
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,560
- Hey, this is a luxury brand.
- This is expensive.

164
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,450
You're wearing designer clothes.

165
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,490
Don't wear it.
This doesn't suit our show.

166
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,890
I wear it only when I come here.

167
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,530
You will burn firewood later.

168
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,320
- You'll get holes in that.
- It will get ruined.

169
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,970
- It will get holes.
- You'll be chopping wood later.

170
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,040
I'll buy another one.

171
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
You didn't watch "Family Outing."
You'll get holes in your clothes.

172
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,170
We will make a fire in a fireplace.

173
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,260
- You'll make the fire.
- I can do anything...

174
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,000
as long as it's for Running Man.

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,200
By the way, you're...

176
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,000
Jong Kook, why are you
looking at him like that?

177
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,570
I think I've seen that look before.

178
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,850
- I have something to tell you.
- What?

179
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,680
Seriously... It's been...

180
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,180
- ten years since my debut.
- Okay.

181
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,220
It was my first time attending
the awards ceremonies this year.

182
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,930
You mean yesterday?

183
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,750
He came to the SBS Entertainment
Awards as a presenter.

184
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,690
- Right.
- And the first ceremony I joined...

185
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,600
was the SBS Entertainment Awards.

186
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,560
- So I went to present the award.
- And?

187
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,240
I went on stage to present
the award feeling happy.

188
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,330
- I danced as I showed up.
- Okay.

189
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,930
And the day before the ceremony,

190
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,370
I called Jong Kook...

191
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,910
to talk about Gym Jong Kook.

192
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,480
We had a talk the previous day,
so I...

193
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,680
The thing is... What was that?

194
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,740
- What are you trying to say?
- What is he saying?

195
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,380
- Hang on.
- What's with you?

196
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,060
- Let me finish.
- We already give you a chance.

197
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
- What I'm saying is...
- You had your chance.

198
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,660
- Hang on.
- You had your chance to talk.

199
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,320
(What Woo Jae is
trying to say is...)

200
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,970
(He showed up feeling all excited,)

201
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,190
(but his mind went blank
when he saw Jong Kook.)

202
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,500
So we booked a place
to stay tonight.

203
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,870
You'll get to the place in a van.

204
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,480
- Okay.
- All right.

205
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,240
Then you should've told Woo Jae
to come to the place.

206
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,280
- Just to say this.
- For the opening.

207
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,350
"Come to Yeouido."

208
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,010
He could've joined us
at the place instead.

209
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,790
He didn't have to come
all the way here.

210
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,920
- He needed to say hello.
- I see.

211
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,580
Let's go, Woo Jae.
Go and buy us some bread.

212
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,380
What I want to say is...

213
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,120
- Let's just go.
- Enough. Stop talking.

214
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,690
- Let's just go.
- So I went on stage.

215
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,890
Just go.

216
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,530
It's nice to have Woo Jae here.

217
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,470
- I like Woo Jae a lot.
- When Woo Jae is here...

218
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,370
It feels like we have
someone to rely on.

219
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,430
(Now they give him
a sincere welcome.)

220
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,870
But it's not like...

221
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,310
you're just happy to see me.

222
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,540
- I'm happy to see you.
- Okay.

223
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,040
What I like about Woo Jae is...

224
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,550
It's not like
I know a lot of models, but...

225
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,280
How should I put this?
Even when he's around,

226
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,780
I don't feel so small.

227
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,240
- I feel confident.
- Right.

228
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,510
- When Woo Jae is here...
- For some reason...

229
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,680
It's like...

230
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,810
That's subtle.

231
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,450
- I mean, I feel comfortable.
- He makes me confident.

232
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,490
Right.

233
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,290
- It's not like he's superior.
- I mean...

234
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,990
- I feel comfortable around him.
- I don't believe this.

235
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,530
He's like a bad example
of a good-looking model.

236
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,930
- Seriously... I mean...
- Where's the bread?

237
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,130
- What?
- Where's the bread?

238
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,500
Over there.

239
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,240
I have to make sure.
That's what Se Chan does.

240
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,410
Actually,

241
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,870
she thinks of Se Chan
as her boyfriend.

242
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,280
- I miss Se Chan.
- When she's tired,

243
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,810
she says she misses Se Chan.

244
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,810
- She's really funny.
- And Se Chan...

245
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,120
I miss Se Chan.

246
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,880
- Actually, Se Chan is...
- He's thoughtful.

247
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,880
Unlike how he looks...

248
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,380
Why would you mention his looks?

249
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,980
Anyway, Se Chan is not
like how he looks.

250
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,160
- Se Chan is unbelievable.
- He's modest.

251
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,300
- I know.
- He's popular.

252
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,770
- And he has high standards.
- Women find him attractive.

253
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,820
- Right.
- It's crazy.

254
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,360
- Se Chan is...
- He's really attractive.

255
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,830
- I get that a lot.
- It's important...

256
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,560
It's important to have
your own charms.

257
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,170
A lot of people said
that I was attractive.

258
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,040
You were even good-looking before.

259
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,730
- Right. I really was.
- You were charming.

260
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,550
- I was kind of lovely.
- Right.

261
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,570
And you're funny.

262
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,150
And you're sophisticated.

263
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,210
- I have my own charms.
- Haha was...

264
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,920
He was handsome when he was Z-KIRI.

265
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,810
Why can't you say anything
at a time like this?

266
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,920
I was going to say something.

267
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,260
- He was just...
- Why can't you say anything?

268
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,530
He was just... Gosh.

269
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,820
(Speechless)

270
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,690
Before he became popular,
he was a mess.

271
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,160
(Before he became popular,
he was a mess.)

272
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,360
- Seriously, he was...
- Was he lonely?

273
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,190
He was totally lonely.

274
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,170
You know, I've known
Suk Jin for a long time.

275
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,410
He was like...

276
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,970
When women saw him...

277
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,180
It's not like women liked him a lot.

278
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,340
- He kept talking until it worked.
- Until they liked him.

279
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,470
- He and I...
- He never stopped talking.

280
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,250
- We just kept talking.
- Actually,

281
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,710
he's the type of person
who could be popular in the 1990s.

282
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,680
Suk Jin wore a striped shirt
and white pants, right?

283
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,390
- Exactly. You know that, right?
- It looks good on you.

284
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,180
- I saw you at a nightclub.
- Right.

285
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,030
He looks sophisticated,
even during that time.

286
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,630
- I saw him.
- Right.

287
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,630
My waiter served your table too.

288
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,000
- Really?
- So I saw you.

289
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,690
I saw Jae Suk
open the door and shout,

290
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,770
"I picked up some girls!"

291
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,910
- Are you serious?
- That never happened.

292
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,280
Do you think I'd do that?

293
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,200
That's not what I'd do.

294
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,550
(While they have a friendly talk
in the New Year,)

295
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,700
What was really funny was...

296
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,380
(they arrive at a snowy village
in Yangpyeong.)

297
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,810
Let's go in.

298
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,810
Let's go.

299
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,980
- This is nice.
- All right.

300
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,720
- This looks good.
- It's been a long time.

301
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,500
I like the smell of firewood.

302
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,640
- Let's go in.
- This is a sunny place.

303
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,770
This is very nice.

304
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,810
Come here.

305
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,860
So there's no mission.
We just stay here.

306
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,930
- This is...
- Okay.

307
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,470
- My bag is...
- Gosh.

308
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,570
Gosh.

309
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,380
The front yard is still
covered with snow.

310
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,520
Woo Jae, you should
shovel the snow later.

311
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,680
This is nice.

312
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,290
- Woo Jae.
- Yes.

313
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,560
(Leaping)

314
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,110
You should shovel the snow.

315
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,260
(She starts running around.)

316
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,590
She's excited to see the snow.

317
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,670
(It's a disease that she wants
to crunch through the snow.)

318
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,630
- She seems excited.
- That's...

319
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,330
You know So Min, right?

320
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,140
She will get exhausted soon.

321
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,330
"Jae Suk, I'm so tired."

322
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,570
- This is really nice.
- My gosh.

323
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,600
- We have this thing.
- What?

324
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,840
This one doesn't work.

325
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,750
- No. Let me try. This is...
- That doesn't work.

326
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,150
- We have a snowman "machine."
- I can't make snowballs.

327
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,180
- It's done.
- So it works.

328
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,680
- It's done.
- It's done.

329
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,180
I did it.

330
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,680
(She makes a snowman
with childhood innocence.)

331
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,580
- Yes! I did it.
- It's a snowman.

332
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,660
Come on, Suk Jin.

333
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,160
- We should get a fire going.
- When people...

334
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,660
come to a place like this,

335
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,800
do they usually do this?

336
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,540
- Isn't this unnatural?
- What?

337
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,590
Making snowmen.

338
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,190
- I think this is natural.
- It was here.

339
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,540
- I saw it here.
- Do we do this?

340
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,170
- Of course.
- It fell over.

341
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,780
My boots finally get to shine.

342
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,010
- Hey.
- Gosh.

343
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,180
(He's wearing his favorite boots.)

344
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,470
This place is nice.

345
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,610
- My goodness.
- What?

346
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,810
- What do we do?
- Look at this.

347
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,290
We have sweet potatoes
and corn here to cook up.

348
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,680
This is really nice.

349
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,610
- It's so clean.
- This is nice.

350
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,060
- It looks warm in here.
- It's perfect.

351
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,890
(The members are impressed
by the kitchen.)

352
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,260
This is really nice.

353
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,900
- Woo Jae.
- Yes.

354
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,320
Hey, guys. Scoop some soup.

355
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,460
(This place is where
Woo Jae and Seok Sam will work.)

356
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,830
- Look at this!
- This is really good.

357
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,830
We will sleep in here.

358
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,960
Where do we sleep?

359
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,830
- This is where we sleep.
- It looks pretty.

360
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,700
- The room is nice.
- It's good. It's so cozy.

361
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,440
It must be warm.

362
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,780
Clapping your hands

363
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,550
(This is where they will have fun
and sleep together.)

364
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,940
This is really nice.

365
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,150
This is nice.

366
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,580
It's nice here.

367
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,760
- No way. What's this?
- This place is great.

368
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,980
- This place...
- It's nice and clean.

369
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,160
- What's this room?
- Inside, it's...

370
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,560
- It's a modern setup.
- It's crazy.

371
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,580
- Really?
- Exactly.

372
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,220
This place is amazing.

373
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,430
It's what you'd find at a hotel.

374
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,130
Take a look.

375
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,460
- Gosh.
- What...

376
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,560
(Crash)

377
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,960
Woo Jae, my suitcase!

378
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,430
I bet you did that on purpose.

379
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,070
Woo Jae, my suitcase!

380
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,570
(The paper doll got blown away
along with the suitcases.)

381
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,050
- He wanted that to happen.
- Woo Jae, seriously?

382
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,180
Hey!

383
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,790
Don't force things.

384
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,150
You made it seem too obvious.

385
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,650
- Did he do something funny?
- Yes.

386
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,820
Those of you who haven't been on
"Family Outing" wouldn't know.

387
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,180
- I don't.
- But take your suitcases in first.

388
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,800
- Woo Jae, take them inside.
- Where?

389
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,860
- The girls and boys...
- This room must be for sleeping.

390
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
- Will we be in the same room?
- Probably in separate rooms.

391
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,540
- Only this one will be warm though.
- Really?

392
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,560
- Yes.
- Got it.

393
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,200
- In the same room?
- On "Family Outing,"

394
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,830
everyone bunked together.

395
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,930
- Suk Jin.
- Do we only get one room?

396
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,200
I doubt sleep will come to me.

397
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,880
- You'll be knocked out.
- I bet someone will snore.

398
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,410
- We should get some sleep.
- Who's a snorer?

399
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,550
- Me.
- Probably everyone.

400
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,710
Some will snore
and some will grit their teeth.

401
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,050
- And some will talk in their sleep.
- I snore severely when I'm tired.

402
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,130
Like I informed you earlier,
this is the Running Man Outing Race.

403
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,320
Cameras will film you
for 24 hours...

404
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,060
- while you have fun at this house.
- For 24 hours?

405
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,270
The current time is 11 a.m.,

406
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,090
so the race will end
tomorrow at 11 a.m.

407
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,400
Really?

408
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,170
So that you receive good energy...

409
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,910
as we begin 2023,
the Year of the Black Rabbit,

410
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,880
we have prepared
a gold rabbit of 3.75g.

411
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,100
- Really?
- A rabbit?

412
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,780
On the wheel, your names...

413
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,050
will take up a space
following a specific rule.

414
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,580
The wheel will be spun tomorrow.

415
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,060
The chosen three people
will win the gold.

416
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,080
We must be playing games
or something.

417
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,350
Being 1 out of 3 is doable.

418
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,760
- I agree.
- I think so too.

419
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,720
The wheel will be spun three times.

420
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,320
However,
one can be chosen three times...

421
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,400
- and win all the gold.
- Really?

422
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,190
No way. Don't get your hopes up
because I won't be sharing...

423
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,960
- if the gold ends up as mine.
- I'm excited about this.

424
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,040
Since you're here, for 24 hours,

425
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,070
you will be cooking for yourselves.

426
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,550
However, you must make
what was chosen in advance.

427
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,650
- We don't get to choose.
- Lunch and dinner for today...

428
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,250
and breakfast for tomorrow.

429
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,110
For lunch, you will make
a simple bowl of janchi guksu.

430
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,520
In what world
is janchi guksu a simple dish?

431
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,260
- It's actually easy.
- It's easy to make.

432
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,680
- All we need is anchovy broth.
- It's easier than you think.

433
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,260
- We'll do it in no time.
- I'll take charge.

434
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,320
It's even better with some ramyeon.

435
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,960
- The noodles don't work.
- We need to make...

436
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,130
- pickled radish.
- Hear me out.

437
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,900
- Janchi guksu with ramyeon.
- But I want spicy fish stew.

438
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,910
- I bet you haven't had it together.
- I haven't.

439
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,540
We need pickled radish
to have with janchi guksu.

440
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,570
For dinner, you will have
pork belly and budaejjigae.

441
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,070
- That stew is my favorite.
- Budaejjigae...

442
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,920
- It's the best.
- What a bummer.

443
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,580
Must we make it though?

444
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,390
Yes, you must also build
a stove too.

445
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,260
- Just mix everything in.
- It's not that hard.

446
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,580
Shouldn't we be making
chueotang at least?

447
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,760
Would you like to make that?

448
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,300
On "Family Outing,"
I caught the loach myself...

449
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,430
- and ground it up to make soup.
- Stay put, will you?

450
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,640
- Don't you remember that?
- Gosh.

451
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,100
- You caught the loach yourself?
- Yes.

452
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,330
I can't believe it.

453
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,310
Here we go. It's working.

454
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,780
(It turned out to be true.)

455
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,680
Tomorrow morning,
you will have tteokguk...

456
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,650
- to celebrate the new year.
- Tteokguk's easy.

457
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,150
- I...
- We only need beef bone soup.

458
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,250
It's exhausting.

459
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,710
You're giving us too much work.

460
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,180
- Both So Min and Ji Hyo...
- It's all right.

461
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,680
- are good at cooking though.
- They're good cooks.

462
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,430
I'm terrible at cooking,

463
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,450
- but So Min's good at it.
- So Min's a good cook.

464
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,590
Se Chan is good at cooking,

465
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,400
- but he'll be here at noon.
- Stop talking about him will you?

466
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,560
Are you talking
about your boyfriend?

467
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,770
He's a good cook.

468
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,560
We can get it done too.

469
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,060
- Of course.
- We'll be able to manage.

470
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,700
The ramyeon seasoning
makes everything taste good.

471
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,860
Seriously?

472
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,510
Also, while cooking...

473
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,410
(His blind faith
in ramyeon seasoning...)

474
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,570
(began during his days
on "Family Outing.")

475
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,570
Gosh, it's hot.

476
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
What on earth?

477
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,310
(He added ramyeon seasoning
to every dish...)

478
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,850
(which solidified his love
for the sachet.)

479
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,480
You will be shopping
for groceries as well.

480
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
- Groceries?
- Yes.

481
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,190
Since you said that So Min
was the best cook among you...

482
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,630
I can't say I'm that good.

483
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,670
Please choose
who you want to go shopping with.

484
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,400
- Me?
- You can count on me.

485
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Are we shopping
just for the janchi guksu...

486
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,810
- or everything else?
- And the budaejjigae.

487
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,510
- Don't forget the ramyeon.
- Ramyeon?

488
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,510
And pork belly.

489
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,280
Get ready to shop
for groceries then...

490
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,410
and choose a partner.

491
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,180
I choose Haha and Woo Jae.

492
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,210
Those staying behind
will build a stove...

493
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,790
- and cook the broth.
- We need a stove.

494
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,290
Jae Suk and Jong Kook,
show us how it's done.

495
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,760
- Sure.
- Do you have money?

496
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,980
- Let's go grocery shopping.
- Let's go.

497
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,790
- Sit up front, Woo Jae.
- Are you in the back?

498
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,350
You and Haha can sit in that row.

499
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,930
We need to remember
to buy onions and zucchini.

500
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,140
- Sausages and spam.
- Right.

501
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,060
- And also bacon.
- Pork, beef, and bacon are needed.

502
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,360
- We need minced meat, kimchi,
- That's right.

503
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,170
- and baked beans.
- Did you know that...

504
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,210
- the recipes vary in regions?
- I like the Uijeongbu style.

505
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,050
They can be different.
One uses a clear broth while...

506
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,840
I like the kind
that adds baked beans.

507
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,310
Let's not make it
too hard on ourselves.

508
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,310
- Beef bone soup and...
- To that, we'll add the tteok.

509
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,110
We also need pepper.

510
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,730
And tteok.

511
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,030
Should we add tofu
in the budaejjigae?

512
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,230
They sell homemade ones around here.

513
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,650
It won't be budaejjigae
without tofu.

514
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,270
- And tofu.
- Homemade tofu?

515
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,770
- Nearby?
- Yes, there's a shop nearby.

516
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,470
We'll get tofu
that has just been made.

517
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,970
Doesn't it sound delicious?
Why don't we eat one?

518
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,860
Must you even ask?

519
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,710
- Homemade tofu?
- That's right.

520
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,370
I love homemade tofu.

521
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,950
I was excited to know that
Se Chan would be cooking for us.

522
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,050
- He's quite the cook.
- He's good at it.

523
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,110
- Se Chan.
- Hey.

524
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,380
- When will you get here?
- Is that Se Chan?

525
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,260
I'll arrive in the evening.

526
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,380
In the evening? We're going
grocery shopping right now.

527
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,730
Do you need anything?

528
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,230
How sweet of her.

529
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,580
There's nothing I need.

530
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,730
Well...

531
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,970
- Se Chan, hey.
- Yes?

532
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,320
So Min must want to be good to you
since Woo Jae's here.

533
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,000
Se Chan, it's Woo Jae.

534
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,330
- Hey, Woo Jae.
- So Min wants you here badly.

535
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,480
- Is that so?
- But only when I'm present.

536
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,070
- Exactly.
- Only when I'm present.

537
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,900
- That's not it. Woo Jae...
- I'm jealous, guys.

538
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,410
- Yes?
- As you know, he's the youngest.

539
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,610
- Love with all your heart.
- Right.

540
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,950
But he hasn't been doing
what the youngest member should do.

541
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,410
In what year did she debut?

542
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,190
- I don't know.
- I debuted 18 years ago.

543
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,150
I've been in the industry
for 18 years.

544
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,580
- Eighteen years?
- Yes.

545
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,460
(He ate a big slice of humble pie.)

546
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,560
How would you like
fried ribs for dinner?

547
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,060
- Fried ribs?
- Yes.

548
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,660
I don't know if the grocery store
would have back ribs.

549
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,330
- Really?
- Right.

550
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,360
(During the short break they took)

551
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,540
In 1, 2, 3.

552
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,280
You can get ripe kimchi
at the supermarket.

553
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,050
- It's good.
- Put that in a pot...

554
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,810
- And just boil it?
- With a huge chunk of pork,

555
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,910
- boil it for two hours.
- That will be good.

556
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,460
If we go on an overnight trip,
we'll buy the pork and...

557
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,810
- I'll make it for you.
- Sure.

558
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,260
Suk Jin, you'll be blown away.

559
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,150
- By what?
- Braised kimchi with back ribs.

560
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,620
That sounds delicious.

561
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,800
(Se Chan promised
to blow them away.)

562
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,360
Call me once you get there.

563
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,530
Sure.

564
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,330
Would they have back ribs though?

565
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,040
- Se Chan offered to fry them.
- But...

566
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,540
First...

567
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,170
We should stack these first.

568
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,040
- We should put gloves on.
- How should it be done?

569
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,640
Where should we build the stove?

570
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,640
Let's start with a single layer.

571
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,050
There's a lot to do
at places like this.

572
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,840
Why is there so much to do?

573
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,840
This is why I love
staying in hotels.

574
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,290
Right?

575
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,580
Rotate them at an angle
so that there's room for air.

576
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,820
Doesn't air need to flow?

577
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,030
Yes, that's why we need
an opening too.

578
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,590
Good.

579
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,860
We never made a stove
on "Family Outing" though.

580
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,210
- This wasn't our job.
- I can't believe we're making one.

581
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,770
We can always cook...

582
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,370
- on a portable gas stove.
- Exactly.

583
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,600
- Why must we be primitive?
- Why must we cook on a fire?

584
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,370
- There are nice stoves out there.
- This is such a cliche.

585
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,950
A cliche in variety shows.

586
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,410
Unbelievable.

587
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,880
Make some room between the blocks.

588
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,410
That's the issue we have though.

589
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,790
- Make some room like so.
- We do it all while complaining.

590
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,290
Everything we must do
is a task on its own.

591
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,530
- One would think we'd give up.
- Working in silence is no fun.

592
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,620
- Like us...
- Jae Suk.

593
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,660
- Coming.
- Yes?

594
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,270
- One must complain.
- Why are you making another one?

595
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,940
Gosh, thanks.

596
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,900
- What are you making?
- We were told to make two stoves.

597
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,940
Two stoves?

598
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,540
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

599
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,570
Hold on a second.

600
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,110
We can make the stew
after grilling the meat.

601
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,250
We can cook the rice on a gas stove.

602
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,690
But rice tastes better
when cooked in a big iron pot.

603
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,460
- A big iron pot?
- Hyung In.

604
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,190
Do you cook rice at home
in a big iron pot?

605
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,320
- I bet she doesn't.
- Jae Suk, here.

606
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,350
Right.

607
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,390
Why are you only bringing me
two at a time?

608
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,200
They aren't that heavy, you know.

609
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,500
- Here are four.
- Gosh.

610
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,000
(He delivers four bricks this time.)

611
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,540
(Humming)

612
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,100
He's pretending to be happy.

613
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,600
- I'm trying to get myself excited.
- Come on.

614
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,170
There was nothing natural about it.

615
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,670
- Don't pretend to be happy.
- This is a first for him,

616
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,720
- so it's not fun for him.
- I'm trying to get myself excited.

617
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,810
Those watching are the ones
that should be having fun.

618
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,150
Our time on "Family Outing"
wasn't all for nothing.

619
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,650
There's something else
other than the pot.

620
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,580
Wait. The pot should fit in that.

621
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,800
It won't fit.

622
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,200
- Where?
- Hey.

623
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,160
- The pot...
- What's wrong?

624
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,000
(Seok Sam claims
that the pot won't fit.)

625
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,390
It only has to cover the hole.

626
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,390
I doubt it's big enough.

627
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,660
Won't it sit on the stove?

628
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,060
(Groaning)

629
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,240
Take it, will you?

630
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,050
- Let's lift it together.
- All right. Hold it here.

631
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,840
The pot has to fit on this?

632
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,570
It should,
but I doubt it's big enough.

633
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,520
The upper layer should be removed.

634
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,020
Hold on a second. No, it'll fit.

635
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,910
It'll fit. There you go.
Lift it up again.

636
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,650
- That's good enough.
- We're good.

637
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,420
I see your time on "Family Outing"
wasn't for nothing.

638
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,090
- We're experts, Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin.

639
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,300
It has enough holes
for air to flow as well.

640
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,420
Gosh, it didn't even take long.

641
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,440
- We're experts.
- Make it bigger.

642
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,470
- Here.
- It doesn't even take us that long.

643
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,510
- Jong Kook and I...
- Right.

644
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,830
It's nice to have people
who have done this before.

645
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,310
- That's a good bottom layer.
- Should we light a fire, then?

646
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,340
- Hold on a second.
- There are briquettes here.

647
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,910
We have a torch, briquettes,
and everything else we need.

648
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,110
This is nice.

649
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,410
- We experts can tell by the sound.
- Yes.

650
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,810
- You call yourself an expert?
- It's dry enough.

651
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,150
It burns well when it's dry.
Or else, it smokes a lot.

652
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,060
We should put this
on top of the briquettes, right?

653
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,620
- Give me that. We can use a torch.
- Briquettes? Right.

654
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,800
Right. Give me the torch.

655
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,420
But we don't have gas.

656
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,420
I know where it is.

657
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,890
- We don't have gas?
- We have a torch here...

658
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,590
- Hey.
- What are you talking about?

659
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,940
- Anyone from "Family Outing"...
- But gas...

660
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,240
- knows where it would be.
- But we don't have gas.

661
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Do we have gas?

662
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,710
He really is an expert.
He knows where to find stuff.

663
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,010
- Of course.
- He found it.

664
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,050
- We've done it on "Family Outing."
- He knows everything.

665
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,070
- I couldn't have found it.
- I know.

666
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,050
- We have two experts here.
- It's easy as they have experience.

667
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,990
This is so great.
Everything is going so smoothly.

668
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,850
- It's great.
- It's easy, Suk Jin.

669
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,000
Maybe you should adjust it.
Okay, it's done. Go ahead.

670
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,530
- My, look at that.
- Okay.

671
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,470
(Surprised)

672
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,500
Suk Jin, don't play with fire.
You'll pee yourself in your sleep.

673
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,510
Only those with a healthy prostate
like us should do this.

674
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,540
- Right. A healthy prostate.
- Hey.

675
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,070
- You should be able to control it.
- Hey.

676
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,570
- You need a healthy prostate.
- Yes.

677
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,870
- Come on.
- Don't do anything with fire.

678
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,910
It's like concrete.

679
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,990
- Never play with fire.
- My prostate is healthy.

680
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,380
Suk Jin had to go to the restroom
several times during the ceremony.

681
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,460
- You need a healthy prostate.
- Absolutely.

682
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,560
It's fun to make a fire, you know.

683
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,800
- Really?
- It's really fun.

684
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,820
What's so fun about it?

685
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,160
You have to pay attention
to keep the fire burning.

686
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,660
It feels like raising a child.
That's how it feels.

687
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,390
It's not different from
setting paper on fire.

688
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,970
No, you're wrong. It's different.

689
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:52,980
(But the firewood
isn't catching on fire.)

690
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,240
Is it supposed to be upside down?
The bottom part catches fire fast.

691
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,340
- We have a fan, Jae Suk.
- Let's put some paper under it.

692
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,400
- And on top of it...
- Right. Do that.

693
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,980
- Crumple a few sheets for me.
- Okay.

694
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,250
You can just throw the newspaper
in it.

695
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,610
- No, that's not how it works.
- No. That won't help.

696
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,610
We know this from our experience
on "Family Outing."

697
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,880
- My goodness.
- Yes, that's good. Okay.

698
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,990
- Good. That's enough.
- Hey.

699
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,790
You keep bragging about
your experience from the show.

700
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,090
- Make sure there's enough air.
- Yes.

701
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,560
- You're right.
- Suk Jin, come here.

702
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,890
Suk Jin, come and help me
crumple the paper.

703
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,660
You don't have to do that.

704
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,860
Just tear it and put it in here.

705
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,540
- No. It doesn't work like that.
- No, Suk Jin.

706
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,240
- Just tear it and put it in here.
- No.

707
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,540
(It doesn't work like that.)

708
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,370
- It still catches fire.
- If you don't crumple it,

709
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,570
- it doesn't help to start the fire.
- What role does kindling play?

710
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,910
As it burns, the fire comes upward.

711
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,080
This doesn't help do anything!

712
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,140
- Oh, I see.
- Hey, wait.

713
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,790
- Put the cauldron on here now.
- You use kindling... Wait. Stop it.

714
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,080
- Jae Suk, it's crazy in there.
- Yes?

715
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,580
- Oh, no. This is bad.
- You should've crumpled it.

716
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,730
- This is why you shouldn't do this.
- Hang on.

717
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,060
How about we cover it with this?

718
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,620
No.
Bring the cauldron and put it on.

719
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,740
(They start fanning the fire.)

720
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,440
- My gosh. I can't believe...
- Oh, man.

721
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,360
In front of you... Ji Hyo.

722
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,940
- I knew it. Why did you...
- I'm sorry.

723
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,740
Ji Hyo, bring the cauldron.

724
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,210
- I'm sorry, Jae Suk.
- I told you not to do that.

725
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,840
(Seok Sam's newspaper flower bloomed
in an instant.)

726
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,640
- It's snowing! Look at the snow!
- Please don't do that.

727
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,350
(The smoky snowflakes)

728
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,520
- Stop fanning!
- Hey, it's snowing.

729
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,060
(Heavy snow falls unexpectedly.)

730
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,920
- I told you not to do that.
- Give me that, Suk Jin.

731
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,200
Suk Jin, give me that.

732
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,120
- It's snowing!
- If this keeps up,

733
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,740
the ground will get all sooty.

734
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,040
- Why did you fan the fire?
- Jong Kook, move aside.

735
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,510
- I put a lot of firewood here too.
- Hey, wait.

736
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,870
- We shouldn't put it on there yet.
- No, we should do it now.

737
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:46,940
(Jae Suk moves the cauldron
to solve the problem.)

738
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,450
We shouldn't keep it empty
on the fire. Let's add some water.

739
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,250
Seok Sam, can you bring some water?

740
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,220
Water? I can use this basin.

741
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,250
I'll do it.

742
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,960
And then...

743
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,960
(Let me see.)

744
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,620
I met Ji Hyo for the first time
when she came on "Family Outing."

745
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,230
You're right. That's when I met you
for the first time.

746
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,090
Oh, I don't have to take this
over there.

747
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,770
(Grunting)

748
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,770
(He's having a 1-on-1 battle
against the hose.)

749
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,940
(It's not an easy opponent for him.)

750
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,370
What is Suk Jin doing?

751
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,280
How do I do this?

752
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,310
Ji Hyo,
you shouldn't do it halfheartedly.

753
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,380
- Sorry. I was looking at Suk Jin.
- Ji Hyo.

754
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,310
What is Seok Sam doing?

755
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,310
(Seok Sam catches everyone's eye.)

756
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,790
- Ji Hyo, keep doing it.
- Okay, Jae Suk.

757
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,920
We have to split the firewood
to make it burn well.

758
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,300
Hey, can you... The lid...

759
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,620
Can you open the lid for me, Ji Hyo?

760
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,300
- We shouldn't keep it empty.
- We shouldn't do that.

761
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,940
(It took him ten minutes
to bring water.)

762
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,660
- It's okay as we have butane gas.
- It smells bad.

763
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,900
Why did you fill only a third
of the basin?

764
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,510
We just need to keep the cauldron
from being empty.

765
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,250
- It's not easy starting a fire.
- It's burning well.

766
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,520
- It's a lot of work, Jae Suk.
- Indeed.

767
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,340
It must be hard for our cameramen.
The smoke is going toward them.

768
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,220
Look at them.
They don't care about it.

769
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,760
The smoke is going that way,
not toward us.

770
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
That's a relief though.

771
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,960
- What did you say?
- Suk Jin.

772
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,470
- Why did you go back on your word?
- Which one did you mean?

773
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,360
How many personalities do you have?

774
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,890
Now, I'm regretting what I said.

775
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,770
It's burning well.
I did a great job.

776
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,130
Nice. You made a proper fire.

777
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,480
(The strong one finished
starting a fire.)

778
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
- Right?
- Yes.

779
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,280
My, this is nice, Suk Jin.
Look at that.

780
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,100
You would have a blast if you were
alone with your girlfriend.

781
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,250
Of course, I would have so much fun.

782
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,250
- Right?
- Yes, of course.

783
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,640
Your girlfriend would be sitting
over there, right?

784
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,050
- Reading a book.
- She'd be sitting on my lap.

785
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,560
(Chuckling)

786
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,190
He's such a sweet guy,
but he's still single.

787
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,920
- He's so sweet but lives alone.
- Oh, man.

788
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,800
- I pictured it, and it was gross.
- Gosh.

789
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,830
I'd let my girlfriend sit on my lap
the whole time. Don't be ridiculous.

790
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,470
- Really? But be careful.
- Yes.

791
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,900
- If you marry her,
- Yes.

792
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,900
you'd have to keep letting her
sit on your lap.

793
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,740
- That won't be a problem.
- Can you do that?

794
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,050
- Of course.
- It'd be exhausting.

795
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,670
- That's why I work out.
- I'm impressed.

796
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,910
He works out hard so that he can let
his girlfriend sit on his lap.

797
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,250
- That's romantic.
- Of course.

798
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,880
It's very comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting on my lap?

799
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,880
No, I'll pass.

800
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,760
- Woo Jae, take this shopping bag.
- Yes?

801
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,090
- Here's our shopping bag.
- Give it to me.

802
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,000
- Then first...
- Let's go.

803
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,530
- Well... Let's eat something.
- I'll carry it.

804
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,360
- Sorry?
- What shall we eat?

805
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,440
(They plan to have snacks
before shopping.)

806
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,540
I heard there were
a lot of famous places here.

807
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,330
- Haha. That sikhye looks good.
- Yes?

808
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,330
- Oh, my. It looks good.
- Shall we buy some?

809
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,510
- Let's pick it up on our way back.
- Let's do that...

810
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,750
- since it's heavy.
- How much money can we spend?

811
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,900
- As much money as we want.
- No limit?

812
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,780
- Shall we buy everything?
- Let's buy everything we want.

813
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,580
I can't sleep
without a particular type of pillow.

814
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,990
They sell blankets too.

815
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,020
- Se Chan said to buy pork belly...
- Yes?

816
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,150
- and another part...
- We should buy pork belly.

817
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,380
- Meat.
- Pork belly and minced meat.

818
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,560
- He told me to buy minced meat too.
- Yes. Let's buy a lot of meat. Hey.

819
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,850
How about
we eat homemade tofu first?

820
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,650
- Shall we? We can buy meat later.
- Shall we eat first?

821
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,200
- Let's eat first.
- And back ribs.

822
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,130
- How much do we need?
- I expected to go to a supermarket.

823
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,660
There's a supermarket too
as far as I know.

824
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,830
There's a supermarket too.

825
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,540
- Haha, look at those donuts.
- Hello.

826
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,540
- It must be a famous place.
- It's famous.

827
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,950
- Those dumplings look so tasty.
- Let's try some.

828
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,250
- It looks good. Oh, croquettes.
- Hello.

829
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

830
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,480
- Let's buy some twisted donuts.
- Hello.

831
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,490
What shall we buy?

832
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,020
Can we get...

833
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,020
- Hello.
- nine twisted donuts...

834
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,960
and dumplings...

835
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,960
Let's not buy any dumplings
since we have to cook.

836
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
- Okay. Then can we get nine...
- Our dumplings are the best.

837
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,470
- Pardon?
- Dumplings are our specialty.

838
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,000
- Please give us dumplings too.
- Okay.

839
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,270
(He ordered dumplings too
without thinking.)

840
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,160
- Half and half, please.
- Yes, half and half, please.

841
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,940
Can I have one of these, Haha?

842
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,240
- Just one croquette?
- Sure. Go ahead.

843
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,770
Eat whatever you can eat here.

844
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,780
Excuse me. Can I have one croquette?

845
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,570
Then I'll have salty and sweet food.
Can I have one chapsal donut?

846
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,870
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

847
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,050
Would you like
one with red bean paste?

848
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,340
Yes, of course.

849
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,460
- It's so good.
- Would you like sugar over it?

850
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,760
Of course, I'd like that.

851
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,850
- Thank you. Oh, my.
- Goodbye.

852
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,790
- It looks so good.
- It looks good, indeed.

853
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,000
How does it taste, Haha?

854
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,660
Is it good?

855
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
Is it sweet?

856
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,090
It's so chewy and nice.

857
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,830
Try it. Is it good?

858
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,940
(Meanwhile, the small eater doesn't
look like he's enjoying the food.)

859
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,900
- It's chewy and nice.
- I like the oily smell of a market.

860
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,670
- My, look at those dumplings.
- Look at the dumplings.

861
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,950
Oh, my. They look so tasty.

862
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,140
- It looks so good.
- Can I try one?

863
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,640
- Since we use fresh vegetables,
- Thank you.

864
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,250
the vegetables are still crisp.

865
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
It's too hot.

866
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,960
Look at this. It's full of filling.

867
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,030
It has a texture that I've never
tried before. I'm not lying.

868
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,820
How can a steamed dumpling have
a crunchy texture like this?

869
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,500
I swear. I'm not lying.

870
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,600
I swear on three generations
of my family. It's crunchy.

871
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,100
- Can I try one with kimchi too?
- Sure.

872
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,100
- It's really good.
- I'm impressed.

873
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,250
Was this originally
a dumpling place?

874
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,480
Was it changed to a donut place?

875
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,220
You crave salty food after eating
sweet food, and vice versa. Amazing.

876
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,520
I could stand here all night long,
eating everything they make.

877
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,380
- It's so good.
- Are we doing a product placement?

878
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,020
- Sorry? No.
- Are we doing a product placement?

879
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,350
(Haha's excessive reaction made him
think it was a product placement.)

880
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,700
- It's really tasty.
- I'm eating this dumpling... Hey.

881
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,000
- You're just like my second son.
- Are you still eating that?

882
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,120
- Who?
- You.

883
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,040
- You're full, right?
- My son is a reluctant eater too.

884
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
It's really good.

885
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,660
- You mean, So Wool?
- Yes.

886
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,440
I see that it's a bad idea
to wear an expensive jacket.

887
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,980
- Exactly.
- Because of sparks from the fire.

888
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,100
It's really good.

889
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,900
It's burning well.
You don't have to worry about it.

890
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,610
You've done a great job
in raising your child.

891
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,840
Suk Jin, you should keep paying
attention to the fire.

892
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,310
It's like raising a child.

893
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,020
You have to keep an eye on it
even when it's burning.

894
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,260
- You can leave it for a while.
- No. I just told you.

895
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,560
You have to keep watching it.

896
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,060
It's burning well by itself.
What's wrong with you?

897
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,120
- It's not like that.
- It's burning well.

898
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,390
It's so good.

899
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,090
(But he can't seem to leave the fire
like a helicopter parent.)

900
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,390
- It's burning so well.
- Is everything going well here?

901
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,300
It makes me happy.

902
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,240
- Listening to the crackling sound,
- Right. I like that sound.

903
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
- I can zone out while watching it.
- Exactly.

904
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,440
It's amazing.

905
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,170
Now, we should start making broth.

906
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,070
Where is it? Where is the fridge?

907
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,670
Oh, the fridge...

908
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,220
- The fridge is in there.
- Where?

909
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,990
- I see sardines and anchovy there.
- I found sardine.

910
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,880
- Give me sardine and anchovy.
- Sardine and anchovy.

911
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,060
Let's make broth with those.

912
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,290
- Hold on.
- We should pour some more water.

913
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,150
We should pour some more water.

914
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,890
- Oh, my. The water is boiling.
- My, look at that.

915
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,130
It's beautiful.

916
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,160
It's amazing.

917
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,710
(Suk Jin saw something
in the water.)

918
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,570
- Don't dump the water there.
- Where else should I dump it?

919
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,950
- Don't dump the water there.
- It hurts my eyes. Where else?

920
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,570
- The ground will freeze.
- No, it won't.

921
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,250
- Suk Jin, trust me.
- Suk Jin, the ground will freeze.

922
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,750
- You shouldn't dump it there.
- It'll freeze the ground. Stop it.

923
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,810
I can't believe him.

924
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,490
If you pour water there,
the ground will freeze. Stop it.

925
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,290
- It'll freeze?
- Of course.

926
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,850
Gosh. Then where...
Darn it. That's hot.

927
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,650
It's too hot. Darn.

928
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,150
Then should I dump it over there?

929
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,920
He's only been on variety shows
filmed in a studio.

930
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,270
There's nothing we can do.

931
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,970
It's too late to teach him.

932
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,890
(He has 31 years of experience,
but still has a lot to learn.)

933
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,160
- How many times should I do this?
- Suk Jin.

934
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,980
- When we were on "Family Outing,"
- You might scoop out all of it.

935
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,450
- we ate food with dirt in it.
- That's right.

936
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,900
- It's all natural.
- The water looks clear, indeed.

937
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,450
- It's all natural.
- Can we drink this as it is?

938
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,610
- He's scooping out all the water.
- It's not like that.

939
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,340
- You shouldn't do that.
- Look. There's dirt in the water.

940
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,880
- That's okay. It won't kill you.
- It's okay.

941
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,810
I'm telling you,
the cauldron is not clean enough.

942
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,350
I said it won't kill you.
Suk Jin, you...

943
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,850
Let's just eat out.

944
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,990
(He's tired of arguing.)

945
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,000
It's really hard to shoot
a show like "Family Outing."

946
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,060
- A show like "Family Outing?"
- When you watched it at home...

947
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,700
I often said,
"They get paid for having fun."

948
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,440
- Exactly.
- But there's a lot of work to do.

949
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
- That's enough.
- We shouldn't waste the fire.

950
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,310
- I'll put a cauldron on it.
- Right. It's burning well.

951
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,250
Hey, let's wash it first.

952
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,410
- What do you mean?
- The cauldron.

953
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,170
- We should wash it first.
- Okay.

954
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,140
Shall we fill it with water
and move it there?

955
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,150
Let's carry it together.

956
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,350
Fill it with water first.

957
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,850
Suk Jin,
from this angle, you look...

958
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,030
Oh, my. You look like...

959
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,120
(A strong flow)

960
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,470
From this angle, you look like...

961
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,700
(He looks like a tough guy.)

962
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,970
- My gosh.
- What do you mean?

963
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,940
- From this angle, you look like...
- I know.

964
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,270
- Suk Jin...
- Do I look incredible?

965
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,900
- The flow can't be that strong.
- Right.

966
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,070
Suk Jin, you look incredible.

967
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,170
(The middle-aged man shows off
his health using the hose water.)

968
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,310
- Isn't this enough? It's too much.
- Right. It's enough.

969
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,640
I'll add the ingredients
for the broth.

970
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,720
Where?

971
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,310
- In that cauldron.
- Oh, we have the ingredients.

972
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,050
(Ji Hyo's broth recipe)

973
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,910
(Add sardines and anchovies together
to make a rich flavor.)

974
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,150
- Okay.
- I rinsed it. It'll be okay, right?

975
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,650
- It's okay. We'll boil it anyway.
- Right?

976
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,820
- Put it in.
- Okay. I'll put it in.

977
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,860
Yes. It's okay.

978
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,420
- Good.
- Where's the lid?

979
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,690
My, it's burning so well.

980
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,460
Whose coffee is this?

981
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,460
It's mine, Suk Jin.

982
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,340
She put this...

983
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,710
Oh, no. Hey, Ji Hyo.

984
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,360
Did you put in
the whole bag of sardines?

985
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,400
Yes, I put all of it in. Why?

986
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,340
(Cheerful)

987
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,110
(Earlier on)

988
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:51,920
(She put in
the whole bag of sardines...)

989
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,920
(and all of the anchovies they had.)

990
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,230
(No wonder why
the pouches looked so big.)

991
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,190
We'll add ramyeon seasoning anyway.

992
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,400
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Don't worry.

993
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,590
- We'll add ramyeon seasoning later.
- Good job.

994
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,900
That's not the point.

995
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,570
- You did well.
- We'll add ramyeon seasoning later.

996
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,940
That's not the point.

997
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,040
- We'll eat them all anyway.
- Hey.

998
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,460
- It's okay as long as it's tasty.
- That was a big bag.

999
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,230
- We can even use plain water.
- Did you put the whole bag?

1000
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,810
- It doesn't matter.
- Hey, Ji Hyo.

1001
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,480
Two bags that are this big are
enough for six months.

1002
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,650
For six months.

1003
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,250
- We have to take one out.
- We can just eat it as it is.

1004
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,110
- Let's just eat it as it is.
- It's okay as long as it's tasty.

1005
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,290
- Will you open up a restaurant?
- I mean...

1006
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,650
- No. It's okay, right, Jae Suk?
- You know what I mean.

1007
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,650
Ji Hyo,
I see that you were not joking.

1008
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,380
- I wasn't joking.
- You really are bad at cooking.

1009
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,860
- I really am bad at cooking.
- You weren't joking.

1010
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,730
- I was so surprised.
- I mean...

1011
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,090
- We can still enjoy the food.
- You're right.

1012
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,130
- We can just add ramyeon seasoning.
- Ji Hyo.

1013
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,730
Did you put the sardines
and anchovies in separate bags?

1014
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,340
Or did you mix them
and put them in two bags?

1015
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,840
- I put them in separate bags.
- You brat.

1016
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,270
- Which one should we take out?
- You did well.

1017
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,020
I can't decide.

1018
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,980
- Why should we take one out?
- We should use...

1019
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,750
You need to mix them
if you want the broth to taste good.

1020
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,440
But we have to take out one of them.

1021
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,560
- Should we take the sardines out?
- No, don't take out any of them.

1022
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,630
Since we already put them in,
take the anchovies out.

1023
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,730
And put them in the other cauldron.

1024
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,420
Wait. Which bag has sardines in it?

1025
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,290
This one must be it.

1026
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,340
- Open the lid. I'll move it there.
- Listen to me.

1027
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,790
Okay.

1028
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,900
Why didn't we come up with this idea
when we were on "Family Outing?"

1029
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,840
(The members will enjoy
the rich taste of each.)

1030
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,230
- It's nice. Jong Kook.
- Oh, dear.

1031
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,980
- Yes?
- Wear these. Your eyes won't burn.

1032
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,900
- Those remind me of Turbo.
- My eyes are burning.

1033
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,770
- Try them on.
- It's warm.

1034
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,170
- Gosh. My eyes are burning.
- This is nice.

1035
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,690
- Oh, it really works.
- Your eyes won't hurt anymore.

1036
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,020
- Aren't you a member of Turbo?
- Exactly.

1037
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,290
(Turbo is back.)

1038
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,420
Aren't you a member of Turbo?

1039
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,520
- Turbo.
- My gosh.

1040
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,420
The water started boiling.

1041
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,730
I think it's boiling now.

1042
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,900
It's totally boiling.

1043
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,020
Good.

1044
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,860
- Shouldn't we take the lid off?
- Why...

1045
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,340
Why are you fanning
the inside of it, Ji Hyo?

1046
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,210
(She's fanning the cauldron
for a mysterious reason.)

1047
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,170
- Ji Hyo, why are you doing that?
- Why are you doing that?

1048
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,630
- Why are you fanning it?
- I want to see inside,

1049
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,670
but I can't see anything.

1050
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,110
- I can smell it.
- Oh, to see inside?

1051
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,270
- I see.
- I can smell the scent of anchovy.

1052
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,540
Of course, you can smell it.
She put in the whole bag.

1053
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,920
- It'd be weird if you can't.
- Ji Hyo, it has a strong scent.

1054
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,980
If we boil it for too long,

1055
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,320
- it might taste bitter.
- That's right.

1056
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,920
The fire is amazing.

1057
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,960
Look at the fire. I'm impressed.

1058
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,590
- But it smells good.
- We could cook a chicken here.

1059
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,770
- Shall we cook some sweet potatoes?
- No.

1060
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,670
Hey, prepare some sweet potatoes.

1061
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,000
- Shall we cook some?
- Yes, let's do that.

1062
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,130
Wrap some sweet potatoes in foil.

1063
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,340
- Look at these sweet potatoes.
- Suk Jin.

1064
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,270
- They look yummy.
- You should wrap them in foil.

1065
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,440
- Sorry?
- Aluminum foil.

1066
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,400
That's not necessary.
We can just dust it off.

1067
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,570
- That won't work.
- No.

1068
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,840
- You'll burn them.
- Darn it.

1069
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,750
- I said it wasn't the right way.
- You'll burn them.

1070
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,340
- Really?
- You should wrap them in foil.

1071
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,250
Don't they just eat it
while getting all sooty...

1072
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,790
- when you cook it in a fire?
- You're from Seoul.

1073
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,860
I'll cut it for you.

1074
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,110
Earlier,

1075
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,320
he complained
that the cauldron was dirty.

1076
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,400
But he's willing to eat it
while getting all sooty?

1077
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,820
Does foil have
a front and back side?

1078
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,230
I can just put them in there, right?

1079
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,770
Can I put them anywhere?

1080
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,840
- What are you putting in there?
- The sweet potatoes.

1081
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,040
Suk Jin put the sweet potatoes
over it like cooking pork belly.

1082
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,730
- What's wrong with him?
- He drives me crazy.

1083
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,380
Come on, Suk Jin.

1084
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,650
- Look. He put them on the top.
- You shouldn't do that.

1085
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,610
- You should've put them under it.
- They'll burn.

1086
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,520
You should've put them
in the corner like this.

1087
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,750
- But...
- Even I know that much.

1088
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,460
They've all scorched already.

1089
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,420
- But I wrapped them in foil.
- I'll show you.

1090
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,630
- You put it in the corner.
- Really?

1091
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,790
You place them at the bottom
by the flame like this.

1092
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,960
Roasted sweet potatoes will be
so delicious, right?

1093
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,670
(They must be feeling
a little hungry now.)

1094
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,090
By the way,
the broth might boil down.

1095
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,270
Shall I try calling them?
What's taking them so long?

1096
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,540
Suk Jin, call So Min right now.

1097
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,570
(They haven't heard
from the Grocery Team.)

1098
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,250
- Could they be eating something?
- My gosh. So Min, that brat.

1099
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,920
I'm sure they're having some snacks
at the market.

1100
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,210
That's possible.

1101
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,090
They're not even picking up.

1102
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,880
- That's a rice cake shop.
- It's a rice cake shop.

1103
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,060
- Oh, my. Hello.
- Hello.

1104
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,690
- That jeolpyeon looks so tasty.
- Hello.

1105
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,920
- Hello.
- This must be a famous shop.

1106
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,090
This is a famous shop, right?

1107
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,400
A lot of celebrities have come here.

1108
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,770
- We'd like to buy some rice cakes.
- We're about to pull it out.

1109
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,860
- Pull it out?
- Yes.

1110
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,540
You can watch
how we pull out garaetteok.

1111
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,810
- Will you show us?
- You can try it too.

1112
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,400
Are you the director?

1113
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,500
(Are you the director?)

1114
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,570
I see there's another camera here.

1115
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,380
Since celebrities are here,
I want to film you all.

1116
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,940
- Can we go in there?
- You speak like a director.

1117
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,540
My gosh.

1118
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,610
I'm excited.

1119
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,420
(They will watch
how rice cakes are made.)

1120
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,540
This is fascinating.
I've never seen this before.

1121
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,820
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1122
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,380
(Freshly made rice cakes)

1123
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,480
It's fascinating.

1124
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,820
It looks good.

1125
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,820
- That's baekseolgi.
- If you...

1126
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,090
- Is a small piece of it baekseolgi?
- No.

1127
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,590
- No?
- You make tteokguk...

1128
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,090
with thin slices of that.

1129
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,540
Oh, that's not baekseolgi.

1130
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,400
Ma'am, you look so busy.

1131
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,710
- She's filming us...
- Put it down for a while.

1132
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,980
while making rice cakes.

1133
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,210
I'm the busiest person in this shop.

1134
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,040
Even Chan Hee can't do that.

1135
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,710
- My, look at this. It's coming out.
- It's coming out.

1136
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,190
That's awesome. Look at that.

1137
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,090
I'm getting so excited.

1138
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,690
That's interesting.

1139
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,860
Are you two siblings?

1140
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,190
- Yes.
- She's my older sister.

1141
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,400
(The two of them are siblings.)

1142
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,920
How long have you been
working together?

1143
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,290
For about ten years.

1144
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,690
- It's been over ten years.
- I see.

1145
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,570
How long have you been
a camera operator?

1146
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,170
- Today is my first day.
- I see.

1147
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,840
She looks like a veteran.

1148
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,040
(Yangpyeon Kang Chan Hee is modest.)

1149
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,440
- The color changes.
- Can we try some?

1150
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,210
Yes, just a little.
Thank you so much.

1151
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,020
Two pieces would be enough.

1152
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,770
Oh, my. Woo Jae, pick a piece.

1153
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:22,940
- It's too hot.
- It's too hot.

1154
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,110
Gosh, it's too hot.

1155
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,560
Enjoy.

1156
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,650
(Awesome)

1157
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,900
Thank you.

1158
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,630
- Woo Jae, why aren't you eating?
- I'm touched.

1159
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,900
- Eat some more.
- It's amazingly good.

1160
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,630
- Finish it.
- Can you...

1161
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,040
Can you tell us why you're touched?

1162
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,000
What about the rice cake
makes you feel that way?

1163
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,270
- I'm curious.
- It's...

1164
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,340
I think this is his first time
trying rice cake.

1165
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,900
You know a pure taste, right?

1166
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,110
What have you been eating?

1167
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,810
- Do you know what pure taste is?
- Right.

1168
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,840
Jong Kook, stop adding firewood.

1169
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,590
It's because... You know...

1170
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,820
Are you trying to melt the cauldron?

1171
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,250
No.

1172
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,920
- It's just...
- That's enough.

1173
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,500
- You're wasting our firewood.
- That's why I asked...

1174
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,900
- We should save some for tomorrow.
- I asked earlier...

1175
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,130
if that would be enough.

1176
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,090
- The firewood...
- I'll have to go gather firewood.

1177
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,070
- We won't have enough firewood.
- Jae Suk.

1178
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,630
I think
I'll have to go gather firewood.

1179
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,130
- I'll go get some more firewood.
- I mean why...

1180
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,710
- I'll cut down a tree.
- Look what you've done.

1181
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,270
I might meet a fairy while doing so.

1182
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,610
- I might meet a fairy there.
- Stop putting it.

1183
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,270
- The fire is too strong.
- I mean...

1184
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,710
It's because Jong Kook finds it fun.

1185
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,420
Yes. It's nice to do it
after a long time.

1186
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,610
Why are you putting so much?

1187
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,690
Wait. We should boil noodles too.

1188
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,960
- The noodles are...
- We should boil noodles too.

1189
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,750
- But...
- We should put noodles in,

1190
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,560
but the water keeps evaporating.

1191
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,130
They're taking forever.
The water is evaporating.

1192
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,520
But we should boil noodles.

1193
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,630
- We can boil them here.
- Let's boil them separately.

1194
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,440
- Here?
- But we don't need to do that now.

1195
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,460
Why not?

1196
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,690
If we boil them now,
they'll get all soggy.

1197
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,070
- Yes. We don't have noodles anyway.
- We just wanted to boil water.

1198
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,070
We don't have noodles?

1199
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,710
- They went to buy them.
- What's this conversation?

1200
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,610
- Hey. They went to get them.
- I mean...

1201
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,610
- What are you doing?
- We...

1202
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,340
- Why?
- We don't have noodles.

1203
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,150
But you're talking
about boiling them.

1204
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,750
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

1205
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,520
- They went to buy them.
- We don't have noodles here?

1206
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,090
- The guys went to get them.
- That's what we were talking.

1207
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,110
We don't have noodles?

1208
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,560
I said we should put noodles in,
but the guys weren't coming.

1209
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,960
Why were you boiling the broth
if we didn't have noodles?

1210
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,320
- I mean...
- We were doing it in advance.

1211
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,690
We thought they would come soon.

1212
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:13,900
Why are you boiling the broth
when we don't have noodles?

1213
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,750
They should be back in five minutes.

1214
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,070
- I know.
- That's why.

1215
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,500
- But they're taking too long.
- Detective Kim.

1216
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,790
You should go get them.

1217
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,590
- Now...
- Go get them.

1218
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,440
You should go get those guys.

1219
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,900
Go get them. Grab their collars.

1220
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,340
I should go get them.

1221
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,400
- We should catch them.
- These punks.

1222
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,670
- Detective Kim.
- Yes.

1223
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,810
(A team to arrest Best Couple
is formed.)

1224
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,920
Let's go get them.

1225
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,920
- Let's go.
- You should go...

1226
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,110
- You should be back quickly.
- to intimidate them.

1227
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,060
- We should go get them.
- Wear black.

1228
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,790
- You should get them.
- I can wear the goggles, right?

1229
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,790
Yes.

1230
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,020
- Wait. Let's go.
- I'll wear them.

1231
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,590
- This won't do. Go get them.
- Let's go get them.

1232
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,360
- Give me a towel.
- I'm so upset.

1233
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,860
I'll go get them.

1234
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,630
- Ji Hyo, keep an eye on it.
- Yes.

1235
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,920
- I'm so mad.
- Detective Kim can intimidate them.

1236
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,190
Right.

1237
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,630
- Let's go.
- Grab their collars.

1238
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,040
- I'll go and grab their collars.
- Let's go.

1239
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
Let's go get them.

1240
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,440
With an axe?

1241
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,130
- Let's go.
- Go get them.

1242
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,480
- These punks...
- See you later.

1243
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,810
- Let's go, Jae Suk.
- See you.

1244
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,670
These guys are slacking.

1245
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,840
- We got a perfect car for a chase.
- This is nice.

1246
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,690
- Let's go, Jong Kook.
- Okay.

1247
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,650
- With a small car...
- Right? Something like a Pride.

1248
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,650
We should go quickly and grab
their nape to drag them back.

1249
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,630
Please go.
I'll grab the back of their neck.

1250
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,420
- We...
- I'm wearing cotton work gloves.

1251
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,000
- Good job.
- I didn't take them off.

1252
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:31,130
I'll pinch Haha's cheeks
and rub some charcoal.

1253
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,610
We should catch them
and put them in the backseat.

1254
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,980
In the back.

1255
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,040
(They're going to put them
in the back over there.)

1256
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,440
We should put them in the car
and come back.

1257
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,540
Hey. Let's buy clothes.
You need to buy clothes.

1258
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,070
No. I don't need it.

1259
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,920
- You should get one.
- They only have that kind of style.

1260
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,210
- No. You need to buy clothes.
- You should get clothes.

1261
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,250
There are many things here.

1262
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,630
- Now, the weather is cold...
- There's a photo studio too.

1263
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,420
and it's a weekday.
But this downtown...

1264
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,130
There's a sushi place too.
This place is so...

1265
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,290
- This must be the main street.
- This is the main street.

1266
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,040
I understand
why they would go crazy here.

1267
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,400
That's Burger King.

1268
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,070
Yes. This is definitely downtown.

1269
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,210
It's busier than Anyang.

1270
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,730
There is a camera.
Can you stop here?

1271
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,940
(He found a cameraman on the way!)

1272
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,880
- Hold on. These punks...
- These punks...

1273
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,320
- When they come out...
- Where are they?

1274
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,380
- Don't get off now.
- Don't get off now.

1275
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,980
We should catch them
when they're here.

1276
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,960
- When they're off guard.
- When they're off guard.

1277
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,150
We should get them
when they're off guard.

1278
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,650
When they're having fun
knowing nothing.

1279
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,860
- This won't do.
- These punks.

1280
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,500
(The time is now!)

1281
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,360
- Where are they?
- Are they kidding me?

1282
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,230
(Two detectives went out
to arrest them.)

1283
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,630
This looks warm.

1284
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:37,070
This looks really warm.

1285
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,670
(Black pants caught
Detective Kim's eyes.)

1286
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,710
Wait, no...

1287
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,210
(He's back
on the arresting mission.)

1288
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,310
These little...

1289
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,810
(He starts searching
a grocery store nearby first.)

1290
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,250
- I don't think they're here.
- They're not here.

1291
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,670
I think they went somewhere else.

1292
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,110
(They didn't even come
to a grocery store yet?)

1293
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,840
- They're not here.
- They're not here.

1294
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,650
Where are they?

1295
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,460
Where are they?

1296
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,560
(Staff members are here,
but no one is shopping there.)

1297
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,090
- Where did they go?
- Where did they go?

1298
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,150
(Staff members are here,
but no one is shopping there.)

1299
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,320
Where are they hanging out?

1300
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,690
Is Woo Seok doing well?

1301
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,690
He's doing well.

1302
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,540
I told him I was appearing on
Running Man yesterday.

1303
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,630
You did?

1304
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,340
- Who is he?
- Byeon Woo Seok. His friend.

1305
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,900
He came with Woo Jae last time.
The good-looking one.

1306
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,540
- The one with a small face?
- Yes. He's very handsome.

1307
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,810
Hey, this place is better.

1308
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,980
You're right. We can't help it.

1309
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,980
(You always find something better
after getting something.)

1310
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,340
This is why we should buy something
after looking around.

1311
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,190
- The size is much better.
- This one is funnier. Let's go.

1312
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,480
Where are they hanging out?

1313
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,420
Did they go to a karaoke?

1314
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,380
You said there are ingredients
for the sauce, right? Chili powder.

1315
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,460
- At home.
- Hey.

1316
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,860
- You little...
- Come here.

1317
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,770
- Come here.
- Where did you go?

1318
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,000
- Where...
- We've been shopping.

1319
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,460
We just put the grocery in the car.

1320
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,590
Look at the grocery we got.

1321
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,540
- We're so tired.
- Look at the things we got.

1322
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,730
- There are so many.
- What did you do?

1323
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:45,900
What have you been doing?

1324
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,230
- We got meat.
- Come here. What did you get?

1325
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,770
There's nothing. I swear.

1326
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,440
- The items are over there.
- We're innocent.

1327
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,500
You bought this.

1328
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,750
- We didn't. This is a shopping bag.
- It's a shopping bag.

1329
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,170
It's a shopping bag.

1330
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,340
Where did you go?

1331
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:57,790
This is so unfair.

1332
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:01,150
- We really went to a mill.
- Hey.

1333
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,860
- Jae Suk. Look at this.
- What...

1334
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,420
- Look at that.
- What is this?

1335
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,520
- Come here.
- Look at him. It's him.

1336
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,690
- I got nothing for real.
- Come here.

1337
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:09,860
Look at this.

1338
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,730
This is for Se Chan.

1339
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,130
- What's this rice cake?
- We bought the rice cake.

1340
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,230
- Jae Suk, we got fresh rice cake.
- We got the fresh one.

1341
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,540
- That's why it took long.
- What?

1342
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,170
- We got fresh rice cake and...
- We came to Yangpyeong and...

1343
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,340
- Hey.
- Kim Young Chul...

1344
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:25,380
We were boiling the broth
and waiting for you for an hour.

1345
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,040
- We were boiling the broth.
- It's all evaporated.

1346
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,670
The pot is going to melt.

1347
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:30,540
- We made a fire and...
- Hey.

1348
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,590
- What are you doing here?
- You're making us feel bad.

1349
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,650
Hurry up and get in the car.

1350
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,710
- We should get tofu.
- We should get tofu.

1351
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,090
- They kept asking us to eat.
- You didn't get tofu yet?

1352
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,460
- Handmade tofu.
- We should get handmade tofu.

1353
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,190
- It's a famous place.
- The handmade tofu... Yes.

1354
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,730
- If we get it, we're all good.
- We got twisted bread sticks.

1355
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,230
- We got 9.
- We got 9.

1356
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,190
- For real.
- We got chapsal donuts.

1357
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,460
- Why are you smiling?
- The one you like.

1358
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,230
Jae Suk.
The dumplings? They're no joke.

1359
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:50,130
- He likes it. What will you get?
- Steamed dumplings.

1360
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,170
- Did you eat them?
- There is...

1361
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,360
- No, we didn't.
- You ate, right?

1362
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,480
- They just gave it to us.
- They gave it to us.

1363
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,730
- It was on TV. The rice cake is...
- I'm telling you.

1364
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,440
It shines like...

1365
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,540
- If you make tteokguk with that...
- Let's go.

1366
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,540
Let's go.

1367
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,170
- Handmade tofu.
- Let's go, Detective Kim.

1368
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,880
Let's go to the handmade tofu place
for now.

1369
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,980
- It's no joke.
- But...

1370
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,090
- Handmade tofu.
- You guys...

1371
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,610
should get it together.

1372
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,320
- We were working so hard.
- We were working so hard.

1373
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,690
My gosh.

1374
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,090
(His heart is burning
as the broth is boiling.)

1375
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,790
The broth is yellow.

1376
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,730
I see yellow things floating.
It's hot.

1377
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:24,810
Water.

1378
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
How many times did I pour water?
It keeps boiling down.

1379
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,070
My goodness.

1380
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,540
Gosh. The water is...

1381
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,750
(He keeps pouring water
to the broth.)

1382
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,960
Is it okay for broth
to look like this?

1383
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,690
The broth is too dark now.

1384
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,860
Is it too dark?

1385
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,420
Is it too weird?

1386
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,440
(Seok Sam gives it a taste.)

1387
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,230
It's too fishy.

1388
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,770
Would it be okay if we season it
with salt? Isn't it fishy?

1389
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,400
It'd be perfect
when seasoned with salt.

1390
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
You think so?

1391
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,920
- Of course.
- You're generous about your food.

1392
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,650
Add soy sauce and salt.
It'd be good.

1393
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,710
This is how sardine broth tastes.

1394
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,380
It's anchovy.

1395
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,690
Is it anchovy?

1396
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,480
This one is sardine broth.

1397
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,590
It's fishy.
I still can taste the fishy taste.

1398
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,230
It's like I had some salted seafood.

1399
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,170
- It's like I had sand lance sauce.
- It's not that bad.

1400
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,290
- It's honestly not that bad.
- I'm not joking. I'm serious.

1401
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,960
Can we make it better?

1402
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,730
(As the broth was about
to become salted seafood,)

1403
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:37,840
(Seok Sam tries to call
the detectives.)

1404
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,710
These guys must be eating.

1405
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,840
- They're not picking up.
- Try calling others.

1406
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,420
I tried calling everyone,
but no one is picking up.

1407
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,560
Why are they not coming as well?

1408
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,750
(The reason why no one
is picking up his call is...)

1409
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,820
My gosh.

1410
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,150
(because they're doing this.)

1411
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,630
Woo Jae.

1412
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,130
Let's break this record. 916 points.

1413
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,730
- Try it.
- Put coins in.

1414
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,230
Put coins in.

1415
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,900
Keep putting them in.

1416
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,710
(The five of them are busy playing games
while the broth is boiling.)

1417
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,270
- That was nice.
- So Min, can you give me money?

1418
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,770
- So Min. Give it to us.
- I only got a ten dollar bill.

1419
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,270
The broth keeps boiling down.

1420
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:16,980
What? The broth keeps boiling down.

1421
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,880
- We should go.
- They can keep adding water.

1422
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,360
- We should get dumplings, no, tofu.
- You can pour water into the broth.

1423
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,690
- Let's stop and get tofu quickly.
- Put coins in.

1424
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,730
- We should break the record.
- Come on.

1425
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,020
I mean...

1426
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,860
Jae Suk, stop. Get it together.

1427
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,250
- We should break the record.
- We should do it.

1428
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,320
Can you just give me a dollar?

1429
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,900
We should drive a car.

1430
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,290
- I...
- Indonesia?

1431
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:35,670
Yes. Indonesia.

1432
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,210
- Should I go get tofu?
- I got Thailand.

1433
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,540
Should I go get tofu?

1434
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:40,480
- You? Okay.
- Should I?

1435
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,230
Go get it.

1436
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,070
I'll get tofu.

1437
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,150
Go.

1438
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,820
I'm coming.

1439
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,980
(The race begins.)

1440
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,190
There you go.

1441
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,590
(The two detectives forgot
about their duty a long time ago.)

1442
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,250
Okay.

1443
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:02,500
(Four mischievous guys
were driving for a long time.)

1444
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:06,570
They said they came to catch us.
I think they came to hang out.

1445
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,230
Hello.

1446
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,310
- I'll get two tofus.
- Sure.

1447
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,670
- Hello.
- It looks so warm.

1448
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,980
It was made just now.

1449
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,480
It must be delicious.

1450
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,540
(She got steamy handmade tofus.)

1451
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,070
It looks so good.

1452
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,590
(A bite of freshly-made tofu)

1453
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,460
This is really good.

1454
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,250
I think we're boiling it too much.

1455
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,360
Let's take out the sardines.

1456
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,690
- Yes. Let's do that.
- Don't you think we should do it?

1457
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:38,960
Aren't we boiling it too much?

1458
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,230
Take them out now.

1459
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,570
I think I should take them out.

1460
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:43,630
(They finally decided
to take the sardines out.)

1461
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,500
If we boil them too much...

1462
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,940
(As soon as he opens the lid,
the scent of the sea bursts.)

1463
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,650
It's no joke. Look. It's fishy.

1464
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,710
Gosh, it's fishy.

1465
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,480
I can't believe this is broth.

1466
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,520
(Messy)

1467
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,690
We got broth from the bones too.

1468
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,630
The anchovies disappeared.

1469
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,400
We got broth from the bones too.
Can you give it to me?

1470
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,960
What?

1471
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,290
- Are you going to season it?
- Yes.

1472
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:12,360
(Ji Hyo is trying to make
the fish bone broth better.)

1473
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,570
I'll try it. Watch.

1474
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,900
Do you know how to season it?

1475
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:17,810
Hey.

1476
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,440
Hurry up.

1477
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,940
I'm tired.

1478
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,610
- I'm so tired.
- Ji Hyo.

1479
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,900
Guys.

1480
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,110
- I'm really tired.
- Why would you be tired?

1481
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,480
- I mean it.
- Stop lying.

1482
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,320
I have to lie down there.

1483
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,020
I'm so tired.

1484
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,380
(Ji Hyo tastes the broth.)

1485
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,880
Suk Jin.
I don't think we can eat this.

1486
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,920
Why?

1487
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,020
It's bitter.

1488
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,960
Forget it.

1489
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,140
What is it?

1490
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,580
- What's so hard about making broth?
- Try it.

1491
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,250
Just eat ramyeon.

1492
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,290
- It's fishy.
- It smells good.

1493
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,410
(Suffering)

1494
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,060
Does it taste bad?

1495
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,330
- I don't think we can eat this.
- I don't think we can eat this.

1496
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,790
It's so fishy.

1497
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,200
(It's become an extract.)

1498
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:33,290
Jae Suk. We can't eat this.

1499
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,660
It smells good.

1500
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,330
- Ji Hyo seasoned it.
- Really?

1501
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:41,270
Where is everyone?

1502
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,210
- It tastes good.
- Is that so?

1503
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,870
Try this.

1504
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,620
- This one is tasty.
- It's seasoned?

1505
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,710
This one is seasoned.

1506
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,350
Is it okay?

1507
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,020
Is that so? That's a relief.

1508
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,230
It's delicious.

1509
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,020
(Others also give compliments.)

1510
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,620
- It's very delicious.
- It is very tasty.

1511
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,830
This is really nice.

1512
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,500
This is the broth.

1513
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,960
- You're going to season it?
- Yes.

1514
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,200
Yes. You should put a lot of that.

1515
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,930
(Ji Hyo seasoned the anchovy broth
before the members arrived.)

1516
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,000
That's right.

1517
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,210
(Ji Hyo seasoned the anchovy broth
before the members arrived.)

1518
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:11,680
- Let's use this.
- Ji Hyo.

1519
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,210
- Let's use this.
- Let's make it with this.

1520
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,480
You should put six months' worth of
ingredients to make broth.

1521
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,020
You should put six months' worth of
ingredients to make broth.

1522
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,310
How many did you put in?

1523
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:22,120
- To make broth,
- I put in a lot.

1524
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,850
you should put in six months' worth
of ingredients.

1525
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,390
(Only the anchovy broth
survived in the end.)

1526
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,520
Should I put the noodles
in this one, then?

1527
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,330
- Is it boiling?
- It's boiling.

1528
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,350
- Should I put it in then?
- But this...

1529
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:34,020
broth isn't good.

1530
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,000
We're not going to use the broth
anyway.

1531
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,100
- Aren't you going to use this?
- We're using that one only.

1532
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,600
Should I put it in?

1533
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,660
- Put it in. We can't use this.
- It's enough.

1534
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,930
- You should put everything in.
- Put everything in.

1535
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:44,770
When are we going to make lunch?

1536
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,480
- Just put it in.
- Dinner should be...

1537
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,100
We have to make noodles anyway.
Just put it in.

1538
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,870
Do you have chopsticks?

1539
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,020
Chopsticks. I put the noodles in.

1540
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,850
I put it in.

1541
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:57,620
(Jong Kook is increasing the fire.)

1542
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,160
(Flaring)

1543
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,850
It must be very hot.
The noodles are getting cooked quickly.

1544
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,700
(The fire is very strong.)

1545
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,310
(She tries the noodles.)

1546
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,830
Come, Haha. I think it's ready.

1547
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,540
- Should I take this? Okay.
- Yes.

1548
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,310
We'll put it in cold water.

1549
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:23,770
I'll get the noodles out.

1550
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,480
The noodles.

1551
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,580
(She takes out the noodles
cooked in the stove.)

1552
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:28,790
It's cooked.

1553
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,580
The noodles are amazing.
You're recording this, right?

1554
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,790
Could you put the sieve closer?

1555
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:39,660
Here.

1556
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,390
- We should do it quickly.
- It's full now.

1557
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:42,890
Let's make the toppings.
Pour out some here.

1558
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:45,370
How many portions is this?
Why did you cook all this?

1559
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:48,140
- Did you put it all in?
- Yes. I did it just in case.

1560
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,500
(Zoned-out Crazy Sisters
put in everything they see.)

1561
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,950
Could you turn on the tap, Woo Jae?

1562
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,000
Pardon?

1563
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,810
Is Woo Jae the servant
of this place?

1564
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:00,850
- Woo Jae.
- Yes?

1565
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,310
Divide this, Woo Jae.

1566
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,980
You shouldn't do it like that.
The noodles will get overcooked.

1567
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,750
Woo Jae. Onions and zucchini...

1568
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,580
- Woo Jae.
- Yes?

1569
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,580
(Everyone looks for Woo Jae.)

1570
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,060
- Woo Jae. Hand me the sieve.
- Yes?

1571
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,290
How many times did we tell you
to give us the sieve?

1572
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,230
He's Lee Chun Hee
in "Family Outing."

1573
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,600
He's Lee Chun Hee in "Family Outing."
Woo Jae.

1574
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,160
He's the servant.

1575
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:26,410
Don't use this path.
I placed the noodles here.

1576
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,850
Who cools down noodles like that?

1577
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:29,910
(The noodles are finally done.)

1578
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,850
Try this. It's really bitter.

1579
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:34,890
- It's bitter?
- It's bitter.

1580
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,710
Add some more water.
Let's dilute it.

1581
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,710
- Hold on.
- Should I put more water?

1582
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,710
Add more water.

1583
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,120
Pour more water.

1584
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,330
Add a lot of water.

1585
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:43,620
It would be nice
if we can use this broth too.

1586
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,020
Yes. It's a waste to throw it out.

1587
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,060
It tastes nice.

1588
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,890
Add water two more times.

1589
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:51,540
It tastes good now.

1590
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,600
It tastes good?
Then leave it for a while.

1591
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,370
This broth tastes good now.

1592
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:56,500
(The broth tastes good again.)

1593
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:00,750
- It's better.
- It tastes good.

1594
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,000
- Right? It's tasty.
- We could make noodles with this.

1595
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,120
It has revived.

1596
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,910
It's better with more water.

1597
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:08,350
The flavor is weaker
after the noodles were cooked in it.

1598
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:12,910
It's weird. The Yangpyeong market...

1599
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,120
had a janchi guksu restaurant.

1600
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,830
It would have been easy
to buy food from there.

1601
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:19,790
Goodness.

1602
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,370
- What time is it?
- It's 1:30 p.m.

1603
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:25,460
It's 1:30 p.m. I'm starving.

1604
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,560
Goodness.

1605
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,160
You must be hungry.

1606
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,680
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1607
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,600
Let's put ramyeon
in the janchi guksu.

1608
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,040
Ramyeon? In the janchi guksu?

1609
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,140
It tastes amazing.

1610
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:37,810
It tastes amazing.

1611
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,850
You haven't tried it, right?
It's really amazing.

1612
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:43,310
Really? But we're supposed to eat
janchi guksu. That's the mission.

1613
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,310
Why would you make ramyeon?

1614
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:46,810
It's new.
It's not just ordinary ramyeon.

1615
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:49,930
It's nice to eat with janchi guksu.

1616
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,660
- You'll make janchi guksu here.
- Yes.

1617
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,750
Then I'll make ramyeon janchi guksu
here.

1618
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,270
- Should I put the ramyeon?
- Hold on.

1619
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,390
It looks nice.

1620
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,600
It will taste good
if you put the ramyeon seasoning.

1621
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,210
(They make the ramyeon first.)

1622
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,210
(They add the magic powder
in the anchovy broth.)

1623
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,710
It's really delicious.

1624
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:11,540
This...

1625
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,210
smells really good.

1626
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,020
- Really?
- The anchovy broth and...

1627
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,710
(The master's noodles
with strong curls)

1628
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,060
- It's done.
- Put eggs.

1629
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,350
Give me some noodles.

1630
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:26,350
It's fusion food.

1631
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,020
It's really delicious.

1632
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,060
Don't cook it.

1633
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:31,500
I'm not cooking it. It's done.

1634
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,960
It's done?

1635
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:39,370
(How does this fusion dish
look like?)

1636
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,370
I'll use this ladle.

1637
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,140
Use it. Put the broth.

1638
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,910
We have to eat this now.

1639
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,980
(He adds warm broth
to the well-cooked noodles.)

1640
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,020
We have to eat this now.

1641
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,520
- It looks delicious.
- We have to eat this now.

1642
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:51,810
It's janchi ramyeon.

1643
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:55,620
(He gets excited
and tastes it first.)

1644
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,290
How does it taste?

1645
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
Is it good?

1646
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,000
(It's tasty?)

1647
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,290
(Seok Sam also tries
after hearing it's tasty.)

1648
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,660
- It's strangely delicious.
- Right?

1649
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,980
- It's like...
- It's like udon.

1650
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,180
It's like udon.

1651
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:16,310
Katsuoshibu.

1652
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,810
Yes. It tastes like udon.

1653
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,020
- Like...
- That's true.

1654
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,310
- It tastes like udon.
- It's delicious.

1655
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:22,710
(Ramyeon with janchi guksu
tastes like udon.)

1656
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,120
It's interesting.

1657
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,980
- Come here.
- Let's eat first.

1658
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,620
- It's going to get soggy.
- Come here, Woo Jae.

1659
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,230
- I really want to eat it.
- He doesn't have an appetite.

1660
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,730
But I'm working on something.

1661
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,160
- Woo Jae.
- He doesn't eat much.

1662
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,290
It's delicious.

1663
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:36,100
(The broth chef
also tries the janchi ramyeon.)

1664
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,500
(Exclaiming)

1665
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,960
What's this? My nose.

1666
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,100
(It takes away the cold.)

1667
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,480
- It's delicious.
- It's good, right?

1668
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,950
Doesn't it taste like udon broth?

1669
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,310
It's nice.

1670
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,680
I'd buy it if it's sold.

1671
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,210
If you add janchi guksu and ramyeon,

1672
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,210
it tastes special.

1673
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,580
The ramyeon seasoning
is really amazing.

1674
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,620
(Janchi guksu with ramyeon
is receiving lots of compliments.)

1675
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:06,890
- The broth is like medicine.
- It's really delicious.

1676
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:10,230
- Woo Jae. Come and try this.
- Yes?

1677
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:11,290
(The small eater is making eggs.)

1678
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:12,540
This will burn if I leave.

1679
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,770
- You're good at cooking.
- We have to cook this.

1680
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:16,370
I'm from Olive.

1681
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,680
- He used to cook.
- He's good at it.

1682
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,040
It looks like a pancake.

1683
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,140
He's from where? What's that?

1684
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,350
- Woo Jae is good.
- We can cut that now.

1685
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,520
You have to cook the zucchini.

1686
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,120
We should make janchi guksu now.

1687
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,890
(So Min prepared the vegetables.)

1688
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:32,980
Cook them.

1689
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,850
(Woo-derella is cooking
the vegetables.)

1690
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:39,060
You're doing good,
but why do you look so petty?

1691
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,120
Woo Jae.

1692
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,000
You look petty
while cooking the vegetables.

1693
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,460
Be bold.

1694
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,370
You look like a sardine.

1695
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,930
Sardine?

1696
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,770
He looks like a sardine.

1697
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,370
What's a sardine?

1698
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:57,910
A sardine?
Something bigger than an anchovy.

1699
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,520
It sounds nice. Sardine.

1700
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,020
It's nice. My name is Sardine Joo.

1701
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,520
Variety is about building character.

1702
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,160
Wear warm shoes.

1703
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,290
What is it?

1704
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,770
He should wear warm shoes.

1705
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:19,100
That's right.

1706
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,930
- It goes well with my clothes.
- Yes.

1707
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:24,060
- Hey, you should take those shoes.
- Seriously.

1708
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,770
Jae Suk, they look good on you.

1709
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:27,640
I like these shoes.

1710
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,080
- Haha could give you such shoes.
- Of course.

1711
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,310
I waited a long time
for those shoes.

59:59,469 --> 01:00:02,800
Hey, should we make spicy noodles?
We have too many noodles left.

1712
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,060
- You can use kimchi.
- But we will eat dinner soon.

1713
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,830
That's right.
But we will eat dinner soon.

1714
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,750
We will have to start making dinner
as soon as we put this down.

1715
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,850
Spicy noodles and pork belly...

1716
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,290
- will be delicious.
- Okay.

1717
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:48,960
Isn't it funny?

1718
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,770
Top the noodles
with zucchini and egg garnish.

1719
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,310
You are good.

1720
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:57,710
- Woo Jae is good at working.
- He is good.

1721
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:59,270
- Woo Jae is incredible.
- Yes.

1722
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,600
He can cook.

1723
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,580
- Put the egg garnish on the top.
- Egg.

1724
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,520
- Okay.
- Use this. It's pretty.

1725
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,620
Make it pretty.

1726
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,710
We worked haphazardly,
but the dish looks impressive.

1727
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,160
It looks like something
you get at a restaurant.

1728
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,850
It looks delicious.

1729
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:14,750
Come here.

1730
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,730
Shall we pick up the chopsticks
and dig in?

1731
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:19,430
- Ji Hyo worked on this broth.
- Is it good?

1732
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:20,560
(He is excited
about the improved broth.)

1733
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:24,600
Why didn't you eat much?

1734
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,600
- My goodness.
- Isn't it...

1735
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,830
- I am really full.
- Really?

1736
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:28,540
- Yes.
- Doesn't it taste a bit fishy?

1737
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,870
I don't think it's tasty.

1738
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,680
- Doesn't it taste a bit fishy?
- Yes.

1739
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:34,950
- It tastes a bit fishy.
- It tastes fishy.

1740
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,580
Let's make a good shot.

1741
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,770
- Jong Kook, it's very fishy.
- Eat it with kimchi.

1742
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,350
I feel like I am eating on a boat.

1743
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:48,480
That's a nice way to put it.

1744
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,890
(He can smell the sea
from the janchi guksu.)

1745
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,930
The noodles aren't soggy, right?
The noodles aren't soggy.

1746
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:53,930
The noodles aren't soggy, right?

1747
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:56,330
(He has to eat kimchi
after a bite of the noodles.)

1748
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,930
What's up with the taste?

1749
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,700
- Ramyeon was much tastier.
- I am so full.

1750
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,710
This is my first time having
sardine broth...

1751
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:04,640
that tastes so fishy.

1752
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,980
I didn't know sardine
could be so bitter.

1753
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,450
I see that this punk is very bitter.

1754
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:10,640
- This is funny.
- What?

1755
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,680
This is funny.

1756
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,770
Do you know
what's unique about this dish?

1757
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,020
You can't eat it without kimchi.

1758
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,710
It's good with kimchi, right?

1759
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:18,790
- It's good with kimchi.
- Kimchi is the main dish.

1760
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:21,560
To enjoy the noodles,
you can't eat one piece of kimchi.

1761
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,290
(A heap of kimchi)

1762
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,390
It's like accompanying the noodles
to the kimchi.

1763
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,660
- You numb your taste buds.
- Seven parts kimchi...

1764
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,770
and three parts noodles.

1765
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,140
Wouldn't it be better
to add noodles to the kimchi?

1766
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,410
What we had earlier
was much tastier.

1767
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:37,710
- Ramyeon?
- Yes.

1768
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,210
- That's right.
- What we had earlier was so good.

1769
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,040
- That's right. It was insane.
- I know.

1770
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,680
I hadn't had
that kind of soup anywhere.

1771
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,770
But this is...

1772
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:48,620
Still, it's tasty.

1773
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:52,680
It's nice to eat outside
for the first time in a long while.

1774
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,390
- Look at him.
- Why are you so obsessed with fire?

1775
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:57,390
- He has been that way for a while.
- It's like hellfire.

1776
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,350
Hey, stop it already.

1777
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:01,430
- Hey. This cauldron...
- Hey.

1778
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:03,520
- Why do you keep stoking a fire?
- Do you think this is a sauna?

1779
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,890
- Seriously.
- I need to save the fire.

1780
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:08,370
- Hey.
- This isn't a steel mill.

1781
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:09,710
He wants to temper iron.

1782
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,310
Stop it already.

1783
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:12,770
- Jong Kook.
- It's too hot.

1784
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:13,830
I love it.

1785
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,500
I can't see the soup
because of the steam.

1786
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:19,040
I haven't seen that side
of Jong Kook before.

1787
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,210
Look.

1788
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:21,480
He is obsessed with fire.

1789
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,980
He isn't satisfied
with simply keeping it going.

1790
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,710
- It's like a smelting furnace.
- It has to burn up.

1791
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,680
- It has to burn up.
- It's like a smelting furnace.

1792
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,460
Jong Kook, my eyes are stinging
because of the fire.

1793
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,100
Jong Kook, I want some fresh air.

1794
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:35,160
I am in the countryside,
but my throat hurts.

1795
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,960
Aren't cameras on that side
meaningless?

1796
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,770
Aren't cameras on that side
meaningless?

1797
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:43,540
They won't be able to film anything.

1798
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,370
- They can only film from this side.
- The steam blocks everything.

1799
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:48,980
- The heat is nice.
- Cameramen don't even know...

1800
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,120
if the focus is out.

1801
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,850
Let's take out this cauldron.

1802
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:54,480
- Is there a thick towel?
- Let's do it later...

1803
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,790
when the fire dies down.

1804
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,180
- I think I can do it.
- Let's do it later.

1805
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,620
It could lead to an accident.

1806
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,350
- Jong Kook, do it later.
- Shall I do that?

1807
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:03,560
- Come here.
- I stoked the fire too much, right?

1808
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,660
It's no wonder
the two of you received an award.

1809
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,000
- What a pair.
- In that case,

1810
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,230
- shall I sit down?
- Sit down.

1811
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,770
Look at how strong the fire is.
Look at it.

1812
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:12,460
It didn't look like that before.

1813
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:14,370
It's incredible.

1814
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,910
I am full.

1815
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:17,870
- It's nice.
- The fire heats up the air.

1816
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,640
My goodness.

1817
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,850
It's pretty cold when I lie down.

1818
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,180
You can go into the room and rest.

1819
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:27,020
Shall I do that?
Do we have the time?

1820
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,560
Is the room warm?

1821
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,480
(Is the room warm?)

1822
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,890
- Of course it is.
- Is the room warm?

1823
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:39,460
- Is it warm inside?
- Of course it is.

1824
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,390
Let's see.

1825
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,930
It's warm inside!

1826
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:46,430
(It's warm inside!)

1827
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,660
It's nice.

1828
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,910
(The warm floor
chases away the cold.)

1829
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:52,500
It's nice and warm.

1830
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,410
Gosh, the floor is warm.

1831
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:57,540
I bet Suk Jin will fall asleep.

1832
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,810
- Then let's keep filming.
- Should we let him sleep?

1833
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,710
(Grabbing)

1834
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:05,790
(He gets ready to go to bed.)

1835
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:07,290
It's nice.

1836
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,680
It's nice.

1837
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:11,660
Gosh, the floor is warm and nice.

1838
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:23,560
(He falls asleep in 10 seconds.)

1839
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,830
I am 100 percent sure
that Suk Jin will fall asleep.

1840
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,870
He did strenuous work.

1841
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:28,080
He won't wake up, will he?

1842
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:31,980
(Thus, Suk Jin went on
a journey to the dreamland.)

1843
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,680
Don't I look like...

1844
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,680
a camping expert?

1845
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,450
Do you want coke?

1846
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,710
This is it.

1847
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:41,290
- Where is your cup?
- Here.

1848
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,350
Did you drink some?

1849
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:45,660
Give it to me.

1850
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,430
- Do you want sikhye?
- It's here.

1851
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:48,730
(Rummaging)

1852
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:51,270
(The protector of the fire
has no intention to rest.)

1853
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:53,000
- I will rinse it.
- It's okay.

1854
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,500
You said thought about me

1855
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,730
Will you use it?

1856
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:56,830
(He approaches the target
as he hums.)

1857
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:58,600
- I will rinse it. Don't shake it.
- Gosh.

1858
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,040
- It's frozen.
- Is it frozen?

1859
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,680
Did it freeze
because we kept it outside?

1860
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,520
My goodness. Haha, it will spill.

1861
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,620
(He adds two pieces of firewood
to the burning fire.)

1862
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:11,310
(Laughing)

1863
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,250
After comforting you
who grew gaunt in a few days

1864
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,430
I love the lyrics.

1865
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:22,660
- I headed back home
- I headed back home

1866
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,330
Hey.

1867
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:26,200
Stop adding firewood.

1868
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,430
- Hey, stop adding firewood.
- Let's turn this into a sauna.

1869
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,680
Jae Suk, the height is nice now.

1870
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:34,210
My socks are wet.

1871
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,680
(Dirty)

1872
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,370
So Min, I think they stink.

1873
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:43,040
- No, it's the smell of sardines.
- Sardines.

1874
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:46,520
Look at the fire.

1875
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,430
- It's no joke.
- It's like the fiery pit.

1876
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,330
- Yes.
- Yes. The fire of the fiery pit.

1877
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,390
We can leave it as it is now.

1878
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:54,600
(Proud)

1879
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,120
We can leave it as it is now.

1880
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,060
It's a song for Chan Hee.

1881
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:00,890
Shouldn't we play
an older song then?

1882
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:02,500
- This song is totally old.
- Really?

1883
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,640
Let's listen to it.

1884
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,540
Shouldn't we play an LP record?

1885
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,100
That's right.

1886
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:10,910
Jong Kook, the fire is dying.

1887
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:14,080
(Startled)

1888
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,290
It's okay.

1889
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:18,980
- He loves old songs.
- I said that the fire was dying...

1890
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,250
and he got up so fast.

1891
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:27,660
("Because I Love You"
by Lee Jung Suk)

1892
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:31,640
(It's a masterpiece of a song
that was released in 1987.)

1893
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,560
Thank goodness
I haven't listened to it before.

1894
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,960
Why do you need to leave
when you love the person?

1895
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:36,960
You are leaving
because you love the person.

1896
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,680
Then that person...

1897
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,410
- won't love you anymore.
- I released a remake of the song.

1898
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,910
That's why you leave.

1899
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:44,770
(The sentimentality of the past)

1900
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:46,580
That's messed up!
Why would you leave...

1901
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:47,580
when you love the person?

1902
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,080
- What was that sudden outburst?
- Seriously.

1903
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:51,560
What was that?

1904
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,020
Are you mad?

1905
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:54,790
- Seriously.
- Are you mad?

1906
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,460
What was that sudden outburst?

1907
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,890
I became angry...

1908
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:00,560
- because of the lyrics.
- We were enjoying music in peace.

1909
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,790
- What was that sudden outburst?
- The atmosphere was nice.

1910
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,620
Isn't So Min hilarious?

1911
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,460
("Hype Boy" by NewJeans)

1912
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,370
Woo Jae,
you can dance to "Hype Boy."

1913
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:13,810
- Woo Jae, you can dance...
- This is bad.

1914
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,580
to "Hype Boy."

1915
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:18,910
(Looking around)

1916
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:20,410
- Jong Seo is good at that dance.
- Really?

1917
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:23,020
- Really?
- Jong Seo is really good at it.

1918
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:24,640
Jong Seo, where are you?

1919
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,560
- Jong Seo, come here.
- Watch Woo Jae's dance.

1920
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:30,520
It has been a while
since I did the dance.

1921
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:32,750
- Go ahead.
- Sardine's "Hype Boy."

1922
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,000
- Let's see it.
- Sardine.

1923
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:36,700
- Here I go.
- Let's go.

1924
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,160
One, two.

1925
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,000
(He can dance pretty well,
but his limbs sway too much.)

1926
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,040
- You are good.
- You dance too halfheartedly.

1927
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,140
You are good.

1928
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:50,880
(Charming)

1929
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:56,120
You are good.

1930
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,840
- All right.
- One, two, three, four.

1931
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:04,630
(Let's see.)

1932
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,550
Jong Kook had the exact same face
at the award ceremony.

1933
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:08,670
- Jong Seo, come here.
- Hey, a celebrity should do better.

1934
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:10,000
Do you want to see
our producer do it?

1935
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,500
- Watch.
- Jong Seo, come here.

1936
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,370
- Watch Jong Seo dance.
- Come here.

1937
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:14,840
- Watch Jong Seo dance.
- He is in charge of me.

1938
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,870
- He is no joke.
- Play it from the start.

1939
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,170
All right. Let's go.

1940
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:19,430
Watch Jong Seo dance.

1941
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,880
- Watch him.
- Just now...

1942
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:23,380
This is how well our producer dances.
Watch.

1943
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:25,140
- Watch.
- Check out how well he dances.

1944
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:29,220
(Haha is seeing it
for the first time.)

1945
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,920
- He is getting ready.
- Oh, yes.

1946
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,090
- Where should he stand? Here?
- Where?

1947
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:48,630
(Here comes
a non-celebrity's "Hype Boy" dance.)

1948
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,260
What's up with him?

1949
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:55,000
- Hey, watch.
- I can't believe it.

1950
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,430
Watch.

1951
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:58,930
- My goodness.
- Jong Seo is really good.

1952
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,030
(Fancy)

1953
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,470
How is he so good at the dance?

1954
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,210
- How did he memorize everything?
- How is he so good at the dance?

1955
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:04,770
Jong Seo is really good.

1956
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:06,140
How is he so good at it?

1957
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,180
How did he memorize everything?

1958
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:10,140
What's up with him?

1959
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,480
- What?
- Okay, let's go.

1960
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,980
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1961
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,250
One, two.

1962
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:18,350
(The highlight)

1963
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:20,320
How did he memorize everything?

1964
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,350
(The Sardine Hunter)

1965
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:22,430
What's up with him?

1966
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:23,600
Watch.

1967
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,760
What's going on?

1968
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,390
- Why?
- Watch.

1969
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,470
(Highly satisfied)

1970
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:30,640
Watch.

1971
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,000
You didn't dance as well.

1972
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,730
He can dance so well.

1973
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,310
(Shocked)

1974
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:40,050
How is he so good at it?

1975
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:41,070
He is good.

1976
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,720
He must be a dancer.

1977
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,680
- Look at his moves.
- He is really good.

1978
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,680
(The perfect finale)

1979
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:48,050
- Your dance was subpar.
- You are a celebrity, you brat.

1980
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,850
- You punk.
- Did you see that?

1981
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,310
- A producer can dance better.
- Just edit out my dance.

1982
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:54,020
- Did you see that?
- Don't dance so halfheartedly.

1983
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,650
- Did you see his moves?
- I didn't dance.

1984
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:58,500
Don't dance
if your skills are subpar.

1985
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,890
- Don't do the "Hype Boy" dance.
- A producer can dance better.

1986
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,730
A producer can dance better.

1987
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:05,430
- A producer can dance better.
- Let me say this about "Hype Boy."

1988
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:06,470
- That's right.
- All celebrities, don't dance it...

1989
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,530
- if you aren't as good as Jong Seo.
- Don't do it.

1990
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,680
- Don't do it.
- A producer can dance that well.

1991
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:12,380
Don't dance on Running Man
if you aren't as good as Jong Seo.

1992
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,880
Of course. Why would you dance
if you aren't as good as a producer?

1993
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,420
That was so funny.

1994
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:17,880
Woo Jae prepared us
for the highlight.

1995
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,680
Sardine,
Jong Seo shined thanks to you.

1996
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,590
- Yes.
- I don't feel exactly happy.

1997
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:23,920
Jong Seo can dance really well.

1998
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,260
I made a living out of this
last year.

1999
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,520
He can dance really well.

2000
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,430
He has a talent for it.

2001
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:29,650
Suk Jin came out.

2002
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:32,000
You guys were being boisterous.

2003
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:34,630
You guys were being boisterous,
so I came out.

2004
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:35,800
Did someone dance?

2005
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,500
We will show you.

2006
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:39,470
Suk Jin will show you.

2007
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:40,640
That's a good idea.

2008
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,430
- Suk Jin.
- Stop it.

2009
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:44,230
- Show us.
- You should dance.

2010
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:46,570
- I mean...
- So Min should dance instead.

2011
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,070
Suk Jin, you should dance.

2012
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,350
- Why would I dance?
- You can dance well.

2013
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:52,610
- Why would I dance?
- You have to dance to this song.

2014
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:53,640
Which song is it?

2015
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,020
It's an old song.

2016
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:56,350
"Swallowtail Butterfly."

2017
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:57,350
("Swallowtail Butterfly"
by Kim Heung Kook)

2018
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:58,460
"Swallowtail Butterfly."

2019
01:11:58,460 --> 01:11:59,720
Show us your dance.

2020
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,760
Let's show them.

2021
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,890
(The song was released
33 years before "Hype Boy.")

2022
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:05,190
Everyone should dance to a song
that suits his or her era.

2023
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:06,190
Come here.

2024
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,300
(He begins to dance.)

2025
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,340
Let's show them.

2026
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:12,670
- Let's show them.
- Okay.

2027
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:13,730
Let's show them.

2028
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:15,100
(Suk Jin takes the lead
and 7 butterflies begin to fly.)

2029
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:18,680
- This is our "Attention."
- Shove it to their faces.

2030
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:23,720
(The NewJeans of the 80s and 90s
can dance as a group.)

2031
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,470
You should dance.

2032
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:26,940
- Good.
- Fly well.

2033
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:28,020
Let's fly.

2034
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:30,110
This is the highlight.

2035
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:32,960
(The group dance)

2036
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:39,020
(Suk Jin complained,
but he became the most excited.)

2037
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,430
- That was good.
- That was good.

2038
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:45,100
- That was funny.
- It was a group dance.

2039
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,710
"It's a Crazy World"
by Shin Shin Ae.

2040
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:48,030
We should show another dance.

2041
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,400
- So Min can dance to it.
- This song...

2042
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,140
- This song rivals "Hype Boy."
- We can dance in sync.

2043
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:55,050
Gen MZers, watch carefully.

2044
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:56,070
How do I know the dance?

2045
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:57,250
- It's a masterpiece.
- Yes.

2046
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:58,550
It's a masterpiece.

2047
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:01,590
("It's a Crazy World"
by Shin Shin Ae)

2048
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,350
That's the vibe.

2049
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,520
(Look at So Min.)

2050
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:07,130
There she goes.

2051
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:09,430
(The crazy lady is ready to go.)

2052
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:11,320
- It's So Min's turn.
- It's So Min's turn.

2053
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:16,170
(There goes So Min.)

2054
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:17,970
Is that how the dance goes?

2055
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:21,470
- She is good.
- She is good.

2056
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:23,310
There you go. You got the vibe.

2057
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:25,230
That's "Hype Boy."

2058
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:26,770
Is she imitating Han Min Kwan?

2059
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:27,850
There you go.

2060
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,850
- Your eyes should look like that.
- Look at her facial expression.

2061
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:34,310
Look at her facial expression.

2062
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,460
(She channeled Shin Shin Ae.)

2063
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,560
So Min doesn't disappoint.

2064
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,150
So Min doesn't disappoint.

2065
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,820
- Good job.
- It was popular in the past.

2066
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,560
- So Min.
- Good job.

2067
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,800
- Good job.
- That was funny.

2068
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:52,340
We showed them.

2069
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,430
- We showed them.
- Yes.

2070
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,100
- It was "Hype Boy" of the past.
- That's right.

2071
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,180
That was funny.

2072
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:57,810
- My stomach hurts.
- Can we take a break now?

2073
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:59,570
No. We need to get back
to filming now.

2074
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,640
- Can we take a break now?
- Wasn't that a break?

2075
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,350
- No, it was work.
- That was a break.

2076
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,550
We need to prepare dinner now.

2077
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:09,760
- It's a busy day.
- Let's work fast.

2078
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,560
That's the "Family Outing" style.
You stay busy throughout the day.

2079
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,430
I don't want to eat dinner.

2080
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,020
- What's this?
- What's this?

2081
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,220
Kim, Song, Yoo, Ji?

2082
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,350
- What's this?
- What?

2083
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,320
- Kim, Song, Yoo, Ji?
- Why...

2084
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,020
Where is Haha?
Why is Shopping Team missing?

2085
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,030
What's this?

2086
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,360
Kim, Song, Yoo, Ji?

2087
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,770
- Kim Jong Kook, Song Ji Hyo,
- We worked so hard.

2088
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:26,930
Yoo Jae Suk, and Ji Suk Jin.

2089
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,810
We worked from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

2090
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,900
We worked too.

2091
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,730
- We did all of this.
- We worked too.

2092
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:35,510
Some members are on the roulette...

2093
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:38,570
because they were chosen
by the scriptwriters...

2094
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:41,280
for having the best understanding
of the composition.

2095
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,150
- Understanding of the composition.
- Yes.

2096
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,150
(The members who understood
the composition of the episode)

2097
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:48,280
To make janchi guksu in a cauldron,
Jong Kook built a stove...

2098
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,460
and stoked the fire persistently.

2099
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:55,430
Ji Hyo added enough sardines
to make 50 servings of the broth...

2100
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:58,230
- and created a funny situation.
- It was funny.

2101
01:14:58,230 --> 01:15:00,400
Jae Suk created a situation
that was different...

2102
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,530
from "Family Outing"
for screen time.

2103
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,470
Suk Jin is funny since he keeps
forgetting about the composition.

2104
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:09,770
- I am like that.
- That's right.

2105
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:11,310
- How about us?
- I guess we didn't do much.

2106
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:13,140
- We worked too.
- It wasn't like we played around.

2107
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:14,810
I just danced
to Shin Shin Ae's song.

2108
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,810
- It will go into the next one.
- It will go into the next one.

2109
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:19,680
You will have a mission...

2110
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,560
- for a break.
- Okay.

2111
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,500
Through a mission,

2112
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,320
- you can win a two-hour break.
- What's the mission?

2113
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,820
It will be a team competition,

2114
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:30,230
so discuss when
the break should take place.

2115
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:33,430
Those with the same opinion
will team up together.

2116
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:35,140
We can put it here.

2117
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,400
Around 11 p.m.

2118
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:38,230
Will we be able
to fall asleep early?

2119
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:40,400
If you want to get up late...

2120
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,470
- I prefer getting up late.
- We should get up late.

2121
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:44,050
It would be better to sleep
and wake up early.

2122
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:45,680
But we won't be able to sleep early.

2123
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:47,440
Why don't we take a break now?

2124
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,980
If we take a break now,
we will feel more tired later.

2125
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,180
I am sorry,
but why do you keep wearing my shoes?

2126
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,220
Aren't they warm?

2127
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,430
- Seriously.
- They were here.

2128
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,560
(Shameless)

2129
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,020
- They are mine.
- They were here.

2130
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,100
Haha cherishes those shoes.

2131
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,130
Yes, he does.

2132
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:02,600
Come here if you choose 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.

2133
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,000
- I choose 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.
- Same here.

2134
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,430
Let's choose to rest now.

2135
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,770
Okay. I want to rest now.

2136
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,510
You keep joining the young ones.

2137
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:10,640
I am a Gen MZer.

2138
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,880
- Don't be ridiculous.
- We are Gen MZers.

2139
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,750
(We are Gen MZers.)

2140
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,880
You joined them
when they went shopping too.

2141
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:19,020
He is dressed like a man
who sells briquettes.

2142
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,750
You look like a servant, okay?

2143
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,920
Let's move
to the neighboring front yard.

2144
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,260
- Shall we go?
- Okay. Our team is bound to win.

2145
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:27,630
Of course.

2146
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:28,760
- Are we playing basketball?
- Okay.

2147
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,850
- I will explain the game.
- Okay.

2148
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,670
The mission is
the Basketball of Hardship.

2149
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:37,340
A representative from each team
will shoot free throws.

2150
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,730
The team that scores more goals...

2151
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:40,140
- will win.
- How many seconds do we get?

2152
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:43,970
The opposing team can throw snow
to disturb the player.

2153
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:47,750
The winning team will decide
when the break will take place.

2154
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,180
Let's go. Okay.

2155
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:53,350
Once you choose the first player,
put on the goggles.

2156
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:54,420
The goggles.

2157
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:56,560
- I won't score a single goal.
- She is bad at it.

2158
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,980
Seriously.

2159
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,090
So Min is bad at it.

2160
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,090
- I heard that.
- We just need to do well.

2161
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,260
- So Min?
- I heard that.

2162
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,300
- So Min?
- You said I am bad at it.

2163
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,390
Yes. You are bad at it.

2164
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:07,060
Who said it? You did, right?

2165
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,470
We said it's your turn.

2166
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,390
Can I see better
if I put on these goggles?

2167
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,060
They will keep the snow
from entering your eyes.

2168
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,070
Should I throw with bare hands?

2169
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,070
No, wear gloves.

2170
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:18,600
I won't get the hang of it
if I wear gloves.

2171
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,900
You won't get the hang of it anyway.

2172
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:20,940
That's not true.

2173
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:22,140
That's not true.

2174
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,220
(The crazy lady goes first.)

2175
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:24,470
Are you ready?

2176
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:25,550
It's so far.

2177
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:27,110
It's so far. This is bad.

2178
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:28,550
Get ready.

2179
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:29,720
Get ready.

2180
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:32,780
- Get ready.
- Jong Kook.

2181
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:33,960
(They prepare big shovels.)

2182
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,190
This is bad.

2183
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:37,260
(She begins.)

2184
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,720
Good.

2185
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,300
(They scatter snow for fun,
not to disturb.)

2186
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,340
One goal.

2187
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,840
Come on. One goal.

2188
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:52,180
(No one expected So Min
to score a goal!)

2189
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:57,570
- Two goals.
- Two goals.

2190
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:58,570
(She even scored the second goal!)

2191
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:00,810
(They can't believe the skills
of the forever referee.)

2192
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:01,850
You are doing well, So Min.

2193
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,220
- Keep going.
- So Min.

2194
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:05,720
You are cool.

2195
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:08,180
You are cool.

2196
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,800
(Both sides are having fun.)

2197
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,150
Keep going. You are cool.

2198
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:15,560
(Even if it ends now, it would be
So Min's best performance.)

2199
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,030
Keep going. You are cool.

2200
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:20,030
- She...
- Three goals.

2201
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,230
(She scores another goal.)

2202
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,680
She doesn't care about the snow.

2203
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:26,140
- Three goals. You are cool.
- You are doing well.

2204
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:27,970
She doesn't care about the snow.

2205
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,550
(She keeps her eyes wide open.)

2206
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:31,140
- Four goals.
- Four goals.

2207
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:35,720
This is too much.
She is covered in snow.

2208
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,810
- Five goals.
- Five goals.

2209
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,390
Hurry up.

2210
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:40,320
I am out of balls.

2211
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,060
Hurry up.

2212
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:43,460
I don't see the balls.

2213
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,560
(The round ends
as she digs for balls.)

2214
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,000
I don't see the balls.

2215
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:51,670
- I don't see the balls.
- So Min is so funny.

2216
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:52,900
I don't see the balls.

2217
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,730
Haha, the balls got buried.

2218
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,900
- That was funny.
- That was funny.

2219
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,070
This is bad.
The next player will suffer.

2220
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,680
The next player will suffer.

2221
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,680
- You were cool. You persevered.
- I focused on the task.

2222
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,270
- That was funny.
- So Min, are you okay?

2223
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,390
Yes, I am okay.

2224
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,780
Who will go next?

2225
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:09,140
Jae Suk should go next.

2226
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:10,960
Okay.

2227
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,390
(The mischievous man
who brought shovels will go next.)

2228
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:14,060
Woo Jae gritted his teeth.

2229
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:15,980
So Min.

2230
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:18,020
- So Min is annoyed.
- Okay. Bring it on.

2231
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:19,890
Bring it on.

2232
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,630
Gosh. Hey.

2233
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:23,730
All right. Bring it on.

2234
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:25,430
Let's do this.

2235
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,060
Ready.

2236
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:29,570
(Start)

2237
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:33,180
(Hitting the bull's-eye)

2238
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:35,210
Sorry.

2239
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:37,770
(While they make a big fuss,)

2240
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:38,810
Don't do this.

2241
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,250
(the attack isn't so impactful.)

2242
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,480
(She's putting snow in the bucket.)

2243
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,560
One.

2244
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,850
(He scores a goal.)

2245
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:54,470
(Despite their lame attacks...)

2246
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,770
- Hey.
- You should look at the rim.

2247
01:19:56,770 --> 01:19:58,300
He's not scoring.

2248
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:02,310
Gosh, this is...

2249
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:03,510
(The snow is getting
through his open teeth.)

2250
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:06,470
Jae Suk, you should score
at least one more goal.

2251
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:10,880
(He finally explodes
with his cold teeth.)

2252
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,960
(Strangely, his shots are accurate
when he aims at the heads.)

2253
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,060
(He shoots the ball into the hoop again
with 5 seconds left.)

2254
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,180
Gosh, I'm cold.

2255
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:23,960
How many goals did you score?

2256
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,760
- He scored two goals.
- What?

2257
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,860
- Two?
- Two goals.

2258
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:29,220
- Gosh, you...
- I'm so cold.

2259
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,730
Your feet are safe.

2260
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:31,860
What?

2261
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,100
The shoes are nice.

2262
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,670
(Thanks to the luxurious boots,
his feet are warm.)

2263
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:36,570
- The shoes...
- My feet don't get wet.

2264
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,400
- They don't get wet.
- I want to borrow them.

2265
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,250
This is... They are really nice.

2266
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,970
I'm sorry,
but can I borrow the shoes?

2267
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:44,680
- What?
- Can I borrow them?

2268
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,810
- He wants to borrow them.
- Can I?

2269
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:50,650
Do all of us have to try this
at least once?

2270
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,820
Isn't it two people per team?
Should all of us try it?

2271
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:54,820
(Woo Jae's team has 3 members,
so he has no choice but to try it.)

2272
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,760
- All right. Let's go.
- Who's next?

2273
01:20:58,350 --> 01:20:59,930
The basketball genius, Haha.

2274
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,020
Should I go next?

2275
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,820
(The little giant of basketball,
Haha)

2276
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,640
My goodness.

2277
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:05,970
- Gosh.
- Put it in.

2278
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:07,560
- Oh, dear.
- We should do this.

2279
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,880
Haha, you should start
before they fill the bucket.

2280
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:11,470
It'll be the same anyway.

2281
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,570
- Look how spiteful Jae Suk is.
- Look at him.

2282
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:15,640
He looks so spiteful.

2283
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,220
- He's spiteful.
- Why don't we start?

2284
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,590
Why don't we start?

2285
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:22,850
- Are you ready?
- Not yet.

2286
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:24,020
(He got carried away with the snow.)

2287
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,590
I really don't want to do this.
What should I do?

2288
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:32,020
Hey. Go ahead and start it.

2289
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,930
(There's another madman
who waits for his prey.)

2290
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:36,600
I'm going crazy here.
Hurry and start it.

2291
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,310
(The fireman joins them
with a fire extinguisher.)

2292
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:41,640
- Hurry.
- Let's start.

2293
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,270
- We're waiting.
- Can we really do this?

2294
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:45,570
They are blocking my view.

2295
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:46,940
Let's begin.

2296
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:48,880
- They are blocking my view.
- Let's begin.

2297
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:50,270
Ready.

2298
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,220
(Start)

2299
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,280
(He manages to weave
from the start.)

2300
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,060
Haha is good.

2301
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:00,560
(He starts a unique strategy
where he gets rid of the balls.)

2302
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:04,130
- Nice. One goal.
- One goal.

2303
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:05,630
There's no ball.

2304
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,140
(The second half begins.)

2305
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:13,510
Give me the balls.

2306
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:15,230
(Filling the basket
with snow instead of balls)

2307
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:17,730
Give me the balls.

2308
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:20,210
Darn it.

2309
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:21,680
(They interrupt him
with their perfect team play.)

2310
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,940
Here.

2311
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,020
(She attacks him from up close.)

2312
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:28,250
They can't do this in front of me.

2313
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,390
(His great shot doesn't go in.)

2314
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:33,780
(He's becoming a snowman
without displaying his ability.)

2315
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,780
In front of him.

2316
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:35,780
(He's becoming a snowman
without displaying his ability.)

2317
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:36,960
Nice.

2318
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,130
- In front of him.
- Is it done?

2319
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:41,820
(Time's up.)

2320
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,470
- Haha...
- He scored three goals.

2321
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:45,230
You scored three goals.

2322
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:47,060
- Three is good.
- He did well.

2323
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,930
- Okay.
- Let's just say we lost.

2324
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,030
- Just like this?
- Yes.

2325
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:53,070
- Should we rest now?
- Shall we?

2326
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:55,140
You can rest whenever you want.

2327
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:56,810
I think that's a good idea.

2328
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:00,280
My socks are all wet.

2329
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:02,550
Hey, you should wear good shoes.

2330
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,980
You can't do this in slippers.

2331
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,260
Who's next?

2332
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,930
Should I go next?

2333
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:09,220
- Yes, you go.
- Jong Kook?

2334
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:12,260
Wait. I should gather some snow.

2335
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:15,360
- If Jong Kook gets upset...
- He's scary when he's upset.

2336
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,360
(The next player to go
is feeling nervous.)

2337
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,930
- Ready.
- Jong Kook, score five goals.

2338
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:20,060
Go.

2339
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:22,170
You brat.

2340
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:24,310
What was that?
We can't let this happen.

2341
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:26,230
- Look at him.
- We should attack him right away.

2342
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:29,180
Woo Jae. We shouldn't be doing this.

2343
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:31,920
- Two goals.
- Hang on.

2344
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:34,480
You can't do that with the shovel.

2345
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,390
(Jong Kook, are you watching me?)

2346
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,180
- Good.
- Well done.

2347
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:41,650
Good.

2348
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:44,190
- Look at So Min.
- Why are you doing that?

2349
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:46,220
Look at Jeon So Min.

2350
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:48,270
- What are you doing?
- Jeon So Min.

2351
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,560
Good.

2352
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:52,030
Jong Kook, over here.

2353
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:54,030
Good. That was nice.

2354
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,510
- Hey. Nice.
- Jong Kook is good.

2355
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,140
He's like Jordan.

2356
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,380
- He scored nine goals.
- Yes!

2357
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:01,880
- It's over.
- Okay.

2358
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:03,770
Hang on. Gosh.

2359
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:06,750
- Just go. Don't budge.
- Kneel down.

2360
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,750
- No, open your eyes.
- Open your eyes.

2361
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:09,960
That was too short.

2362
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:12,420
They are hitting his face.

2363
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:14,960
Woo Jae, go ahead and do it.

2364
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,020
- Woo Jae, do it.
- Woo Jae, stand up.

2365
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:18,560
Where's the rim?

2366
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,760
Over there. Watch carefully.

2367
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,130
- Take a look.
- You should see it.

2368
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:22,430
Do something.

2369
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,060
Okay.

2370
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,170
- You should play it again.
- You do it again.

2371
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:26,670
- We will give you one more chance.
- Do it again.

2372
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:28,060
Someone else should do it.

2373
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,560
- Woo Jae, we'll give you a chance.
- Why?

2374
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,400
- Someone else should do it.
- Why would you give us a chance?

2375
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:35,770
(Let me see...)

2376
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:36,850
Woo Jae.

2377
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,680
Suk Jin doesn't have to play...

2378
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,420
- I know.
- because you already won.

2379
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,480
- Gosh.
- But he has to do it.

2380
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,680
No, it's okay.

2381
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,560
No. I finally got the hang of it.

2382
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:50,930
- No. The winner is decided already.
- We never know.

2383
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:52,500
We should do this until the end.

2384
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,060
We have to do this.

2385
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,770
- Seok Sam, you go.
- We should try our best.

2386
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:59,360
- What are you talking about?
- Why are you being like this?

2387
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,730
We should try our best
until the end.

2388
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:01,930
Where are the goggles?

2389
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,470
Go easy on me.
It's already settled. Okay?

2390
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,680
It doesn't seem like match-fixing,
right?

2391
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,470
It doesn't seem like
we're losing on purpose, right?

2392
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:11,180
Hey, your face...

2393
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:12,640
What do we do with your face?

2394
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,920
Hey, now you use your face
to be funny?

2395
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,460
- Your face...
- Did you put makeup on?

2396
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:20,350
- You can't do this with your face.
- Now he even uses his face.

2397
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:22,720
- Gosh, he's so weak.
- I want to use my face to be funny.

2398
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,460
(Seok Sam steps up confidently.)

2399
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:26,820
I can just do this.

2400
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,320
Good.

2401
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:31,970
It's hard to get the distance right.

2402
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:33,400
Ha Ryong.

2403
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:35,100
- This is hard. Hey.
- Ha Ryong.

2404
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,840
You don't have to interrupt me.
It's not going in anyway.

2405
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,230
What are you doing?

2406
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:41,270
- Are you playing house?
- This is so fun.

2407
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:42,770
I'll do it like this.

2408
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:45,470
- It will be cute.
- Are you ready?

2409
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:46,980
Start.

2410
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,590
(Start)

2411
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:53,630
(Sprinkling)

2412
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:57,650
(He came up with a crafty trick that
doesn't require a lot of energy.)

2413
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:01,360
Hey. There's Mr. Um Hong Gil.

2414
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,100
- Keep doing it.
- That's good.

2415
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:08,270
- This is nice.
- Mr. Um Hong Gil.

2416
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,570
This is like the movie,
"The Himalayas."

2417
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:13,310
It's the movie, "The Himalayas."

2418
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:14,350
(He climbed the Himalayan peak
in 5 seconds.)

2419
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,510
This is hilarious.

2420
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:18,610
This is the movie, "The Himalayas."
He's Mr. Um Hong Gil.

2421
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,750
Jae Suk,
only his nose is covered with snow.

2422
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,060
Only his nose. How is that possible?

2423
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,680
(Only his nose is
covered with snow.)

2424
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,630
The snow piled up only on his nose.

2425
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:32,350
- Only on his nose.
- The snow is only on his nose.

2426
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:36,840
(The variety show deity is
blessing Seok Sam.)

2427
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,400
This is so funny.

2428
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,670
(Time's up.)

2429
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,270
Hey. Gosh, this is more shocking.

2430
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:47,270
(Even he finds himself shocking.)

2431
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:49,570
- Petty.
- That was hilarious.

2432
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:51,140
- It's funny.
- Didn't I score one?

2433
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:52,970
You scored nothing.

2434
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:54,420
- Nothing?
- I won.

2435
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,610
- I won, right? I scored one.
- I think I scored one.

2436
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,680
How did the snow pile up
only on his nose?

2437
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,920
That was so funny.

2438
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:01,260
The Nose Himalaya.

2439
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,930
(The miracle of the Nose Himalaya)

2440
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:05,100
A dunk shot

2441
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,560
So Team Sleep Early wins.

2442
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:08,560
Okay.

2443
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,360
You can put "Rest"
on the place you want.

2444
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,770
Okay.

2445
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,170
The fire probably went out.
Let's go.

2446
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:15,930
Right. The fire.

2447
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,810
The fire probably went out.
We should hurry.

2448
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:18,930
I'm hungry again.

2449
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:20,770
(The cauldron recipe is
getting more daring.)

2450
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:22,880
(Adding delicious things
in delicious things)

2451
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:25,380
(Are they finishing the long day
with a successful meal?)

2452
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,090
When Se Chan arrives here,

2453
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:28,750
if everyone's asleep,
it will be really funny.

2454
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:29,850
Is anyone there?

2455
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:31,780
(The man with a mustache
arrives late.)

2456
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,560
- Se Chan is here.
- I'm disappointed.

2457
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,350
(But the day is over for them.)

2458
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:36,650
(Se Chan should cook breakfast.)

2459
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,720
And I should pick two people.

2460
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,170
(He recommends the fire boy.)

2461
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,860
(He raises doubts
about So Min's stare.)

2462
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:44,970
- She's good.
- She was so sad.

2463
01:27:44,970 --> 01:27:46,100
If you look tired,

2464
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,640
I will have to pick that person.

2465
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:51,140
(The night is long.)

2466
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:54,970
(The single room league is
more fierce than ever.)

2467
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,250
(They talk about
the old days all night.)

2468
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,140
(And...)

2469
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:02,090
(Who will spend the second day
with Se Chan?)

2470
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:04,060
