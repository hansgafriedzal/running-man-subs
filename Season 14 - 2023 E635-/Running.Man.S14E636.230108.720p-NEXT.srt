1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,290
It's been a long time. I like the smell of firewood.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,690
This is a sunny place.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,260
It's called Running Man Outing Race.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,700
Cameras will film you for 24 hours...

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,130
- while you have fun at this house. - For 24 hours?

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,500
On the wheel, your names...

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,700
will take up a space following a specific rule.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,670
The wheel will be spun tomorrow.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,310
The chosen three people will win the gold.

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,510
For lunch, you will make a simple bowl of janchi guksu.

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,310
It's easy to make. All we need is anchovy broth.

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,610
Did you put in the whole bag of sardines?

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,520
Two bags that are this big are enough for six months.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,080
- I feel like I am eating on a boat. - With a lot of kimchi.

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,090
- You're good. - Good.

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,090
Only his nose is covered with snow.

17
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,120
- Only on his nose. - The snow is only on his nose.

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,660
Only his nose. How is that possible?

19
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,830
Hey. Gosh, this is more shocking.

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,950
Jong Kook.

21
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,130
- The fire went out.
- Hey, the fire is out.

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,020
- Gosh.
- Look at this.

23
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,190
It's really out.

24
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,070
This can't be happening.

25
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,730
- Hey.
- Jong Kook, hurry and come on.

26
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,660
- I can bring it back to life.
- They need to dry their clothes.

27
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,640
It's fun bringing it back to life.

28
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,140
(Laughing)

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,330
Jong Kook,
of all the episodes we've had,

30
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,600
you seem most excited today.

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,670
(Jong Kook seems
the most excited today.)

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,010
This is really fun.

33
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,050
The fire is perking up again.
This is amazing.

34
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,550
(Kim, the steel mill owner
likes to mend the fire.)

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,420
- Jong Kook likes this.
- They have good firewood here.

36
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,060
(He's going to use up
all the firewood there.)

37
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,630
Jong Kook really likes fire.

38
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,200
(The fire rises again
with Jong Kook's touch.)

39
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,820
I bet Jong Kook won't be able
to fall asleep tonight.

40
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,420
(His love for the fire
will continue today.)

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,840
- Because of the fire?
- Yes. To keep the fire burning.

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,390
It's going again.

43
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,740
- It's flaring again.
- He added more firewood.

44
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,430
(Flaring)

45
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,670
Actually, we are burning gas.

46
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,280
- Really? Are you serious?
- Yes.

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,140
There's a pipe under the fire.

48
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,450
It never goes out.

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,880
Hey, you know what?

50
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,520
- You look horrible now, seriously.
- Who?

51
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,960
- You.
- What's wrong with me?

52
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,330
It's funny you ask that.

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,920
You just look horrible.
I'm so surprised.

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,300
- I can't believe this.
- This is great.

55
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,660
Haha suddenly came to me and said,

56
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,360
"Hey, you know what?"

57
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,600
"You look horrible now, seriously."

58
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,000
(She tells them
exactly what she heard.)

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,530
- Haha did.
- Why did you tell them?

60
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,500
- Haha. Why?
- Yes.

61
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,800
- What?
- Why?

62
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,130
Why?

63
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,000
Suk Jin, look at her.
She looks horrible.

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,410
Gosh, this is serious.

65
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,580
This is serious.

66
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,110
This is so funny.

67
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,820
It's worst than you think.

68
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,110
Right.

69
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,380
(Not just a little.)

70
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,110
(You seriously look horrible.)

71
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,550
(Dumbfounded)

72
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,390
It's like this much.

73
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,420
This is how horrible you look now.

74
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,770
It's this much.

75
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,660
It's getting serious.

76
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,860
Right.

77
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,000
(Laughing)

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,610
They are like old ladies.

79
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,050
How you described it
was really funny.

80
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,440
The sound of your laughter
is more annoying.

81
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,770
(The two childish guys have fun
making fun of her.)

82
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,880
That's hilarious.

83
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,540
- My clothes are drying.
- I know. It actually works.

84
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,120
Of course.

85
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,190
Gosh, it's hot.

86
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,950
My boots are burnt.

87
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,820
As far as I know,

88
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,500
Haha treasures the boots.

89
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,220
He loves them.

90
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,100
He had to wait for a year
to get the shoes.

91
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,530
But he's not wearing them.

92
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,130
Gosh, you're really obsessive.

93
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,530
What do we do now?
Should we cook again?

94
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,810
We should start cooking soon.

95
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,850
Hang on. Again?

96
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,040
- We need to cook again.
- Gosh.

97
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,280
We should dry our clothes first.

98
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,850
What do we eat for dinner?

99
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,650
- Pork belly.
- And budaejjigae?

100
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,150
That sounds great.

101
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,850
We can cook pork belly here, right?

102
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,010
This one is better though.

103
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,060
We can put it on here.

104
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,950
Are you going to use
a caldron lid or a hot plate?

105
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,950
- Let's use a caldron lid.
- Okay.

106
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,950
- Then we should use this one.
- That one?

107
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,500
That's a perfect size, right?

108
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,290
- This looks really good.
- We should use this one.

109
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,530
Gosh, it's hot.

110
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,930
If you put it on here...

111
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,810
(She tries the sweet potato
they cooked in the morning.)

112
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,500
- How is the sweet potato?
- It's delicious.

113
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
It's good, right?

114
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,700
What if you get too full
to eat pork belly later?

115
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,100
You didn't eat janchi guksu earlier.

116
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,470
- I ate some.
- No, you didn't. I saw you.

117
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,280
- She didn't eat?
- Did you eat at the market?

118
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,380
Hey. You...

119
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,220
- So Min.
- Earlier...

120
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,750
- You didn't eat?
- You ate a lot at the mill.

121
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,950
- So Min.
- You ate rice cake.

122
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,400
- Is that true?
- Did she eat rice cake at the mill?

123
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,950
- A little.
- Did you eat rice cake at the mill?

124
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,820
The owner of the mill
told me to taste it,

125
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,320
- so I ate it this much.
- Only this much?

126
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,790
- Yes.
- It wasn't that much.

127
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,700
- How much was it?
- You...

128
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,340
You ate doughnuts.

129
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,070
And you ate two dumplings.

130
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,700
Did they eat?

131
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,310
(They end up revealing
the food they ate.)

132
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,970
- What else did you eat?
- You ate a croquette.

133
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,880
The vegetable croquette.

134
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,510
(They end up revealing
the food they ate.)

135
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,620
(Rustling)

136
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,060
Woo Jae, what are you doing?

137
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,750
- Woo Jae.
- What is he doing?

138
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,190
- He must be hungry.
- Doughnuts? Are you hungry?

139
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,820
He must be really hungry.

140
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,600
- Woo Jae is hungry!
- Hey.

141
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,160
This rarely happens.

142
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,840
- Doesn't he eat one meal a day?
- You said you didn't need to eat.

143
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,840
- What?
- You said you ate one meal a day.

144
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,500
He needs some sugar now.

145
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,030
I guess you've done only easy work.

146
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,650
- The sweet potato is good.
- You always sit...

147
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,400
in a studio and talk,
so you must feel hungry today.

148
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,050
- Okay.
- Is it good?

149
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,880
- I guess you like it.
- It's really good.

150
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,320
(While they all try
some twisted donuts,)

151
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,990
(the Nose Himalaya goes to his room
to warm his nose.)

152
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,250
I'm going into the warm room.

153
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,060
- I should go in.
- My nose hurts.

154
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,150
You should go in.

155
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,020
The size is just perfect.

156
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,020
Aren't you going to turn it over?

157
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
(Amazed)

158
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,430
Is this custom-made or what?

159
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,540
It's perfect.
Did you measure the size?

160
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,540
- Are we going?
- Do you have a ruler?

161
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,670
Let's just cook it now.

162
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,740
(Let's cook now
since the lid is set.)

163
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,940
Is this custom-made or what?

164
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,110
- Tell Suk Jin to come out.
- Look at this.

165
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,000
- Gosh, this is perfect.
- Jong Kook.

166
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,320
- Call Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin!

167
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,140
- What?
- Come on out.

168
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,190
Why?

169
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,840
- What's going on?
- Come here.

170
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,290
- We will eat pork belly.
- What's up?

171
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,880
- What?
- You shouldn't do this.

172
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
You should turn it over.

173
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,150
- No, this is right.
- No.

174
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,820
This lets us drain the fat.

175
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,170
- I thought it should be flipped.
- Really?

176
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,800
If I were you,
I would've flipped it.

177
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,090
It will drain the rendered fat.

178
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,190
(Protein Kim prefers plain meat.)

179
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,390
Woo Jae.

180
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,900
Woo Jae.

181
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes?

182
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,130
Come here.

183
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,330
You know what?

184
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,500
Chun Hee, Kwang Soo, and Woo Jae.

185
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,940
- They all are similar.
- I don't like Woo Jae though.

186
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,550
Hey, the heat is high,
so you can slice it thick.

187
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,420
- Okay?
- Yes.

188
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,510
(Woo Jae is slicing
the lump of pork belly.)

189
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,790
- Do you want to wipe it with this?
- What's that?

190
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,930
- Oil.
- Try it.

191
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,860
(He wipes the lid with pork fat
before cooking.)

192
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,930
My goodness.

193
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,000
- Is it too hot?
- Look at Jong Kook.

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,590
It looks like he moved
to a rural area.

195
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,070
- Jong Kook...
- He's a lodge owner.

196
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,240
Why did you put it on here?

197
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,670
It's like a documentary show.

198
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,000
"Turbo was very popular
back in the 1990s."

199
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,380
"Why did he retire all of a sudden?"

200
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,880
I can work out
my forearm muscles this way.

201
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,490
(He went into a mountain
following the smell of firewood.)

202
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,080
Aren't you Kim Jong Kook?

203
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,820
Yes, I am. Hello.

204
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,920
(Kim Jong Kook: He's lived
in the mountains for 5 hours.)

205
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,990
Hello.

206
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,450
I was seriously ill before.

207
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,360
One day, I went into the mountains.

208
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,940
That day, I could feel
I was recovering my strength.

209
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,460
I was like, "This is it."

210
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,700
So I decided to retire and move.

211
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,680
(Looking for the idol star
from the 1990s, Kim Jong Kook)

212
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,980
This is perfect.

213
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,440
I guess I should wipe it once
before grilling the meat.

214
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,640
Shall we cook meat now?

215
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,980
No.

216
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,990
(Laughing)

217
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,440
Do you want to eat meat now?

218
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,420
I can't wait to cook it.

219
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,430
I'll prepare the ingredients
for budaejjigae now.

220
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,430
To make budaejjigae, we should just
put all the ingredients in ramyeon.

221
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,150
- I'll cut some vegetables.
- Right.

222
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,230
We can boil them all at once.

223
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,960
- We should make it together then.
- Okay.

224
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,940
- Do you need tofu now?
- Bring it.

225
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,540
This is the last onion we have.

226
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,570
(While they slice
the ham and vegetables...)

227
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,900
- Really?
- We should've bought more.

228
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,310
(Woo Jae is cutting the pork belly
in the kitchen.)

229
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,400
I see.

230
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,840
It should go
in the opposite direction.

231
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,640
I get it.

232
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,210
I got the hang of it now.

233
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,840
You're really good.

234
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,120
I guess you were
a butcher in your previous life.

235
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,450
This is better.

236
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,990
You're good at this.

237
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,820
- You're skilled.
- This is it.

238
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,930
(Glaring eyes)

239
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,320
- Jong Kook, hurry and come here.
- Why?

240
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,390
The meat is ready.

241
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,870
Okay. Hang on.

242
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,740
- We shouldn't cook it now.
- We should wait.

243
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,900
- Wait until everything is ready.
- Just put it there.

244
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,630
No, put it in the bowl.

245
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,200
Put it on...
You should bring a bowl.

246
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,050
- If you put it here, it freezes.
- No, not here.

247
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,680
- It's here.
- Hey!

248
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,180
- You can't put it down here.
- Hey!

249
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,420
Woo Jae!

250
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,010
Come to your senses.

251
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,080
If you put it here, it will freeze.

252
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,920
- Woo Jae, here.
- Put it in here.

253
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,860
- Hang on.
- Put it down.

254
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,430
Aren't you using the frying pan?

255
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,820
We don't need a frying pan.

256
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,320
- We're cooking budaejjigae.
- Put it down.

257
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,500
- Go.
- All right.

258
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,860
This is...

259
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,630
(Since they made lunch,
they now know they need water.)

260
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,190
All right. Good. We should do this.

261
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,370
We need plenty of water
because it evaporates.

262
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,460
- Right. We need enough water.
- If it's too bland,

263
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,180
- we can add ramyeon seasoning.
- Exactly.

264
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,570
- We can make it work.
- Of course.

265
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,480
We can take care of it.

266
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,880
(Those from "Family Outing"
sound confident.)

267
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,770
Hang on. We need to balance it.

268
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,940
It's no problem.

269
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,710
- It's tilted.
- Hang on. I'll take care of it.

270
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,250
This is ready.

271
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,650
We can cook dinner
faster than "Family Outing."

272
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,060
(Will they be able to enjoy dinner
with no problems this time?)

273
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,950
- Can you open the lid for me?
- Why?

274
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,500
- To put in the meat.
- Do you want to put it in?

275
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,190
- I should...
- Before the water boils?

276
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,230
Is it right that you put it in now?

277
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,690
When you cook budaejjigae,

278
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,670
you put in the ingredients first
and then add the broth.

279
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,730
Let's do that. Put it in.

280
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,270
Just boil it. Do whatever you want.

281
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,910
- Hang on.
- Here.

282
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,830
- Again...
- Then put in...

283
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,870
- Are you Captain America or what?
- Gosh.

284
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,240
Look at you.

285
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,110
No, you'd be
Captain of Entertainment.

286
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,190
- Are we using this?
- Yes.

287
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,520
- That's right.
- We don't have the broth here.

288
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
- Instead of the broth.
- She's right about that.

289
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,160
Really? Okay.

290
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,660
- For budaejjigae...
- So this is what you do.

291
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,790
All right.

292
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,930
- I don't think one is enough.
- Don't we need more?

293
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,950
- But...
- If we use more,

294
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,320
- we can't eat tteokguk tomorrow.
- It's for tteokguk.

295
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,990
- No, it's not just for that.
- We can dilute it like the broth.

296
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,800
- Right?
- Okay. We can do that.

297
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,230
You're right.
We can make broth with the meat.

298
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,940
It's good enough to make broth.

299
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,070
It's okay to use plain water.

300
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,140
(Budaejjigae Avengers use
minced meat to make broth.)

301
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,150
Let's boil it.

302
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,680
- Is it pork or beef?
- This is pork.

303
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,610
Aren't we supposed to use beef?
Is it okay to use pork?

304
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,150
- It's pork.
- Do we use pork for budaejjigae?

305
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,210
We can use pork.

306
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,890
- Shouldn't it be beef?
- I think it's beef.

307
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,150
- Beef...
- No, it's pork.

308
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,520
We can use pork
and all kinds of hams.

309
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,790
Actually, pork is...

310
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,820
Never mind. Do whatever you want.

311
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,320
Then we should
cook some rice as well.

312
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
It feels like something's missing
when we don't have rice.

313
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,830
You know we ate noodles before.
We already had a lot of carbs.

314
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,770
Sticking to just the meat
is good enough.

315
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,010
- But he...
- That's your issue, not ours.

316
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,180
- You shouldn't eat it, then.
- We have scorched rice.

317
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,970
- Scorched rice.
- Kook Jong, we...

318
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,740
- Are we at a training academy?
- Are we your fitness club members?

319
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,290
- I just mean...
- This isn't a training academy.

320
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,260
Jae Suk, it's...

321
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,160
Wait. What are you putting in?

322
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,220
- Kimchi.
- Are you putting in random things?

323
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,060
- Go ahead.
- There's kimchi in budaejjigae.

324
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,220
Budaejjigae is another mixed stew.

325
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,120
(Quietly)

326
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,830
- Seriously?
- There's kimchi in budaejjigae.

327
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,440
- Why are you grilling that?
- What are you doing?

328
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,860
If we cook it,
we'll have to eat it immediately.

329
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,230
- We have to eat.
- Our meal needs to start.

330
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,550
Once we grill the meat,
we'll have to begin our meal.

331
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,150
Meat gets cooked fast.

332
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,600
- With rice and...
- Just two strips, then.

333
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,820
Go ahead.

334
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,150
- It'll be an appetizer.
- Get grilling.

335
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,520
It's too early, though.

336
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,390
You can have that first.

337
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,110
- No way.
- The smell is divine.

338
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,950
Let's cook some rice
in the cast iron pot.

339
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,080
But it'll take too long.

340
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,120
I'll get on it.

341
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,480
You're adding
the ramyeon seasoning now?

342
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,590
Yes.

343
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,760
We just need to boil everything.

344
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,860
Hold on.
You're cooking it as you please.

345
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,860
Guys, you shouldn't be cooking it
as you see fit.

346
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,230
Are you already
adding the ramyeon seasoning?

347
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,360
First, we should do our best
to cook it without the seasoning.

348
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,730
- That's right.
- If it goes wrong,

349
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,070
we then add the ramyeon seasoning.

350
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,780
- But you already added it.
- You can't cook with it already.

351
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,510
- It's wrong.
- We can always add some more.

352
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,280
That's not what we mean.

353
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,840
That's not...
Anyway, I'll cook the rice.

354
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,940
- So Min.
- Yes?

355
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,020
Where's the rice?

356
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,610
- It's inside.
- Do we have rice?

357
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,080
- Yes, we do.
- Do we?

358
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,580
I'm good at making steamed rice.

359
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,660
(He talks the talk.)

360
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,120
(Cooking rice in a pot
isn't an easy task.)

361
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,900
(He measures the water
using the middle finger method.)

362
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,010
(Seok Sam is confident
in his ability to cook rice.)

363
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,280
(The twist will be revealed
later on.)

364
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,100
Why won't this latch?
Okay, we're good.

365
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,110
So Min, why are you in tears?

366
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,320
The spice is stinging my eyes.

367
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,690
Should it sting like this?

368
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,610
There's too much water, though.

369
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,110
Don't worry about that.
It'll boil down.

370
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,560
- Are you sure? That's a relief.
- We can add more ramyeon seasoning.

371
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Don't worry.

372
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,850
- Anything we eat...
- Anything...

373
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,620
- outdoors on a variety show...
- That's right.

374
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,960
- tastes like ramyeon anyway.
- Yes, like ramyeon.

375
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,030
Don't worry.

376
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,570
Okay, let's give it a taste.

377
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,100
(How will the broth taste?)

378
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100
Taste it.

379
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,100
- It's not ready, but...
- It seems good to me.

380
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,440
Let's see if we need more seasoning.

381
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,780
- How is it?
- It's too bland.

382
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,070
- Is it bland?
- Like crazy. This is bad.

383
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,150
- Let me see.
- We need to boil it down.

384
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,210
It's seriously bland.

385
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,390
- Then...
- Let's add more seasoning, then.

386
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,550
We need to boil this down
for a while.

387
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,660
Only then...

388
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,020
There must be too much water.
Who decided on the amount?

389
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,450
- Who...
- It wasn't me.

390
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,590
(They feign ignorance.)

391
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,160
- Hey.
- Who decided on the amount?

392
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,670
- It wasn't like that.
- Right.

393
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,190
I was going to let it boil
and evaporate first,

394
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,040
but you added
the ingredients too early.

395
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,690
- Who added the ingredients?
- You.

396
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,170
No, it wasn't me.

397
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,680
- It was So Min, then.
- What's going on?

398
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,230
Who gave you the order?

399
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,510
- The water?
- That's right.

400
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,570
I didn't decide
on the amount of water.

401
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,740
You should've checked
before adding in the ingredients.

402
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,840
- I said it was too much, but...
- You should've taken some out.

403
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,740
You added the ingredients
before the water could evaporate.

404
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,660
- The water...
- That's right.

405
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
(Can this be salvaged?)

406
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,530
- Who was this irresponsible?
- I said it was too much water.

407
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,220
(Woo Jae has been quietly
grilling the meat.)

408
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,350
Once this is done, we need to eat it
along with the sauce.

409
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,930
- Look at this.
- Or else, this will burn.

410
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,300
Who added these strips?

411
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,230
Why are you grilling the meat
when nothing is ready?

412
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,670
You said you were only
going to grill two strips.

413
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,700
This wasn't me.
I only added the two strips.

414
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,470
- Who was it, then?
- Who was it?

415
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,100
(Who added all this meat?)

416
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,340
- Who was it, then?
- Who was it?

417
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,380
- It was me.
- Why?

418
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,250
I thought we were grilling the meat.

419
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,750
Make sure you don't
add the preserver too.

420
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,070
I'll start grilling the meat
once that goes in.

421
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,570
Is it time?

422
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,470
(No one heard
the bomb Ji Hyo dropped.)

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,770
(And so the meat
got lined up on the lid.)

424
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,980
(Ji Hyo covered the surface
with strips of meat.)

425
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,640
(Proudly)

426
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,950
- It wasn't time for that.
- Nothing is cooked...

427
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,750
including the rice.

428
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,250
- This is bad.
- But...

429
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,250
I thought it was time
since Woo Jae was grilling some.

430
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,230
- That's only because...
- Why are you causing trouble?

431
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,960
- I thought it was time.
- Didn't I say it about ten times?

432
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,990
Why did you bring more
when there isn't enough space?

433
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,100
(There's no more space.)

434
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,230
Woo Jae, we only grilled the meat
just to get an earful.

435
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,840
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

436
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,870
They may have yelled at us,

437
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,370
but they'll enjoy the meat
once we give it to them.

438
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Probably, right?

439
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,010
It smells delicious though.

440
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,220
How good can it be
when it's no longer moist?

441
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,350
This is insane. It's to die for.

442
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,190
- Is it good?
- Try one.

443
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,190
Haha, have one.

444
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,830
I'm not easy to please
since I own a barbecue restaurant.

445
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,330
- I get it, but...
- He's right.

446
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,490
Let's have it
before it gets overcooked.

447
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,390
Gosh, the smoked flavor.

448
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,630
Isn't it good?

449
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,230
(That's what I'm talking about.)

450
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,100
- It's nice and chewy.
- It's absolutely delicious.

451
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,550
(It's so good
that they have forgotten...)

452
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,980
(about giving them
an earful earlier.)

453
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,780
- See? They love it.
- Right.

454
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,850
We made the right choice.

455
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,930
(The duo's grilled pork belly
got everyone's approval.)

456
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,090
We did a good job.

457
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,100
We should have this right now.

458
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,260
Have some of the meat.

459
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,300
What about the budaejjigae?

460
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
(What about the budaejjigae?)

461
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,730
We'll have to keep it boiling.

462
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,940
We'll have it tomorrow.

463
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,860
(It'll need to boil
for at least a day.)

464
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,030
I guess we can end our meal
with just that.

465
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,080
- Suk Jin, is the rice cooking?
- Yes.

466
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,350
- Did you turn on the stove?
- The rice?

467
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,920
It'll be undercooked
since we're out in the wild.

468
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,320
That can't be helped.

469
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,110
This should've been cooked indoors.
How clueless are you?

470
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,190
What did you just say?

471
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,380
I had no choice.

472
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,280
The rice will be cooked,
so don't worry.

473
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,520
Be patient,
and you'll have your rice.

474
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,850
- We should wipe this clean.
- Right.

475
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,850
Let's see.

476
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,390
Check the color.

477
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,520
It's stinging my eyes again.

478
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,440
- That's not it.
- It's not the right color.

479
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,490
My eyes are watering.

480
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,870
It'll taste nice
once it's seasoned properly.

481
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,000
How does it taste?

482
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,100
It tastes a little weird.

483
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,480
It's weird?

484
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,610
- In what way?
- Try some yourself.

485
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,420
(So Min gives it a taste.)

486
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,820
- It tastes weird.
- Right? But you can't explain why.

487
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,590
- Try some.
- It's bland.

488
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,880
It's finding its way, though.

489
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,480
It tastes like ramyeon cooked
with too much water.

490
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,620
(1st sign of trouble:
The bland budaejjigae)

491
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,330
- Jong Kook, it's too hot!
- Jong Kook!

492
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,330
- What is it?
- The fire's too hot.

493
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,800
You're burning the meat.

494
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,390
See what I mean?
You have to eat it right away,

495
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,730
but you started grilling the meat
when we weren't ready.

496
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,490
(It's a mess.)

497
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,600
- It's a mess.
- Tell me about it.

498
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,970
(I thought we'd be having
an early dinner.)

499
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,210
- Transfer the meat.
- The flavors are there,

500
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,440
but it's bland.

501
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,050
- The flavors are there.
- I should get this indoors.

502
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,210
Suk Jin, where are you going?

503
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Where are you going?

504
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,980
It shouldn't be cooked outdoors.

505
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,880
- Why not?
- It's just what Haha said.

506
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,420
- It won't be cooked through.
- It'll be fine.

507
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,880
It'll burn at the bottom,
and nothing will be cooked.

508
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,750
It'll be fine. By the way,
who put you in charge?

509
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,390
Why are you trying
to order everyone around?

510
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,100
Are you the owner of this place?

511
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,490
- I own a barbecue restaurant.
- Are you kidding me?

512
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,860
This is laughable by my standards.

513
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,970
Let's compromise.

514
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,300
I'll cook it at a place that is
half indoors and half outdoors.

515
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,470
- Right here.
- That seems like the place.

516
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,500
Happy now?

517
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,030
(The rice will be cooked
on the daecheong maru.)

518
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,730
The meat... Woo Jae!

519
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,710
- Yes?
- I noticed that you burned it.

520
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,320
It's worse now.

521
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,770
(It's heavily burnt.)

522
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,320
- Do you enjoy black meat?
- Despite...

523
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,010
- Did you burn it some more?
- This is pork from a black pig.

524
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,880
- Are you kidding me?
- It's black meat.

525
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
- It was burnt earlier on as well.
- Why did you want more fire?

526
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,660
- It was perfect a while ago.
- It's nice and crispy though.

527
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,700
Woo Jae, let me speak.

528
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,790
It didn't turn black
because you burned it.

529
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,200
The soot from the flames
transferred onto the meat.

530
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,700
It's soot, so wipe it clean.

531
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,870
Wipe it with the chunk of fat.

532
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,110
- Wipe it clean.
- The barbecue restaurant owners...

533
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,410
aren't showing any mercy.

534
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,950
It will burn on the outside
but remain uncooked.

535
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,770
It won't be cooked thoroughly.

536
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,150
Black water is dripping from this.

537
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,340
(The pork is turning into coal.)

538
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,480
It's the soot.

539
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,010
Ji Hyo, wipe down
this side of the lid.

540
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,580
Ji Hyo, why can't you stop sniffing?

541
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,090
- When the fire dials down...
- Put this on.

542
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,930
Right, of course.

543
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,590
- Put this on.
- I forgot.

544
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,760
Let's grill the next batch
once the fire dials down.

545
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,260
Wipe the lid clean
with chunks of fat.

546
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,380
What you're seeing is soot.

547
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,410
- I agree.
- There's too much water...

548
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,500
in the budaejjigae.

549
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
- It's bland and tasteless.
- Let's leave the lid open.

550
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,540
- Take off the lid.
- And boil it down.

551
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,980
- If we keep the lid open...
- We need to boil it down.

552
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,080
- The water will evaporate.
- It needs to be boiled down.

553
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,120
Let's keep it open.

554
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,010
Just like before.
It was beginning to boil down.

555
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,780
Let's do this as well.

556
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,660
- If we keep it open...
- Add some more ham.

557
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,360
We have enough for the entire staff.

558
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,250
- It could feed 50 people.
- You keep making more.

559
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,260
(It is enough
for approximately 50 people.)

560
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,970
We could open
a buffet for the staff.

561
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,830
This isn't
your ordinary budaejjigae.

562
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,290
It's budaejjigae
made in a cast iron pot.

563
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,170
It's not the kind
you get to normally eat.

564
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,170
Actually...

565
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,300
- You can feed a whole squad.
- Exactly.

566
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,950
I mean, when we made lunch earlier,

567
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,110
Ji Hyo put in six months' worth
of anchovies.

568
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,270
If we run a restaurant, it'd fail
because of the cost of ingredients.

569
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,080
You wouldn't even last a month
if you run a restaurant like this.

570
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,250
(They should never start
a restaurant business.)

571
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,250
I put in two packs of meat.
Gosh, my eyes are burning.

572
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,390
Haha, see if we need more ham
if you can see inside.

573
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,390
- I can't see.
- Move.

574
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,590
Can you see inside?
It hurts my eyes.

575
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,130
- Hey, I can't... Gosh.
- Have a look for me.

576
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,670
- See if we have enough meat in it.
- I can't see anything.

577
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,870
Give me that. Hold this for me.

578
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,440
- How do I hold it? Hold on.
- Hold this part.

579
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,530
- You can hold this part.
- I think it's enough.

580
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,140
- Have a look. Wait.
- Move aside.

581
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,170
- Take a look. My eyes are burning.
- Oh, my. It's amazing.

582
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,610
- Do we need more ham?
- Gosh, it's too hot.

583
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,270
(Screaming)

584
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,380
(He touched the broth in the ladle.)

585
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
(It's an emergency situation.)

586
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,840
- What's wrong? Tell me.
- He burned his finger.

587
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
(An unexpected accident happened
because of the smoke.)

588
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,920
What's the matter?

589
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,010
Why would you put your finger in it?

590
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,360
- I can see it now.
- Are you okay?

591
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,190
(Screaming)

592
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,730
Gosh, that fool.
What's wrong with him?

593
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,550
My eyes are burning like crazy.
This is killing me.

594
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,290
- Give me that. Hang on.
- Gosh, my eyes are stinging.

595
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,320
What did you do?

596
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,630
(All sorts of unusual sights unfold
while they make budaejjigae.)

597
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,640
Hey, I can see it now.

598
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,470
- I can see it.
- Right. I can see it too. Wait.

599
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,410
- Hey, I can see it.
- I can see it too.

600
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,000
This is enough for us
and all of our staff members.

601
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,180
(She keeps tasting the food
without making any changes.)

602
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,000
Hey, it's getting better and better.

603
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,340
- Really?
- Let's boil it down more.

604
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,650
- Does it taste okay now?
- No, it's not okay.

605
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,950
But it's getting better.

606
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,540
- Don't worry. Just trust me.
- We'll make it work. Don't worry.

607
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,890
- I'll trust you.
- I'll adjust the taste at the end.

608
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,190
Don't you worry.

609
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,820
- We should add more ham, right?
- Absolutely. Gosh.

610
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
- We'll end up eating ramyeon.
- We should add more ham.

611
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,960
- Don't add more ham, So Min.
- Then what should we add?

612
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,460
Put in some pork belly instead.

613
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,870
- Hey.
- Oh, dear. Your nose is running.

614
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,060
- Trust me. Put in some pork belly.
- It's better, right?

615
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,370
- It doesn't have enough flavor.
- But I put in a lot of meat.

616
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,060
- We should put in pork belly.
- That's why they use bone broth.

617
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,370
- To enhance the taste.
- It doesn't have the ham flavor.

618
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,800
- So we should put in pork belly.
- Then let's add beef bone broth.

619
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,440
- But we should add more ham too.
- No.

620
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,740
- Yes. Let's put in all of the ham.
- Then add more ham.

621
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,180
Let's put in a chunk of pork belly.

622
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,380
- Suk Jin, put in pork belly.
- I'll put it in secretly.

623
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,890
Shall we put in some pork neck?

624
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,190
Should I pretend I didn't hear that?
That he'll put in pork neck?

625
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
Open this.

626
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,580
Just put in whatever you want.

627
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,160
- No, don't put it in.
- It's okay.

628
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,690
- You shouldn't put it in.
- Trust me just this once.

629
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,730
- You shouldn't put in fat.
- Trust me.

630
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,860
- It's not fat. It's meat.
- I mean...

631
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,230
- It's not all fat.
- My gosh.

632
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,440
- Come on. That's not right.
- Jae Suk.

633
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,170
- Trust me on this.
- No, you're wrong.

634
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,370
- It'll make the broth taste better.
- No. You shouldn't put that in.

635
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,760
Don't put that in.

636
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,380
- Gosh. He drives me crazy.
- You use beef to make budaejjigae.

637
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,880
- The broth... Listen, Suk Jin.
- They put bacon in it.

638
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
- Right. Absolutely no.
- This is my wish.

639
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,180
- Suk Jin, come on.
- This is my wish.

640
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,890
Come on. Hey, I just...

641
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,460
- I won't let you.
- I just want to make it tasty.

642
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,780
- Please.
- No.

643
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,980
- Ramyeon seasoning will do that.
- I'll do that.

644
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
- I'll make it tasty.
- Hey, help me persuade them.

645
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,630
- Let's put in just a small piece.
- Don't worry. Add more ham.

646
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,250
I'll cut the ham into smaller pieces
and put them in.

647
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,020
Hey, can you cut this too
while you're at it?

648
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,760
- Okay. Just a moment.
- Pork neck?

649
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,870
Put it in along with the ham.
It'll make the broth tasty.

650
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,970
- Okay. I'll give it to you.
- Put it in with the ham.

651
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,070
- Place the meat under the ham.
- Put the pork neck under the ham.

652
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,270
What's the reason?

653
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,150
- You put it under the ham, right?
- Yes. Put them in all together.

654
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,800
- They won't know.
- Right.

655
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,770
- We enjoyed it, so it's okay.
- True.

656
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,690
Suk Jin, bring it here.

657
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,390
- He got caught.
- Bring it here.

658
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,190
(He got caught right away.)

659
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,080
- Show me.
- He got caught. He's in trouble.

660
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,820
- Show me.
- What? Those are sausages.

661
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,790
- Show me now. I can see it.
- Why?

662
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,660
- What do you mean?
- I can see the pork.

663
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,730
- Show me.
- I said to put it at the bottom.

664
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,470
I can see it. Why would you hide it?

665
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,940
- Let's just add ham, not the meat.
- Right. Just add more ham.

666
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,640
I think we used too much water.

667
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,910
- Let's add two seasoning sachets.
- Let's do that later.

668
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,070
- Okay.
- Then let's add this first.

669
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,240
- Right. Open the lid.
- Open it for me.

670
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,070
- Let me add just the ham.
- Open the lid.

671
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,180
- I'll do it. Just a moment.
- He caught me.

672
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,150
- I can never fool him.
- Good.

673
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,390
I'll just add in the ham,
not the meat.

674
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,620
Gosh. I can't see anything. Hey...

675
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,160
- Oh, no. The seasoning.
- No. It fell into the cauldron.

676
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,930
- Oh, gosh. Hey. The seasoning.
- No. It fell into the cauldron.

677
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,230
(He dropped the whole sachet.)

678
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,170
- Hey, the seasoning will dissolve.
- Gosh. I can't see anything.

679
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,290
- Hurry up and take it out.
- Give me the ladle. Move.

680
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,760
- I'll do it. Move.
- Okay.

681
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,440
- I can't see anything.
- Darn it!

682
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,500
(The sachet is being boiled
with the other ingredients.)

683
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,270
- Gosh, seriously.
- Take it out.

684
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,980
- Okay. I found it.
- There's another sachet in there.

685
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,070
- One more.
- One more. Take it out.

686
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,500
- There's one more.
- Where is it?

687
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,540
- Okay. I found it.
- There's another sachet in there.

688
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,740
- One more.
- One more.

689
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,340
- Take it out. There's another one.
- There's another sachet.

690
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,150
- You take one more out.
- Where is it?

691
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,450
Why would you turn on
the flashlight?

692
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,620
There's one more, Haha.

693
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,050
- I found it.
- Hey, wait.

694
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,020
- This is bad.
- Hurry up and take it out.

695
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,360
No. Wait. This is... Hang on.

696
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,320
- Hey, step aside.
- Give me the fan. Now.

697
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,750
The fan won't do.

698
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,990
No. Just move.

699
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,170
- Gosh. What should we do?
- This is driving me nuts.

700
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,370
Hey, let's take the cauldron out.

701
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,060
Oh... No, that's not it.
Oh, there it is. Take this out.

702
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,370
- Where is it?
- There. On your right. Yes. Okay.

703
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,440
- Yes, Ji Hyo, that's it.
- Okay.

704
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,800
It's all good now.

705
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,880
(Ji Hyo took the sachet out
with tenacity.)

706
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,000
It's not easy to make budaejjigae.
I'm worried.

707
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

708
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,380
You owe us an apology.

709
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,740
I'm sorry. I apologize.

710
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,050
But I couldn't see suddenly.

711
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,920
Making budaejjigae is
stressing me out.

712
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,020
If we have too many,
give some to Jae Suk and Suk Jin.

713
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,860
- So Min, what are you adding now?
- Ham.

714
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,490
- How much more ham will you add?
- So Min, can I have one?

715
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,970
That's enough ham for 50 people.

716
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,530
- Put it all in.
- We're supposed to use beef.

717
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,170
- Don't drop the desiccant.
- Be careful.

718
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,530
- They keep adding ingredients.
- Add all the ingredients you want.

719
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,710
This is enough to feed
all of our staff members.

720
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,980
Who put in tofu?

721
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,740
- It's not tofu. It's ham.
- Really?

722
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,180
That's a big piece of ham.

723
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,650
- It's as big as a block of tofu.
- Simmer it...

724
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,010
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

725
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,650
Can you open
two sachets of seasoning?

726
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,280
- Let's put in noodles at the end.
- Of course.

727
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,250
I have more seasoning here.
I collected the seasoning.

728
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,400
Let's add more seasoning. Wait.

729
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,960
Hold on. I think it's enough.

730
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,370
(He's putting in the fifth sachet
of ramyeon seasoning.)

731
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,170
Oh, the color of the broth
looks good now.

732
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,640
- I told you so. Hey, put it in.
- It looks good now.

733
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,530
- Okay. I'm about to do so.
- Put in the vegetable flakes.

734
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,680
- Is it better now?
- Yes, it's better than before.

735
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,380
Jae Suk, how about we boil it down
a little bit?

736
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,880
- I think we should boil it down.
- Shall we? It's totally different.

737
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,920
- Absolutely.
- It's different now.

738
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,570
Let's boil it down with the lid off
even though it'll be hard.

739
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,080
- Right. Let's do that.
- It's not just like ramyeon.

740
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,620
I must say,
the seasoning made it taste better.

741
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,780
- It worked.
- Yes, it's much better.

742
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,980
Hey, hurry up and scoop rice.
We can eat the food now.

743
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,280
(All that's left is
rice cooked in a pot.)

744
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,360
Rice...

745
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,060
The flame is too weak.

746
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,640
Hey, about the rice...
The flame is too weak to cook rice.

747
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,560
That's why I told you
to cook it inside.

748
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,030
I mean, the flame is too weak.

749
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,880
Why won't the rice cook?

750
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
(He brings it indoors two hours
after he started cooking it.)

751
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,650
I think the rice isn't cooking.

752
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,650
(He brings it indoors two hours
after he started cooking it.)

753
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,720
It's strange. What's wrong?

754
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,510
Suk Jin, you shouldn't open the lid
while cooking rice like that.

755
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,150
But it looks strange.

756
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,550
Should I add some water?

757
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,320
What's wrong with the rice?

758
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:53,730
(He adds water.)

759
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,590
(He adds water
three times in total.)

760
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,560
How's cooking rice going?

761
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,730
Why is the flame that weak?
That's strange.

762
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,730
(He added cold water
when it wasn't boiling.)

763
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,180
(And he keeps opening the lid.)

764
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,770
Oh, gosh. I'm worried.
It won't cook.

765
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,340
(He comes back with a worried look.)

766
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,270
My gosh. I can't believe this.

767
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,650
So Min.

768
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,310
Can you come and help me cook rice?

769
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,250
- Okay.
- I ruined it.

770
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,250
- Suk Jin, okay. I'll do that.
- Can you?

771
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,780
- Can you save it?
- I'll try.

772
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,960
Wait.

773
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
(Ms. Jeon, the master of cooking
rice in a pot, appears.)

774
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,060
- Oh, I don't think I can save it.
- I couldn't...

775
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,630
The rice won't cook.

776
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,640
- I couldn't do it.
- It's undercooked.

777
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,670
And the flame is too weak.

778
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,140
- That's the problem. Sorry?
- Have you tried changing the gas?

779
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,730
You should put a stone on the pot
to put pressure on it.

780
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,270
- Really?
- Yes. To make the lid heavy.

781
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,070
You should put something heavy
to cook rice.

782
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,270
We need to press the lid,
but we have nothing to use to do so.

783
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,840
- I'm worried. It won't taste good.
- Right. It won't taste good.

784
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,180
(They use a bowl for now.)

785
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,660
- Look. It finally started boiling.
- Yes.

786
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,460
It's finally boiling.
I see steam at last. Gosh.

787
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,750
Hey, when will the food be ready?

788
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,550
Is the rice ready?

789
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,470
- No. Actually...
- I don't think we can eat that.

790
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,490
I think we should cook rice again.

791
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,170
(He confessed honestly.)

792
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,560
- Can you give me more time?
- My gosh. Suk Jin.

793
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,680
- What do you mean by that?
- Give me some more time.

794
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,980
- We need to start eating now.
- Can you give me more time?

795
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,480
- What happened to the rice?
- So Min, why are you grabbing it?

796
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,910
- What happened to the rice?
- The flame...

797
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,510
- was too weak to boil it.
- The flame was so weak.

798
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,390
- The rice is...
- How is the rice right now?

799
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,890
It's not cooked yet.
We have to wait for a long time.

800
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,690
- Is it undercooked?
- We'll have no meat when it's done.

801
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,630
Then we should borrow
some cooked rice.

802
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,160
- What's that?
- Chocolate cookies.

803
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,960
- What are you doing? Hey.
- What is it?

804
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,430
What are you doing?
We're about to have dinner.

805
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,470
Stop eating snacks.

806
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,670
Why are you eating it?

807
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,670
Kids get scolded by their parents
when they do that.

808
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,440
We ran out of oil.

809
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,070
Why would you eat cookies
instead of meat, Woo Jae?

810
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,180
Didn't you say
we started cooking too early?

811
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,880
- Right. I'm glad we did that.
- The sun is going down.

812
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,480
It was bright outside
when we started cooking.

813
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,080
I want to go home.

814
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
I miss my mom.

815
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,050
I want to lie down in my bed.

816
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,080
I bet everyone feels the same way.

817
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,990
And the viewers must think,

818
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,090
"I must say,
there's no place like home."

819
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,830
- We're giving them a lesson.
- Yes, you can say that.

820
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,830
This is a great show.

821
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,530
Right.
You feel most comfortable at home.

822
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,370
(The sun has set already.)

823
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,270
(The human pressure cooker siblings...)

824
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,150
(have been taking turns
pressing the pot.)

825
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,150
Let's stir the rice and check it.

826
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,150
(The 1st check after 15 minutes)

827
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,980
- Should you put a stone on it?
- Anything to put pressure on it.

828
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,340
It's hard to cook rice in a pot.

829
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,250
Is it good?

830
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,390
- It's good.
- I guess it's not bad.

831
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,520
We saved it.

832
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,660
- We saved the rice, right?
- It's good.

833
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,200
- Is the rice good?
- Is the rice good?

834
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
Yes, it's good.

835
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,470
- It's good.
- We're like a rice rescue team.

836
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,330
- Do you want to taste it?
- We can eat this now.

837
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,760
(Meanwhile, the budaejjigae...)

838
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,910
It'll be too salty later.
We have to eat it now.

839
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,270
- Really?
- Scoop the rice.

840
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,380
- Are you sure?
- It's just right. I just said so.

841
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,570
I said it was just right.

842
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,800
It's not just okay. It's amazing.

843
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,380
It's done. It's amazing.

844
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,510
- We're done. Put out the fire.
- It's crazy good.

845
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,920
- It shouldn't boil down anymore.
- It's done.

846
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,920
- Scoop the rice!
- It'll get too salty.

847
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,190
- I want to taste it too.
- Let's take it away from the stove.

848
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,360
- Hurry up and take it away.
- It's good.

849
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,780
Oh, my. It looks so good.

850
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,780
(The budaejjigae
miraculously became tasty.)

851
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,900
It looks great right now.

852
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,700
It's good. It tastes as it should.

853
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,900
- My, it looks amazing.
- This is a good meal.

854
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,430
It's good.
Suk Jin, it's cooked to perfection.

855
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,870
Where else could we have food
like this?

856
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,530
- Hey, Muscle.
- Let's sit close to one another.

857
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,870
- Yes, Jae Suk.
- Let's eat.

858
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,870
- Come here.
- Come here.

859
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,440
(They sit around the tables
and enjoy a hearty meal.)

860
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,500
- The pork belly is crazy good.
- Ji Hyo, come and eat up.

861
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,040
The pork belly is so good.

862
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,150
- It's crispy outside, soft inside.
- We should cook the rest.

863
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,150
Try a piece of pork belly with rice.

864
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,450
The rice is cooked
to perfection as well.

865
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,690
- The rice is okay too.
- It's so good.

866
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,920
- Pork belly.
- So Min did a great job.

867
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,510
- Woo Jae, come here and eat up.
- Okay.

868
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,820
- Woo Jae, come here.
- Look at him.

869
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,160
I knew he wouldn't eat the food
when he ate the chocolate cookie.

870
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,750
(Slurping)

871
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,590
Oh, my. It's so tasty.
I'm impressed.

872
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,290
The pork belly is crazy good.

873
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,560
Ji Hyo, come and eat.

874
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,700
The budaejjigae is so tasty.

875
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,110
I was surprised
when I tasted the budaejjigae.

876
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,880
Oh, my. What happened to it?
It's so delicious.

877
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,000
- The budaejjigae is so good.
- He did a good job. Isn't it good?

878
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,270
- Isn't it amazing?
- Haha, you should...

879
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,540
sell this. It's incredibly good.

880
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,980
- How much should a bowl be?
- How much?

881
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,510
- About 110 dollars. Considering...
- Really?

882
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,240
I cried so many tears
while making it.

883
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,920
We used the ingredients
that were worth 200 dollars, right?

884
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,250
- It was made with craftsmanship.
- How tasty.

885
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,660
And it has a rich flavor
as I wanted.

886
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,820
Because we used ingredients
that were worth 200 dollars.

887
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,930
- And because we're eating together.
- I agree.

888
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,170
(Woo Jae delivers the meat
that he cooked.)

889
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,490
How sweet. Look at Woo Jae.

890
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,140
(Woo Jae delivers the meat
that he cooked.)

891
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,440
If we cook like this,
a day would pass by quickly.

892
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,440
The meat that he just cooked is
so good.

893
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,000
Why won't you bring any meat
to our table?

894
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,410
- Why? What's the reason?
- Sorry?

895
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,220
You didn't bring any meat
to our table.

896
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,120
- I'm bringing you meat now.
- I only ate one piece.

897
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,510
(He brings a few pieces
as Jong Kook complains.)

898
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,620
Here you go.

899
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,580
- But why? Do you not like us?
- It's not like that.

900
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,630
Is there someone you hate among us?

901
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,990
(Is there someone you hate
among us?)

902
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,130
Who is it?

903
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,550
Why would you do that?

904
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,290
- I wonder who it is.
- Tell us why.

905
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,870
He keeps doing that. Earlier on...

906
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,140
(What?)

907
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,800
(They pause
and give each other a fierce glare.)

908
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,910
My, that's fierce.

909
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,800
- I kept eating like this.
- Right.

910
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,530
- You know that, right?
- It's fierce.

911
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,380
(The two of them finished
their silent conversation.)

912
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,920
It feels like
we've been rewarded for our effort.

913
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,380
- It was so good.
- Because the food was so good.

914
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,650
- I'm happy that we pulled it off.
- Everything was really tasty.

915
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,460
- We all enjoyed our dinner.
- It was a good meal.

916
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,780
Yes, it was successful!

917
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,360
- We made it!
- We really enjoyed it.

918
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,820
- Hey.
- Why...

919
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,700
Who stepped on the back of my shoe?

920
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,590
(The back of Haha's shoe is folded.)

921
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,230
- Who did this?
- Who...

922
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,230
- Who else would do that?
- Was it you, Woo Jae?

923
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,670
That's not yours.

924
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,870
Hey, leave it. That's mine.

925
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,140
(They finished their dinner
at 9:40 p.m.)

926
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,110
- I'm so full.
- I feel like my stomach will burst.

927
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,800
- Let's clean up first.
- Okay.

928
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,340
Let's play a game.

929
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,770
- Let's decide by ourselves.
- We should play a game.

930
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,570
You can play any game you want.

931
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,390
- Let's...
- Will the loser clean up or what?

932
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,190
- Let's choose four people.
- Four?

933
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,160
- Okay. Let's do that.
- Four people will be enough.

934
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,930
We can play palm face down or up
to choose four losers.

935
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,280
- Okay. Let's do that.
- Okay.

936
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,360
- Get ready.
- Oh, my gosh.

937
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,630
- All right. Then...
- Okay.

938
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,630
Palm face down or up.

939
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,630
Gosh, I'm nervous.

940
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,590
- Let's begin.
- The four of us with the same side.

941
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,790
- Those four get to rest.
- They're the losers.

942
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,990
- They get to rest?
- No, they're the losers.

943
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,700
- They're the losers.
- They should clean up.

944
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,140
- The rest three get to rest.
- That's correct.

945
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,030
- The team of 3 wins.
- The team of 3 gets to rest.

946
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,680
- The team of 4 loses.
- The 4 of them should clean up.

947
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,880
- Palm face down or up
- Palm face down or up

948
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,720
- No.
- There are five of them.

949
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,450
- We have to do it again.
- This is no joke.

950
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
- Now...
- Let's do it again.

951
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,510
- The team of 4 and the team of 3?
- Correct.

952
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,960
- Palm face down or up
- Palm face down or up

953
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,730
Okay. We've got the losers.

954
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,490
- One, two, three, four.
- Wait. What?

955
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,990
Oh, yes! We won!

956
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,590
(Jae Suk, Ji Hyo, and Jong Kook
survived.)

957
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,320
(They're free from doing the dishes
in the cold weather.)

958
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,440
Let's go.

959
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,030
We won the Best Couple Award
for a reason.

960
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,640
- Oh, yes!
- The Best Couple Award winners!

961
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,110
- Guys!
- Okay!

962
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,380
(Chucking bitterly)

963
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,340
(Suk Jin, Haha, So Min, and Woo Jae
will do the dishes and tidy up.)

964
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,310
- Well...
- The Best Couple Award winners!

965
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,740
- Let's leave 1 person out.
- How about 2 people?

966
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,040
- Let's leave 2 people out.
- Let's just leave 1 person out.

967
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
- Let's leave 1 person out.
- Just 1 person.

968
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,620
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

969
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,720
- Just 1 person will be left out?
- Just 1 person.

970
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,860
- You guys are playing another game?
- One person.

971
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,480
- Yes.
- One winner, right?

972
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,890
- Just 1 person.
- Let's leave 1 person out.

973
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,050
- One winner.
- One winner, okay?

974
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,520
- There's only one winner, okay?
- I just said so.

975
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,590
- No.
- Just one person will be exempt.

976
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,820
- Palm face down or up
- Palm face down or up

977
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,640
Let's go inside. It's cold outside.

978
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,170
- Let's choose 2 people.
- Let's make it 2.

979
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,260
- Two people?
- Yes.

980
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,330
Yes. Two people will be enough
to do that much work.

981
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,710
If there are three,
it'll be hard to divide the work.

982
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,710
- So Min.
- I have a feeling that I'll lose.

983
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,300
Because if there are three people
working together,

984
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,880
- we'll bump into each other.
- I have a feeling that I'll lose.

985
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,920
- Hey, you'll go with another round?
- It's too much work for two people.

986
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,390
- It's too much work for two people.
- It'll be too much work.

987
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,620
- It'll be too crowded.
- Just one of us will be exempt?

988
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,220
- Yes.
- Would there be two winners then?

989
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,360
- Palm...
- Suk Jin.

990
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,930
(Would there be two winners then?)

991
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,360
(Seom Sam became overly sensitive
and answered in a prickly way.)

992
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,970
- What's wrong with you?
- Why would you get annoyed?

993
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,400
Why did you do that to So Min?

994
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,990
Just think about it, So Min.

995
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,870
Just try to think.

996
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,110
- Could one person do all the work?
- He's being overly sensitive.

997
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,260
- Go ahead.
- So Min.

998
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,180
- Begin the game.
- It'll be hard to do it alone.

999
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,680
The person
who throws the other side wins.

1000
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,070
Okay.

1001
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,450
- Palm face down or up
- Palm face down or up

1002
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,270
- You were too slow. Do it quickly.
- I wasn't.

1003
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,770
- Throw it quickly.
- No, I wasn't slow.

1004
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,120
Palm face down or up

1005
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,950
- Oh, my. Woo Jae is the winner.
- Hey, Woo Jae.

1006
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,080
Me? For real?

1007
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,480
Palm face down or up

1008
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,320
(Woo Jae survived.)

1009
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,730
I won. Oh, yes!

1010
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,250
(Sardine is elated.)

1011
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,930
- Oh, my. Woo Jae is the winner.
- Me? For real?

1012
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,560
(Seok Sam and So Min lost.)

1013
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,060
- I'm saved. I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

1014
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,670
- I thought I lost.
- I told you that.

1015
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,770
- I knew he would win.
- My gosh. I can't believe this.

1016
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,300
This is the worst.

1017
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,610
- This is the worst.
- Hey, you can do it alone.

1018
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,240
- My gosh.
- Hey.

1019
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,070
- You can do it alone, So Min.
- So Min.

1020
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,270
- I've done it before. It's doable.
- Hey, So Min.

1021
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,310
Make your choice.
What do you want to do?

1022
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,720
- You can do it alone.
- Make your choice. It's up to us.

1023
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,890
- It'll take too much time.
- What do you want to do?

1024
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:40,890
What do you think?

1025
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,690
- Let's do it together.
- Right. Do it together.

1026
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,960
- Let's do it together.
- Right. You can't do it alone.

1027
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,130
Now, we'll add more slots
on the roulette.

1028
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,030
- The camera team chose the members.
- I wonder about the reason.

1029
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,030
They chose the members
who were worth filming.

1030
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,210
(The camera team chose the members
who were worth filming.)

1031
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,800
- Haha, So Min...
- Oh, I see.

1032
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,880
(Jae Suk)

1033
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,000
Woo Jae.

1034
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,270
(Woo Jae)

1035
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,210
Thank you.

1036
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,240
- The Nose Himalaya.
- I feel honored.

1037
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,340
- Of course.
- That was funny, indeed.

1038
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,740
The meat is good.

1039
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,610
Right. That was a legendary scene.

1040
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,280
We'll spin this roulette
tomorrow morning,

1041
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,360
- and the winners will win the gold.
- Really?

1042
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,690
- I see. The more slots, the better.
- It's important.

1043
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,300
- Of course, it's advantageous.
- Three will be chosen, right?

1044
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,070
So Min, put it between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.

1045
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,900
What is she doing?

1046
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,010
- I'm feeling dizzy.
- Why is she so spaced out?

1047
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,960
Could it be because she inhaled
too much smoke?

1048
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,880
(Could it be because she inhaled
too much smoke?)

1049
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,010
I'm serious.

1050
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,070
(Haha suspects that she inhaled
too much smoke from the fire.)

1051
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,070
- That's possible.
- I think that might be the case.

1052
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,610
Don't inhale too much smoke.

1053
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,190
- You look a little...
- It's dangerous.

1054
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,050
- Suk Jin, I'll do the dishes.
- Okay.

1055
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,650
(It's time for the weakest siblings
to do the dishes.)

1056
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,780
- Yes.
- Oh, dear.

1057
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,920
I'll start doing the dishes.

1058
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,360
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

1059
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,590
(So Min slipped and fell suddenly.)

1060
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,630
- What's with her, seriously?
- Hey, put out the fire!

1061
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,860
- So Min, stop inhaling smoke.
- What's with you?

1062
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,440
- Breathe out the smoke now.
- Why...

1063
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,610
- Breathe out the smoke you inhaled.
- So Min, what's wrong with you?

1064
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,740
She's acting so weird.

1065
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,280
So Min, what's wrong with you?

1066
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,740
- What's the matter?
- She's acting so weird.

1067
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,480
- She's laughing suddenly.
- What is it?

1068
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,840
- What is the problem?
- She startled me.

1069
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,050
(She's creating an ironic sight
by laughing with a sad face.)

1070
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,320
- That was hilarious.
- It was slippery.

1071
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,110
It's too slippery.

1072
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,490
- You inhaled too much smoke.
- She lost her mind at some point.

1073
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,130
We should go inside.

1074
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,730
Seok Sam, thank you in advance.

1075
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,420
Let's do the dishes.

1076
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,760
What should we do about this?

1077
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:31,190
We should put it in a plastic bag
and store it in the fridge.

1078
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,900
- Gosh, I'm so cold.
- It's so cold here.

1079
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,070
I'm so cold.

1080
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,610
Strangely, you and I always lose
when we decide who cleans up. Darn.

1081
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,380
- Right.
- It's so strange.

1082
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,210
It's funny
how we always get unlucky.

1083
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,300
- It's always us. How strange.
- It's really funny.

1084
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,050
We all have the same chance of winning.
Then why?

1085
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,280
It's so funny.

1086
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,840
Gosh, I'm so cold.

1087
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,740
I think the dish soap is frozen too.

1088
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,150
Gosh. Cleaning up is a lot of work
because everything is frozen.

1089
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:01,090
(So the two tiger moths tidied up
for a long while.)

1090
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,730
- Even the dish soap is frozen.
- Gosh.

1091
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,740
- I don't get it.
- I don't know.

1092
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,460
I should try to do more nice things
for others.

1093
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,960
Right.

1094
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,030
I feel refreshed now.

1095
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,710
Let's make a video call to him.

1096
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,800
(Finally, it's break time.)

1097
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,940
Yes, So Min.

1098
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,610
Hey, Se Chan.

1099
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,010
(They're talking to Se Chan
who's on standby on a video call.)

1100
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,380
What are you doing?

1101
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,940
I'm on standby at home.

1102
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,190
(I'm on standby at home.)

1103
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,990
- Se Chan.
- Yes.

1104
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,490
You will shave your face
before coming here, right?

1105
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,960
- I should shave my face.
- Okay.

1106
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,530
Your girlfriend is waiting for you.

1107
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,550
I like the melody.

1108
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,300
But you have to make tteokguk
tomorrow morning.

1109
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,650
Of course. I'll make tteokguk.

1110
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,360
Great.

1111
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,570
I'll see you later.

1112
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,590
- It's not bad, right?
- Nice.

1113
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,710
(DJ Yoo works hard even in the room.)

1114
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,530
Suk Jin is very good at whistling.

1115
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,610
Suk Jin, do you have your own trick
for whistling?

1116
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,110
Why can't I whistle like you do?

1117
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,480
You can't?

1118
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,880
I can only whistle one note.

1119
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,320
If you're good at whistling,
you wouldn't be cute. That's why.

1120
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,650
- But I want to be good at it.
- Because you're cute enough now.

1121
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,150
That's true.

1122
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,920
- You said I looked ugly earlier.
- You don't need that skill.

1123
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,400
- You said I looked ugly earlier.
- Some ugly things are cute.

1124
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,300
Things like a small lump of poop
are cute too.

1125
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,670
(Things like a small lump of poop
are cute too.)

1126
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,490
(Laughing)

1127
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,630
He was listening to me.

1128
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,510
(They won't stop teasing So Min
even during the break.)

1129
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,510
You two have
a similar sense of humor.

1130
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,510
He likes my jokes.

1131
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,280
Can I have some bread...
We have bread, right?

1132
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,010
- We have bread right here.
- Give me some.

1133
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,070
- It's warm now.
- That's good, Woo Jae.

1134
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,210
Right. Woo Jae.

1135
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,820
There's nothing in it.

1136
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,110
I think it's plain butter bread.

1137
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,590
- It has a lot of butter in it.
- Try this one, Suk Jin.

1138
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,280
Hey.

1139
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,460
(It's an empty cup.)

1140
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,130
You always prank me
when I'm starting to feel better.

1141
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,900
I didn't do that intentionally.

1142
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,630
- You just started looking adorable.
- I can't help it.

1143
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,630
She can't help it.

1144
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,940
(It's a whole new way of
giving someone a hard time.)

1145
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,510
(Laughing)

1146
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,110
Why is that funny?

1147
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,940
(Giggling)

1148
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,210
Why is that funny?

1149
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,710
(He can't stop laughing.)

1150
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,070
Suk Jin was too...

1151
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,380
(She wants to laugh with him
even in such a situation.)

1152
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,710
- I mean...
- I want to know why it's funny.

1153
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,840
Why do you find it funny? Tell me.

1154
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,010
Why else?

1155
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,610
I was just starting to adore you.
So I thought it was a shame.

1156
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,590
I was just starting to adore you.

1157
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,050
But you blew that chance right then.

1158
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,760
- Because of this.
- Exactly.

1159
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,730
You missed your chance.

1160
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,170
Why would you join them...

1161
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,460
You have a problem.

1162
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,760
She always...

1163
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,800
(A curious girl who hovers around
them despite being teased)

1164
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,980
They were having so much fun
and I was curious what it was about.

1165
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,150
You missed the chance.

1166
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,240
You could've been adored.

1167
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,920
It's because you wasted a chance.
It's because I like you.

1168
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Each kid is...

1169
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,760
Sometime later,
"Why are you not seeing them?"

1170
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,490
- Oh, my back.
- It's dangerous. Put it up there.

1171
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,550
My back hurts.

1172
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,530
She grew so much.

1173
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,130
I guess people all feel
like that when their child is young.

1174
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,130
I hated how fast my child grew.

1175
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,670
She got Na Eun's clothes.

1176
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,840
Na Eun's clothes?

1177
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,110
You got all her clothes.

1178
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,130
She wears her clothes a lot.

1179
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,710
(The dads who are weak for their
daughters are talking half awake.)

1180
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,010
Actually, you can pass on
children's clothes.

1181
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,050
They can't wear them
for a long time.

1182
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,070
Right.

1183
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,690
It was really tiring.

1184
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,550
Tteokguk or whatever, I want to
run away with a bag in the morning.

1185
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,920
Do you want to run away with me?

1186
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,730
Do you want to?

1187
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,730
The accommodation is quite far.
Do you want to run away?

1188
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,260
Let's have a drink then.

1189
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,030
Let's not even wash up and...

1190
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,710
- Come in.
- No.

1191
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,900
Come in.

1192
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,010
Why did you bring them?

1193
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,900
What is it?

1194
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,670
- Get it from her.
- It's coffee. Oh, my.

1195
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,900
- Gosh.
- What?

1196
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,710
We didn't want this much.

1197
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,550
- What's this? The table is full.
- We should work hard then.

1198
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,920
- You're telling us not to lie down.
- No. It's fine.

1199
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,690
- Take a short break.
- All right.

1200
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,420
Ji Hyo.

1201
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,090
Your hairstyle is intense.
Did you go to a beauty salon?

1202
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:56,360
- Yes.
- It's a shag cut.

1203
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,340
It's a shag cut.

1204
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,990
Ji Hyo.

1205
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,260
- You should flatten your hair.
- Your hair is intense.

1206
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,570
Your hair.

1207
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,300
- Are you a Super Saiyan?
- Will you be okay today?

1208
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,510
It's static.

1209
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,170
- That's cute.
- It's because of static.

1210
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,940
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

1211
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,670
- Yes.
- You're not, dude.

1212
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,940
You're an actress.

1213
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,780
Put on a hat or something.

1214
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,960
It's because my baby hair...

1215
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,490
- became frizzy.
- It's fine as long as you're okay.

1216
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,630
- I'm okay. Why?
- We're fine.

1217
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,900
Do I look weird, Jae Suk?

1218
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,960
(Do I look weird, Jae Suk?)

1219
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,360
- Do I look weird, Jae Suk?
- Hey.

1220
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,170
- Open your eyes wide.
- I...

1221
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,900
honestly like it
when you look funny.

1222
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,110
But I didn't hope you
to become this funny.

1223
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,510
You look so funny now.

1224
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,380
It's my baby hair that is frizzy.

1225
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,480
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

1226
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,740
- Sir.
- Yes.

1227
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,320
- I should stop watching YouTube.
- Put more firewood, will you?

1228
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,990
Yes.

1229
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,690
- The owner of the cottage...
- My eyes are going to pop out.

1230
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,320
has been watching his phone
for two hours.

1231
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,920
Have a cup of coffee, Jong Kook.

1232
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Okay.

1233
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,530
All our faces are red, aren't they?

1234
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,130
- His face is puffy too.
- I was sleepy.

1235
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,400
He didn't sleep a lot.

1236
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,400
- Your face is so puffy as well.
- I slept for two hours yesterday.

1237
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,440
You watched a soccer game.

1238
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,610
I haven't seen an attic like that
for a long time.

1239
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,260
- But...
- It's not...

1240
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,030
I'm glad that you're healthy.

1241
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,210
We'll get going now.

1242
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,900
- Okay.
- We...

1243
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,340
We should go back to Seoul
when there's less traffic.

1244
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,380
Right. You didn't have to visit me
because it's the end of the year.

1245
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,820
- I'm fine.
- There will be a traffic jam later.

1246
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,230
- You're doing good after retiring.
- Yes.

1247
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,780
You should visit me sometimes.
The rooms are all empty.

1248
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,800
- Right.
- Yes.

1249
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,420
I'm glad I came to see you though.

1250
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,730
Isn't the room warm and nice?

1251
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,170
We could come here sometimes.

1252
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,590
Yes. Visit me sometimes.

1253
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,360
- There are many rooms.
- Okay.

1254
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,570
After the award show,
you said you couldn't do it anymore.

1255
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,210
- I know.
- It's already been ten years.

1256
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:51,110
Ji Hyo,
you still don't have a boyfriend.

1257
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,210
- I'm married.
- She got married. She has a kid.

1258
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,240
Really? I didn't know.

1259
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,240
Her child is going
to elementary school.

1260
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,650
Ji Hyo, I didn't think
you would get along with us.

1261
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,650
You must've gotten married
right after I retired.

1262
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,960
- She got married immediately.
- Yes, I did.

1263
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:08,490
If I receive one more Grand Award,
I will have 30.

1264
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,570
(Bitter)

1265
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:13,030
- He kept receiving it.
- I guess you kept receiving it.

1266
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
You must've received one every year.

1267
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,210
I worked hard after that.

1268
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,940
- Right. You always do your best.
- Yes. I did my best.

1269
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,670
- Right.
- I...

1270
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,610
(Oh, my.)

1271
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,210
- Please excuse me.
- This is...

1272
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,010
This is comfortable.

1273
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,440
- For real.
- Hey.

1274
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,690
I'm so tired.

1275
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,920
- It's because I'm so tired.
- It reminds me of my grandma.

1276
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:34,730
I mean... Okay. You should get up
when I have a cramp.

1277
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,820
- I'll have a cramp.
- I get it. Because you're Suk Jin.

1278
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,550
- I'll get up when you have a cramp.
- Try this.

1279
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,070
- It smells like a grandpa.
- It's so comfortable.

1280
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,030
- It's...
- Under the...

1281
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,440
What's wrong with this?

1282
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,590
- Right.
- I'm scared.

1283
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,400
- Gosh, this is...
- Why does it keep flickering?

1284
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,530
- Right.
- Maybe we should say scary stuff.

1285
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,480
Is this scary though?
It's not weird or anything.

1286
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,300
Do you believe
there are ghosts or not?

1287
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,150
- Ghosts? I think they exist.
- They exist.

1288
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,280
- But...
- You think so?

1289
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,340
just because the light is turned off
or flickering all of a sudden,

1290
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,240
- are you scared?
- I'm scared.

1291
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,860
- It's possible. It can be scary.
- Is it not scary for you?

1292
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,320
What kind of feeling is that?
Are you scared of ghosts?

1293
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,320
I close all the doors
except for the room I sleep in.

1294
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,460
I believe ghosts exist.

1295
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,900
- I turn on all the lights.
- I'm scared.

1296
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,630
- I...
- I also close all the doors,

1297
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,320
but it's to save heating costs.

1298
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,440
You're so...

1299
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,800
I can't sleep with the door open.

1300
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,380
Because the sensor lights near
the front door would be on suddenly.

1301
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,630
- I have the same experience.
- It never happened to me. You too?

1302
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,940
- The toilet flushed itself too.
- But those things can happen.

1303
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,070
It can happen. It happened to me.

1304
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,150
I exercise at 2 or 3 in the morning
at the gym by myself.

1305
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,990
- Why?
- You're so disciplined.

1306
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,420
- That itself is scary.
- That's so scary.

1307
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,190
At 2 or 3 in the morning,
I would go there after work.

1308
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,780
- And I start working out.
- Without anyone else?

1309
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,590
And this happened before.

1310
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,460
You know the hand sanitizer
near the entrance, right?

1311
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,460
Yes.

1312
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,730
It suddenly released the sanitizer.

1313
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,130
(The automatic hand sanitizer
dispenser was turned on itself.)

1314
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,360
- It's scary.
- Exactly.

1315
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,340
And it showed the temperature.
It only shows when someone comes.

1316
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,900
I'm scared
just by listening to the story.

1317
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,800
- Are you scared?
- I would've left immediately.

1318
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,740
- I would've fainted.
- That's when I...

1319
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,940
- I would've run away.
- He would've fainted.

1320
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,550
- I won't be able to run.
- I would run to go out.

1321
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,050
- What was it?
- Are you not scared?

1322
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,050
I'm not scared of things like that.

1323
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,990
You should experience it yourself.

1324
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,420
First,
it's not scientifically proven.

1325
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:13,690
Once you're possessed
with a ghost...

1326
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,880
- You will make ghosts angry and...
- It's like...

1327
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,960
They're listening to you.

1328
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,150
- Please go to this guy today.
- It's because of you.

1329
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:25,090
Then film a video where you try
to summon a ghost for YouTube.

1330
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,240
- By himself?
- Since you don't believe it.

1331
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,570
- The ghost will come.
- They will come at night.

1332
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,110
- You'll be in trouble.
- Just with a camera by yourself...

1333
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,280
The wind is suddenly blowing.

1334
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,280
Set the camera by yourself and...

1335
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,300
He can't do it.
He would be too scared.

1336
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,800
go to a deserted house by yourself.

1337
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,050
He can't do that.

1338
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,420
- How can he do that?
- He said yes. Look at his face.

1339
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,550
- He's not scared.
- You can do it.

1340
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,710
The pen will move even when
you're not moving your hand.

1341
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,990
- How can it move?
- Will a ring move too?

1342
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,590
So try it.

1343
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:49,090
I used to do it with my friends
at school.

1344
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,530
Like, "Did you move it
or did I move it?"

1345
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,400
- Darn it.
- I told you.

1346
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,630
Like, "Did you move it
or did I move it?"

1347
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,030
(The lights suddenly turned off.)

1348
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,360
They turned it off on purpose.

1349
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,840
- No, they didn't do it on purpose.
- Hey.

1350
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,240
- Woo Jae, try it.
- Don't talk.

1351
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,590
Only the light in the room
is turned off.

1352
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:01,630
(Staff member)

1353
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,670
The electricity in the members' room
is out.

1354
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,130
(The other rooms are fine.)

1355
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,010
It's just this room.
It's fine outside.

1356
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,210
Yes. It turned off.

1357
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,480
- I can't understand.
- Look.

1358
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,010
- What's this?
- What's wrong?

1359
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,740
- Is it just this room?
- It's the loose contact.

1360
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,050
- Because today...
- Why would the contact be loose?

1361
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,990
They're using a generator for the
shoot and they run out of power.

1362
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,880
Yes. We're using
a lot of electricity.

1363
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,360
- But it's fine outside.
- But...

1364
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,530
why when we were talking
about ghosts?

1365
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,650
Why is it only this room?

1366
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,460
- It's just...
- It's been fine all this while.

1367
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,590
It started when we started
talking about ghosts.

1368
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:28,690
So...

1369
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,630
My goodness.

1370
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,300
(Peekaboo)

1371
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,440
(My goodness.)

1372
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,530
- Gosh.
- Hyung In.

1373
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,670
(Flinching)

1374
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,340
(Laughing)

1375
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,610
Why did you do that?
You got me surprised.

1376
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:40,880
Why is the light off?

1377
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,510
It really hurts.

1378
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,050
You didn't do it, right?

1379
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,710
- My gosh.
- You didn't turn it off, did you?

1380
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:48,510
That's why I told you
not to talk about scary things.

1381
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,010
- I hate scary stories.
- This is enough.

1382
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,380
I don't want to talk
about scary stuff either.

1383
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,460
There's a problem.

1384
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,550
I can't hear you.

1385
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,900
We're hearing a weird buzz too.
Don't talk about ghosts.

1386
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,050
Really?

1387
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,760
(The room with audio equipment)

1388
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,440
(They heard a buzz when he was talking
about summoning a ghost.)

1389
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:09,960
(The staff members were scared
for real.)

1390
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,170
- Why are you doing this to us?
- Why are you doing this to us?

1391
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,110
You must be joking.

1392
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,340
No. I came
because we got surprised too.

1393
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,340
Don't talk about ghosts.
I want to switch rooms.

1394
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,550
- Hey.
- I can't sleep here.

1395
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,610
Don't lie.

1396
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:23,940
- I really can't sleep.
- I'm serious.

1397
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,650
- Don't lie.
- We were monitoring together.

1398
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:26,960
- Hyung In.
- We were surprised...

1399
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,260
when we heard a buzz.

1400
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,360
Don't lie.

1401
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,590
- Stop lying.
- So I can't sleep here, Hyung In.

1402
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,800
- So Hyung In...
- It's because you used electricity.

1403
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,320
Those who will sleep here, sleep here.
I can't.

1404
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,570
- I can't sleep.
- Don't do that.

1405
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,130
They said they were using
a different generator.

1406
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,690
They're using a different generator,
but the power was out?

1407
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,260
- I know.
- Don't do it.

1408
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,510
- Don't do it.
- Hyung In.

1409
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,670
- Let those who are okay sleep here.
- Are you joking or not?

1410
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,740
And book accommodation for us.

1411
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,400
Don't do it. Just sleep here.

1412
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,010
- They're lying.
- The ghost will follow you there.

1413
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,980
- Why are you doing this to me?
- The ghost will follow you there.

1414
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,280
- I mean...
- I really can't sleep here.

1415
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,840
- Me too.
- Don't lie.

1416
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,490
- I'm serious.
- Why are you doing this?

1417
00:47:58,490 --> 00:47:59,690
I can't sleep.

1418
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:02,760
- Me neither. I'm sorry, Hyung In.
- Just sleep here.

1419
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,490
- I'll sleep in the next room.
- Why are you making it a big deal?

1420
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,420
You should sleep here though.

1421
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,670
What is she doing?

1422
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,630
- The power is back for now.
- It's okay now.

1423
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,690
It's fine now.

1424
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,990
Let's change the mood.

1425
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:15,130
This won't do.

1426
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,210
Here...

1427
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,110
It'd be better
to keep the door open.

1428
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:20,170
(Why did he open the closet?)

1429
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,670
- They're serious though.
- They're serious.

1430
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,150
- I know.
- They're really scared.

1431
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,150
Why did you fart?

1432
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,380
Hey.

1433
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,690
Why did you fart with the door open?

1434
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:28,940
Why did you fart there?

1435
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,840
I told you he wasn't scared.
Look at him farting.

1436
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,280
Why did you fart there?

1437
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,690
- You fart when you're scared.
- It's because I'm nervous.

1438
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,960
You shouldn't keep farting
while sleeping. Seriously.

1439
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:39,190
I could fart.
You can't prevent me from farting.

1440
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,360
Farting is a blessing to him.

1441
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,440
It means he digested food.

1442
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,240
You should bless him for that.

1443
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,570
(Health, happiness, blessing)

1444
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,800
Health, happiness, and blessing.
When he farts...

1445
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,940
(Thank you.)

1446
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,240
Did I have my appendix removed
or something?

1447
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,340
(After a commotion,
it already passed 12 p.m.)

1448
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:05,050
So Bal,
when is your boyfriend coming?

1449
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,320
Why is he not coming?

1450
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,630
Can you go find him?
I can't wait for him to come.

1451
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:10,880
Can we not just go to bed?

1452
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,400
I know. I'm so sleepy.

1453
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,260
(It's way passed
the usual sleeping time.)

1454
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,670
(Tapping)

1455
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:23,670
(Absurd)

1456
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,210
- Jae Suk.
- Yes, So MIn.

1457
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,800
What's taking Se Chan so long?

1458
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,570
We'll resume the shoot.

1459
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:34,510
(At that moment, the production crew
heard Se Chan was arriving.)

1460
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,150
(Turning all cameras on
in case the members greet him)

1461
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,920
One, two, three.

1462
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,050
It's so cold.

1463
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:43,280
(After a week,)

1464
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,360
Hello.

1465
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,760
(Se Chan appears
with a somewhat haggard look.)

1466
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,030
Hello.

1467
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,490
(Se Chan appears
with a somewhat haggard look.)

1468
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,670
Come here.

1469
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,800
Hello.

1470
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,400
I grew a petty mustache.

1471
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,400
Come here.

1472
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,880
- Se Chan's here.
- Se Chan must be here.

1473
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,010
He's walking around outside.

1474
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,650
Jae Suk.

1475
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,010
- Se Chan must be here.
- Se Chan's here.

1476
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,190
- Se Chan.
- Se Chan.

1477
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,590
Se Chan's here.

1478
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,400
- Are you here?
- Jae Suk and So Min are sleeping.

1479
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,190
- Give me my coffee.
- Where are you?

1480
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,570
Suk Jin.

1481
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,490
There's a karaoke machine. Nice.
Haha.

1482
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:26,690
Come out.

1483
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,670
Come on. I'm disappointed. Come out.

1484
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,300
- It's cold outside. Come in.
- Look at us.

1485
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,300
- Oh, hi.
- My goodness.

1486
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,880
- Hello.
- Se Chan.

1487
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,400
- Hello.
- What's with the mustache?

1488
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,650
- Oh, a mustache.
- That's cool.

1489
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,880
Isn't it nice?
I decided to grow a dirty mustache.

1490
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,110
So Min is exhausted
from waiting for you.

1491
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,110
- Come in.
- What's that?

1492
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,420
You look so tired.

1493
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,860
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1494
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,880
So Min. Your boyfriend is here.

1495
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,550
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1496
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,590
- You should've shaved.
- How was it this time?

1497
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,130
Why does your mustache grow
like a goat?

1498
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,740
- You look...
- You look like a goat.

1499
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,940
- You look Japanese.
- Right?

1500
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,110
You look Japanese.

1501
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,440
- You don't look noble.
- You look puffy.

1502
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,300
- Hey.
- So what's happening?

1503
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,050
I have to make you
breakfast tomorrow.

1504
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:13,150
- You?
- Really?

1505
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:17,110
- I have to pick two people.
- What?

1506
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,760
Two people to help me.

1507
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,650
- Gosh. Hey.
- So...

1508
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:24,380
- Because...
- It has to be me.

1509
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,360
- Se Chan.
- All of a sudden, everyone is...

1510
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,860
Se Chan.

1511
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,670
(No one wants to make breakfast
because...)

1512
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,030
(1. They have to get up at 7 a.m.
when everyone is still sleeping.)

1513
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,740
(2. They have to make a fire again.)

1514
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:40,110
If you look tired, I can't help
but choose that person.

1515
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:41,900
I'm fine. If you want to make
rice cake soup,

1516
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,670
we have a tteokbokki
restaurant owner.

1517
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:44,940
Right.

1518
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,610
We have someone
good at making a fire.

1519
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:49,320
- The fire man.
- Personally,

1520
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,860
as a man who was on "Family Outing,"

1521
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,780
you need someone to guide you.

1522
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,420
Jae Suk is a must.

1523
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,360
People with "Family Outing"
experience are...

1524
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,920
- Jong Kook and Jae Suk.
- I need them.

1525
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,960
I need one of them?

1526
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,300
You must pick one of them.

1527
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,800
But if they're too good,
it won't be funny.

1528
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,570
To make it funny,

1529
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,860
- Right. One must be clumsy.
- one must be clumsy.

1530
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,210
Jae Suk, you're right.

1531
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,630
You need to decide that.

1532
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,800
I told you.

1533
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,670
Rice cake soup doesn't need much.

1534
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,010
- Right.
- All I need is the beef bone broth.

1535
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,610
Waking up early in the morning is
the hassle.

1536
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,490
Woo Jae is good
at making egg garnish.

1537
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,490
- You need it for rice cake soup.
- He's...

1538
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,050
- Joo the egg garnish.
- Joo the egg garnish.

1539
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,050
He's very good.

1540
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:31,420
Or is it going to be someone
good at cooking like So Min?

1541
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,090
You all don't want to do it, do you?

1542
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,730
That's not it.

1543
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,920
That's not it. I don't mind.

1544
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,090
How about this? If you suddenly...

1545
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,240
- Three.
- say three,

1546
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,010
three people gather.

1547
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,610
Choose the ones that are left alone.

1548
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:47,840
Or choose between coke and sprite.

1549
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,400
Jae Suk.

1550
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,110
Do you want me to play
"Round and Round?"

1551
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,280
So I can choose it at once?

1552
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,480
If you say four.

1553
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,420
If we play, "Round and Round,"

1554
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,380
- What is that?
- I say three...

1555
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,050
and choose those three?

1556
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,530
How about this?

1557
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,420
Are we really playing this?

1558
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,460
Se Chan is...

1559
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,030
Do you not want to play? Jae Suk...

1560
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,940
What's the rule? Let's be clear.

1561
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,400
Let's dance. You have to dance.

1562
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,210
(A heart dance
instead of "Hype Boy")

1563
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,400
What's going on?

1564
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,650
- What's the rule?
- There shouldn't be too many?

1565
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,010
What's the rule?

1566
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:25,320
I say round and round.

1567
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,780
If I say three,

1568
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,780
the one left alone is
going to make breakfast.

1569
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,780
Here.

1570
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,210
You should stand in the center.

1571
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,920
I'll play
"Wheat and Barley Are Growing."

1572
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,230
(Changing the song
to "Wheat and Barley Are Growing")

1573
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,530
- What's that song?
- Wheat and barley are growing

1574
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:41,030
(The first game to choose
who will make breakfast)

1575
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:42,360
Stand here.

1576
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,960
Start moving.

1577
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,360
(Off the train goes.)

1578
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:53,010
(Who will wake up first
and make rice cake soup?)

1579
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,170
The other way.

1580
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,650
(Making a fuss)

1581
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:07,010
Three.

1582
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,530
(Jae Suk, Haha, and Woo Jae
make a team.)

1583
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,900
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and Suk Jin
make a team.)

1584
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,170
- So Min.
- It's So Min.

1585
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,990
- So Min.
- So Min.

1586
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,090
All right. The first person.

1587
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,860
- So Min.
- It's Jeon So Min.

1588
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,130
Why didn't you come?

1589
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,980
I was going to,
but then Suk Jin stopped me.

1590
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,010
Really?

1591
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,740
Three.

1592
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,840
(Go away.)

1593
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,820
- Good job.
- So, it's So Min.

1594
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,050
- It's her.
- Me?

1595
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,760
- You come in.
- Zombie?

1596
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,820
- Zombie.
- Okay.

1597
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,110
Is it over? No second chance?

1598
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,230
- It's over.
- Is it over like that?

1599
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,690
- You're...
- You're out.

1600
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,300
- There will be one more person.
- Am I out?

1601
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,260
I should put on my gloves.

1602
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,630
He's going to follow the walls.

1603
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,630
- Ten seconds.
- Wait.

1604
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:52,740
Nine.

1605
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,090
Eight.

1606
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:55,630
Seven.

1607
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,740
(Woo Jae is inside the blanket,
and Jae Suk is trying to fly.)

1608
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,840
Six.

1609
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,110
- Five.
- I'm going to hold onto it.

1610
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,170
Four.

1611
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,050
Three.

1612
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,210
Two.

1613
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,420
One.

1614
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,150
Start. I'm going in.

1615
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:14,920
(He chose the worst place
while trying to hold onto a pillar.)

1616
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,880
I'm going in. I can't see anything.

1617
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,570
(The predator look adds tension
to the game.)

1618
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,800
(Nothing but breathtaking silence)

1619
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,400
Where's that?

1620
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,880
(So Min's trying to lure him
towards Haha.)

1621
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,610
I heard a sound.

1622
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,380
(However)

1623
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,490
(I smell a prey here.)

1624
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,320
(The predator follows his instinct
and moves forward.)

1625
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,440
(They're only 30cm apart.)

1626
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,440
(Laughing)

1627
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,380
Wait. I heard something.

1628
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,980
(The predator stopped.)

1629
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,290
(Who's going to be his victim?)

1630
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,150
(Chuckling)

1631
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,230
Got you.

1632
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:34,670
- Jae Suk.
- Okay.

1633
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,420
He couldn't hold back.

1634
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,170
He couldn't hold back his laughter.

1635
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,730
Hey.

1636
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,770
(Jae Suk couldn't help but laugh
at Se Chan's look.)

1637
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,460
- Gosh.
- One more.

1638
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,980
- One more.
- This?

1639
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,980
This.

1640
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,610
The one who is the same as Se Chan.

1641
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,270
- We'll play rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1642
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,710
What are you going to give?

1643
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:51,820
Who do you want it to be?

1644
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,440
- Rock.
- Rock. Okay.

1645
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,090
I'm going to give a rock.

1646
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,050
I'm going to give a rock.
I'm going to go for it.

1647
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,360
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1648
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,590
(Paper, scissors)

1649
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,590
(Woo Jae is out.)

1650
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,150
Seriously.

1651
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:07,960
- He's safe.
- I survived alone.

1652
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,300
- Am I the only one?
- You're safe.

1653
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,540
- One more time.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1654
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,710
(Scissors, rock, paper,
scissors, rock)

1655
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:19,380
- Okay.
- Suk Jin.

1656
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,980
(It's Suk Jin.)

1657
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,840
Suk Jin.

1658
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,150
(Those who are making breakfast)

1659
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,380
- Every time I play this,
- Done.

1660
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,820
- It's over.
- it's always you, me, and Jae Suk.

1661
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,750
- It's strange.
- I know.

1662
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:34,360
You and I washed
the dishes yesterday.

1663
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,790
It's unlucky people again.

1664
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,190
- It's them again.
- It's strange.

1665
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,750
- Why is it always the three of us?
- Tomorrow morning...

1666
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,400
We played games for so long.

1667
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,500
- We've been playing for so long.
- It must be the ghost.

1668
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,460
- It's the ghost.
- Last time we played,

1669
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,130
- it was me and him.
- We had to wash the dishes.

1670
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,360
We all played it together.

1671
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,270
You broke the odds.

1672
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,630
Let's sleep.

1673
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,800
Do you want me
to spread the blankets?

1674
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,380
- Spread them?
- Spread them.

1675
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,770
Anyone need more blankets?

1676
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,880
Give me a big one.

1677
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,480
- A big blanket?
- Yes, a big one.

1678
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,380
- For the floor?
- Jong Kook, do you like this?

1679
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,790
- What?
- Do you like this blanket?

1680
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:06,380
Why do you ask? Do you want it?

1681
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,550
- Yes.
- Take it then.

1682
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,960
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1683
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,360
If you ask...

1684
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,730
if I like it...

1685
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,770
Let me use this blanket.

1686
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,190
The three of you can sleep
on those two.

1687
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:21,070
The three of you sleep on them.
I'll sleep here.

1688
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,460
He wants to sleep comfortably alone.

1689
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,440
I just don't want to bother anyone.

1690
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,880
I move around.

1691
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,000
Suk Jin, I am sorry,

1692
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:30,820
but do you wake up and run around?

1693
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,440
It's not like that. While I sleep...

1694
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:35,590
- Suk Jin.
- Do you wake up and run around?

1695
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,460
I put my face
next to someone's feet and such.

1696
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,610
We are set.

1697
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,630
Jae Suk has the best spot.

1698
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,000
Suk Jin, why do you keep wanting
someone else's thing?

1699
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,800
That's the best spot.

1700
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,000
That means he wants it.

1701
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,770
(Their first night together
comes to an end.)

1702
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,730
(It's the next morning.)

1703
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:57,500
(The current time is 6:55 a.m.
The current temperature is 12°C.)

1704
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,320
(The alarm goes off at 7 a.m.)

1705
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:09,440
(Wriggling)

1706
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,380
(My goodness.)

1707
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,630
Isn't it really cold?

1708
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,900
We need to get the fire going.

1709
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,020
Suk Jin.

1710
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,460
(Suk Jin)

1711
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,460
Suk Jin.

1712
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,110
(Laughing)

1713
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,840
- Right now...
- Do you want to go out?

1714
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,940
Yes.

1715
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,980
For goodness' sake.

1716
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,770
Let's order a delivery.

1717
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,070
Is there a restaurant
that's open at this hour?

1718
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:37,770
So Min, come here.

1719
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,380
My goodness.

1720
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,690
People must be waiting outside.

1721
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,790
You never know.

1722
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:46,610
Gosh.

1723
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:47,980
(Se Chan comes outside.)

1724
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,590
Can't we skip breakfast?

1725
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,900
I see that it's really annoying
to make breakfast.

1726
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,690
- Your shoes are pretty.
- Yes.

1727
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,540
- I bought them here yesterday.
- Really?

1728
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,730
- Did you buy them here?
- Yes.

1729
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,570
- They are pretty.
- Yes.

1730
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,710
(He got the shoes
without the owner's approval.)

1731
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,770
Hold on.

1732
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,210
- We need to build a fire first.
- We need to build a fire first.

1733
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:14,710
(Suk Jin comes to work
with a haggard face.)

1734
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:15,750
Suk Jin.

1735
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,590
Can't we order a delivery?

1736
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,210
Suk Jin.

1737
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,650
Who will deliver food at this hour?

1738
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,980
(This frog got woken up
from hibernation.)

1739
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Everyone is here.

1740
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,170
All the members groaned
in their sleep.

1741
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,130
The air was cold,

1742
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:34,960
so it felt like
our heads were outside.

1743
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,400
Outside.

1744
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,130
Seriously.
I felt like my head was outside.

1745
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,730
It was so cold. And yesterday night,

1746
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,210
- someone kept farting.
- It was Suk Jin.

1747
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:45,750
I couldn't sleep
because the floor kept shaking.

1748
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:48,210
And I don't know who it was,

1749
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:50,420
- but someone dreamed of revenge.
- Who?

1750
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,710
Someone ground his or her teeth.

1751
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:54,250
It was Suk Jin.

1752
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,150
- Someone dreamed of revenge.
- Who was it?

1753
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,750
Where is the torch? Hold on.

1754
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,770
- We need to start this furnace too.
- One furnace is enough.

1755
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,360
- One?
- One furnace is enough.

1756
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,770
One furnace is enough.

1757
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,360
It's cold.

1758
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,670
(Se Chan and So Min
prepare the rice cake for the soup.)

59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,940
- It didn't freeze.
- Really? We need to slice it.

1759
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,610
- Do we need to slice it?
- Yes.

1760
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:14,610
It was made yesterday.

1761
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:16,000
- It's nice.
- We can use it.

1762
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,320
(Adding firewood)

1763
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,940
Suk Jin. For goodness' sake.

1764
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,940
The fire was going. Hold on.

1765
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,860
- Stop it.
- Hold on.

1766
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,710
That's not how you do it.

1767
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:29,230
- Wait until the fire is going.
- Why did it get on my hand?

1768
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,400
Get me a newspaper.

1769
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,750
- We need a newspaper.
- Let's add two balls.

1770
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,770
Is there a newspaper?

1771
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,500
- What?
- A newspaper.

1772
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:38,730
Why do you need a newspaper?

1773
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:40,360
We need it to start a fire.

1774
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,070
You can use a paper towel.

1775
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:44,300
Put some cooking oil on it.

1776
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,170
- Paper towel?
- Yes.

1777
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,570
Hey, a camper says...

1778
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,320
we need to put
some cooking oil on it.

1779
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,920
- We don't need to do that.
- Really?

1780
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,690
- Yes. Suk Jin, give it to me.
- Really?

1781
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:55,690
Is that what you do
when you go camping?

1782
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,960
- The cooking oil froze.
- The cooking oil froze.

1783
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,210
- What's this?
- Just give me the paper towel.

1784
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:01,360
Here you go.

1785
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,750
Roll it up.

1786
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:03,790
For goodness' sake.

1787
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:06,150
(The delicate man
hasn't improved at all in a day.)

1788
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,770
- Suk Jin has never done this.
- Me?

1789
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,940
- Yes.
- I don't enjoy camping.

1790
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,000
(He prefers hotels.)

1791
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,230
I should slice the rice cake.

1792
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,040
(Suk Jin decides to slice
the rice cake instead.)

1793
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,110
Suk Jin.

1794
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,570
Why is it sticking?

1795
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,610
When will you finish slicing
at that rate?

1796
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,610
(Eating)

1797
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:29,650
Why are you eating?

1798
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:30,880
You should eat one.

1799
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:36,380
The rice cake should have hardened.
It's sticking too much.

1800
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,730
If you keep eating...

1801
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,630
It's not like that.
It's sticking too much.

1802
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,360
If you keep eating,
when will we finish...

1803
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,670
Se Chan, bring me a plate.

1804
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:45,840
Do I put it here?

1805
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:48,170
- It's soft.
- You are slicing it wrong.

1806
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:49,500
I can't slice it otherwise
because it's soft.

1807
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:52,630
Hey, the rice cake in tteokguk...

1808
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:54,670
- Speak for yourself.
- The rice cake in tteokguk...

1809
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,840
- That's not how you slice it.
- That's not how you slice it.

1810
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,070
This isn't the joraengi rice cake.

1811
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:01,110
- You are slicing it wrong.
- The knife won't go in.

1812
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,020
I can't do it right
because it's too soft.

1813
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:06,050
The rice cake should have hardened.
It didn't harden at all.

1814
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,790
It's still soft.

1815
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,590
You keep eating.

1816
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,800
Suk Jin, if you keep eating...

1817
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,550
(So Min eats it as well.)

1818
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,730
- Jae Suk, did you start a fire?
- No, I didn't.

1819
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,500
Hurry up.

1820
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,440
- Suk Jin.
- Are you still doing it?

1821
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,540
I am almost done.

1822
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,630
- You are bad at this.
- I am almost done.

1823
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,710
- You were on "Family Outing."
- Give me some paper.

1824
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,710
- Jae Suk, are you still doing it?
- Seriously.

1825
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,980
- Hey, I am almost done.
- Why are you so bad at it?

1826
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,550
- Why didn't you ask for help?
- I am...

1827
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:34,020
- I am a veteran.
- A veteran, my foot.

1828
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,190
- Just you wait.
- You keep burning the newspaper.

1829
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,210
The ashes fly all the way here.

1830
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,820
- Hey, the ashes...
- Suk Jin.

1831
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,860
Just imagine that it's snowing.

1832
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,130
- Hey, the ashes...
- I mean...

1833
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,360
- Hey.
- What do we do with the rice cake?

1834
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,630
- Hey.
- I mean...

1835
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:49,020
This is bad. The ashes are landing
on the rice cake.

1836
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,630
- Close the box.
- For goodness' sake.

1837
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,000
Shouldn't we call over
the fire enthusiast?

1838
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,800
- No.
- He is sleeping.

1839
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,230
He is on his phone.

1840
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,270
Once the fire enthusiast hears this,

1841
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,940
- he will crawl out on his own.
- His ears must be twitching.

1842
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,400
Didn't you do it yesterday?

1843
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,440
Jong Kook did it.

1844
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,920
He is a genius at saving a spark.

1845
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:07,940
(Chuckling)

1846
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,380
He can't stand it when a spark dies.

1847
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:13,550
It was my first time seeing him
so excited about saving something.

1848
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,460
- It's done.
- It's done.

1849
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,920
- We almost woke Jong Kook up.
- It's done.

1850
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,000
We finished slicing the rice cake.

1851
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,670
We don't need to slice more.

1852
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:26,730
Stop.

1853
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,040
- This is enough, right?
- Yes.

1854
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:30,340
Cut a corner.

1855
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,070
(They begin making tteokguk
1 hour after waking up.)

1856
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,210
Pour it in.

1857
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:35,050
(Gushing out)

1858
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,650
Suk Jin, just go into the room.

1859
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:40,380
- Suk Jin, just go into the room.
- I must do this. I promised.

1860
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,550
- I think...
- I promised.

1861
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:43,650
- you had enough screen time.
- No.

1862
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,880
- Just go back to bed.
- Pretend to slip.

1863
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,650
No. Hey, the opening is...

1864
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,920
- too small. The broth is frozen.
- What?

1865
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,650
For goodness' sake.

1866
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:55,090
(The broth doesn't come out well
since it's frozen.)

1867
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,130
Will you eat the back ribs
if I make them?

1868
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,360
- Of course, we will eat them.
- Of course.

1869
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,360
- I wanted to cook them yesterday.
- It's the dish...

1870
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,770
- that contains kimchi.
- Yes.

1871
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:10,070
He said that he is good at making
braised kimchi with back ribs.

1872
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:13,050
Suk Jin, let's grill...

1873
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:15,610
some rice cake for breakfast.

1874
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,980
That's a good idea.

1875
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,380
- Let's grill it on the gridiron.
- Where?

1876
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:19,650
- The gridiron.
- The gridiron.

1877
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,380
What is a gridiron again?

1878
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:27,690
Oh, that's the gridiron.

1879
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,400
- I am sorry. I am not fully awake.
- He is like that in the morning.

1880
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,090
(Gridiron is the cookware
for grilling meat and rice cake.)

1881
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,710
- This is the gridiron.
- Yes.

1882
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:37,730
- I was dazed for a second.
- We need two.

1883
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,040
I dozed off for a second.

1884
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:42,980
Should I pour water in here?

1885
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,070
Shouldn't I do that?

1886
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:46,150
- The broth keeps getting reduced.
- We need to start making tteokguk.

1887
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:48,190
We need to hurry up
before the broth evaporates.

1888
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,750
How long will it take
to make the braised kimchi?

1889
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,020
About an hour.

1890
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,020
- Why did you tell the crew?
- It will take about an hour.

1891
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,650
- Why did you say you will make it?
- I don't know.

1892
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,730
- For goodness' sake.
- Why did you say you will make it?

1893
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:00,650
- Braised kimchi with back ribs...
- An hour with this fire.

1894
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:03,000
It has begun again.

1895
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,300
- This happened yesterday too.
- This is driving me crazy.

1896
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,170
The broth evaporates,
but the other dish isn't done.

1897
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:10,500
We keep going
because the timing is off.

1898
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:12,380
- Se Chan, get some water.
- We need to eat the dish.

1899
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,380
We need to add water
before it evaporates.

1900
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,210
This is driving me crazy.

1901
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,380
This is a repeat of yesterday.

1902
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,550
- For goodness' sake.
- This is bad.

1903
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,820
This is bad. Hold on.
We should take this out.

1904
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:24,860
What do you mean?

1905
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:26,750
- It's boiling too much.
- We should take it out.

1906
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,050
Why did you come up with this idea?

1907
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,650
We can eat the dish once it boils.

1908
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:32,820
- Really?
- Yes.

1909
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:35,170
Once it boils, we just add kimchi
and boil it some more.

1910
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,840
- My goodness.
- The rice cake looks tasty.

1911
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,960
It will be tasty.

1912
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,300
It's too bad
that we don't have honey.

1913
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,500
People inside the room
won't be able to eat it.

1914
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,230
- Tteokguk.
- We will make honey.

1915
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,800
- There is honey.
- Where is it?

1916
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,380
- Is there honey?
- Se Chan, add a bit of soy sauce.

1917
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,650
- Add a bit of soy sauce.
- There is honey.

1918
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:53,170
- Hold on. So Min.
- Yes?

1919
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,750
You don't think you are married...

1920
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,050
- to Se Chan, do you?
- The three of us...

1921
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:57,250
Honey.

1922
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:58,920
Jae Suk, there is grain syrup.

1923
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,960
Honey, bring it over here
with a bit of soy sauce.

1924
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,020
"Honey."

1925
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,290
So Min.

1926
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,400
If you introduce Se Chan
to your family,

1927
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,500
would your parents like it?

1928
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,900
- My mom would love it.
- Would she love it?

1929
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,800
- Of course.
- You just need to decide.

1930
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,460
- Of course.
- Her mom likes Se Chan.

1931
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,980
- You just need to decide.
- Se Chan just needs to decide.

1932
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,670
- Se Chan just needs to decide.
- That's right.

1933
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:21,940
- What?
- Se Chan.

1934
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,880
- I see.
- What?

1935
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,050
- Just ignore what I said.
- Doesn't your mom...

1936
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,750
Doesn't your mom talk about...

1937
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,110
- So Min?
- Everyone else has decided.

1938
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:30,880
Did So Min's parents talk about
my mom?

1939
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,690
- No.
- For goodness' sake.

1940
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,920
- So Min's parents...
- My mom?

1941
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,250
like you as her boyfriend.

1942
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,250
You just need to decide.

1943
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,090
- So Min's parents?
- Yes.

1944
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,460
- Really?
- Let's say...

1945
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,670
you introduce So Min to your parents
as your girlfriend.

1946
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,900
How would they react?

1947
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,500
They would be surprised.

1948
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,940
- Would they be happy?
- They would be happy.

1949
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,540
- What does Se Hyeong say?
- Se Hyeong...

1950
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,070
doesn't talk about such things.

1951
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,570
- He isn't the type to do that.
- No.

1952
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,900
What's up with that smile?

1953
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,670
Is my brother-in-law doing well?

1954
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,880
(The future daughter-in-law
is a bit cheesy.)

1955
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,380
It's getting charred, not grilled.

1956
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,090
Is the fire too strong?

1957
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:08,130
- I won't be able to eat it.
- It looks tasty.

1958
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,790
I won't be able to eat it.
We should grill it on a pan.

1959
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,730
- It looks tasty.
- Let me try it.

1960
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,920
- It's too charred.
- It should be okay inside.

1961
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,500
(Humming in approval)

1962
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,670
It's cooked.

1963
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,270
It's good.

1964
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:22,270
(He said
he won't be able to eat it.)

1965
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:23,300
Try it.

1966
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,980
It's tasty, right?

1967
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,340
- Okay. Now...
- It's boiling.

1968
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:32,150
- It's boiling, Se Chan.
- Once you add the ingredients...

1969
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,250
No. It needs to boil some more.

1970
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:34,980
(The ribs are boiling.)

1971
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,550
- Boil it with kimchi.
- It's cooked.

1972
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:39,610
Once it boils,
I will rinse the ribs with water.

1973
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:41,150
Then I will add kimchi
and braise it.

1974
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,590
- It's coming along nicely.
- We need to discard the water.

1975
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,960
- We need to discard the water.
- Right?

1976
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:46,690
- We can discard it now.
- No.

1977
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:47,900
- Now...
- No.

1978
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,500
- We don't have much time.
- The fire is steady.

1979
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:51,070
It will take an hour now.

1980
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:52,500
We don't have much time, Se Chan.

1981
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,860
- But...
- I can't wait to eat it.

1982
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:57,500
Let's eat breakfast and go home.

1983
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,480
(Suk Jin wants to eat
and go home on time.)

1984
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,300
- The ribs are ready.
- Suk Jin,

1985
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,940
- they aren't ready.
- Look.

1986
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:06,070
- They are still red.
- The impurities came out already.

1987
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:07,270
More impurities need to come out.

1988
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:09,090
- The tasty juice is coming out.
- No.

1989
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:10,840
- Suk Jin.
- All right.

1990
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,250
Hurry up and discard the water.

1991
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,150
(Se Chan discards the water
upon Suk Jin's insistence.)

1992
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:22,130
(He puts kimchi on the top.)

1993
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,320
Let's see how it looks.

1994
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,540
- Is that how you make it?
- Yes.

1995
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:26,930
- Let's see.
- It's almost done now.

1996
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:28,970
To here...

1997
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,210
You should add some water.

1998
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:31,840
No. I will add some broth.

1999
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:34,770
You shouldn't add so much.

2000
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,350
- What?
- You can add everything.

2001
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:37,400
Really?

2002
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:39,350
Se Chan.

2003
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,420
Se Chan, it looks delicious.

2004
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:43,250
Suk Jin, please open the lid.

2005
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,890
Thank you.

2006
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,260
It's boiling.

2007
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,820
(He adds Cheongyang chili...)

2008
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:51,800
(and green onion.)

2009
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,150
- It smells good.
- Yes.

2010
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,970
You know...

2011
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,300
(Lastly, he adds minced garlic
and kimchi juice.)

2012
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,690
It smells like a proper dish.

2013
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:02,560
It's ready. Close the lid now.

2014
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,810
We need to boil it for an hour now.

2015
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,970
- An hour?
- Yes.

2016
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:07,840
(Will it be ready
in an hour from now?)

2017
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,180
- Close the lid.
- Do we need to boil it for an hour?

2018
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,420
Kimchi needs to turn soft.

2019
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,810
If we boil it for an hour...

2020
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:13,810
(The cooking time
continues to lengthen.)

2021
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:16,250
Yesterday, we had
the exact same situation.

2022
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,890
Let me put it here.

2023
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,480
Suk Jin, don't ruin it.

2024
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,020
- I am not ruining it.
- Leave it as it is.

2025
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,930
It's tilted. Take a look.

2026
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,390
It's tilted. It should be level.

2027
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,860
Hold on.

2028
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:34,190
- It's Se Chan's dish.
- I have had a feast for 30 years.

2029
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:35,540
Let Se Chan do it.

2030
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,640
What are you saying?

2031
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,710
- You have had a feast for 30 years?
- You punk.

2032
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:40,930
What?

2033
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:42,140
- What?
- You punk.

2034
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:43,350
- What's that?
- I want to boil the rice.

2035
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:44,350
Do you want to salvage it?

2036
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:46,610
Yes. I will add water and boil it.
We can discard it if it fails.

2037
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:47,810
(So Min brings the leftover rice
from yesterday.)

2038
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,050
You shouldn't do that.

2039
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,350
(The breakfast menu was tteokguk.)

2040
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,010
I think you made a mistake.

2041
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:54,790
- So Min.
- Did you add water?

2042
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:58,220
Wasn't our mission to make tteokguk?

2043
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:00,460
Why are you making braised kimchi...

2044
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:03,020
and rice?
We just needed to eat tteokguk.

2045
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:06,000
Why are you creating more work?

2046
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,170
Seriously.

2047
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,310
Stop opening the lid.

2048
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,570
Do you want to eat?

2049
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,730
I am hungry.

2050
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:15,900
(Suk Jin must be hungry for real.)

2051
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,680
I am hungry.

2052
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,810
This is nice.

2053
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,140
This is nice.

2054
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:21,790
- What?
- This is nice.

2055
01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:23,090
This is...

2056
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:25,260
It's bound to be tasty.

2057
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,510
But it tastes bad.

2058
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:27,790
Try it.

2059
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:29,350
It's strange that it tastes bad.

2060
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:30,590
- It's good.
- Is it tasty?

2061
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:31,890
- It's becoming tasty.
- Let me try it.

2062
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:32,960
- Is it becoming tasty?
- Yes.

2063
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:34,520
This is...

2064
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,170
- It's bound to be tasty.
- Right?

2065
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,840
- It's bound to be a hit.
- It's becoming tasty.

2066
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,140
- It's nice.
- It's so tasty.

2067
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,170
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

2068
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,210
- It's bound to be tasty.
- It looks tasty.

2069
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,970
It's bound to be a success.

2070
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,550
You said it will be a failure.

2071
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,750
- No.
- I didn't mean it like that.

2072
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:53,850
I think he will gnaw on the ribs
like crazy.

2073
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:56,440
- It was salty.
- I said he will only eat the ribs.

2074
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:59,220
It was salty. It became tasty
because we added more water.

2075
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,520
You are supposed to add water
towards the end.

2076
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,460
- Now,
- I make it all the time.

2077
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,760
we can make tteokguk.

2078
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,760
- Let's make it.
- Okay.

2079
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,130
All right. Hold it.

2080
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:10,100
- Hold on.
- Be careful.

2081
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,170
Okay.

2082
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:14,190
My spoons won't go in.

2083
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,560
Take off your gloves first.

2084
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:19,070
- No. It's okay.
- Did you say "spoons" just now?

2085
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:20,900
- I said "fingers."
- You said "spoons" just now.

2086
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,550
- What's wrong with your hearing?
- Suk Jin did this earlier.

2087
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:24,310
- I said "fingers."
- "My feet are cold."

2088
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,380
(He rubbed his hands and said,
"My feet are cold.")

2089
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:28,610
(Suk Jin's body is full of lies.)

2090
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,610
I asked him,
"Do you mean your hands?"

2091
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,850
And he said, "My feet are cold too."

2092
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:34,390
"My feet are cold too."

2093
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,680
Suk Jin is disoriented.

2094
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,430
Suk Jin is disoriented.

2095
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,600
Suk Jin, come on.

2096
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:41,020
Jae Suk, here we go.
One, two, three.

2097
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:43,130
I said "fingers."

2098
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,170
How big is it?

2099
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,060
- We can put it on the top.
- We should be careful.

2100
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,340
- The gloves are fireproof.
- Hold on.

2101
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:50,340
How does it work?

2102
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,470
We can put it on the top.

2103
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,770
How? Like this?

2104
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:55,070
- Come on.
- Yes. You should go over there.

2105
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,050
For goodness' sake.

2106
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:01,380
I told you that they will get stuck.

2107
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,720
(He is clumsy until the end.)

2108
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:06,510
- Shall we add the dumplings?
- Let's add the dumplings.

2109
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:10,320
Do we add all of them?
There are too many, right?

2110
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:11,820
- What?
- There are two bags.

2111
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,460
There are meat dumplings
and kimchi dumplings.

2112
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,100
We need to add minced garlic now.

2113
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,500
Se Chan is good.

2114
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,690
He is good at cooking.

2115
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,560
His cooking skills shine
at a place like this.

2116
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,310
- Do you add the green onion now?
- No, add it at the end.

2117
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:24,810
We add it at the end, right?

2118
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:26,840
We need to add the eggs too.

2119
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,440
- The eggs.
- Yes.

2120
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,850
(It's time to add the eggs.)

2121
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,680
The eggs are frozen.

2122
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,310
The eggs? It's because it's cold.

2123
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:36,510
I know that.

2124
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,850
Why wouldn't I know that?

2125
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:39,960
Why wouldn't I know that?

2126
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:44,430
We should add green onion
to the eggs.

2127
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,820
Why are you adding green onion?

2128
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,670
- What?
- Why are you adding green onion?

2129
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,890
This is how you do it.

2130
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:57,100
- No, you add it separately.
- No, it's tasty this way.

2131
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:58,930
Haven't you made it this way?

2132
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,210
Why did you...

2133
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:01,510
Are you making scrambled eggs?

2134
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:04,400
- No.
- Don't you add it separately?

2135
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,220
- No, this is how you do it.
- Suk Jin.

2136
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:07,720
- This is a way to do it.
- Green onion...

2137
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,920
It's a cultural difference.

2138
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,090
Can't you try it this way?

2139
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:13,650
- What kind of culture is this?
- My family makes it this way.

2140
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,960
If we do something like this again,

2141
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,430
you shouldn't come.

2142
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,460
It will be tasty.

2143
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,500
- I can't believe you guys.
- So Min,

2144
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,800
we should pull them apart.

2145
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,890
- What?
- The rice cake slices.

2146
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:26,190
The rice cake didn't harden.

2147
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,760
It looks tasty.

2148
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,900
- See?
- Why did you add green onion?

2149
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:33,210
It will be tasty. Try it.

2150
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:34,400
I don't see it.

2151
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:36,850
Now...

2152
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:40,770
See? The green onion got separated.
You guys don't know how to cook.

2153
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,850
I bet it tastes amazing.

2154
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:45,890
Is it tasty?

2155
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,760
Is it tasty?

2156
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,090
Boil it some more.

2157
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:51,090
- It's good.
- It's tasty.

2158
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:52,930
Once we add pepper, it will be over.

2159
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,520
It's done. It's time to scoop it
into the bowls.

2160
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,860
It's time to wake everyone up.

2161
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,340
Shall I tell them to come out?

2162
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,840
- Yes.
- Tell them to get up.

2163
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:05,880
- Here you go.
- It smells delicious.

2164
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,710
Jong Kook, come on out.

2165
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,510
It looks delicious.

2166
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,470
It looks amazing.

2167
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:15,180
(They made
the right amount of tteokguk.)

2168
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,180
It looks great.

2169
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:19,610
- Guys?
- Yes?

2170
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,220
Guys, what are you doing?

2171
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:23,820
Is the breakfast ready?

2172
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,220
Wake up. What time is it?

2173
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:29,360
- It's cold.
- We were waiting.

2174
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,470
Wake up and come on out.

2175
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,230
Let's go.

2176
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,310
It's cold, right?

2177
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:37,600
- It's cold.
- The weather is insane outside.

2178
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,140
It's too cold.

2179
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,310
Don't you want to eat here?

2180
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:42,940
We should eat outside.

2181
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,640
How was it done in "Family Outing?"

2182
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,880
We ate outside.

2183
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:47,570
Did you eat outside?

2184
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:48,590
(The delicate man
doesn't understand.)

2185
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:49,940
I don't understand.

2186
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:51,920
It smells delicious.

2187
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:54,760
Jong Kook, come on out.

2188
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:57,430
It looks delicious.

2189
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,670
It looks great.

2190
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:03,720
(Her hair is a mess.)

2191
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:06,760
Did you set the table?

2192
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,760
(They wake up one at a time
looking like they were just born.)

2193
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,360
- It's so cold.
- Hey.

2194
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:13,270
All right.

2195
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,270
(Looking around)

2196
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:17,510
When you have a place like this,
it wouldn't be hard...

2197
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:21,420
to set up a pull-up bar.

2198
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:23,790
- Hey.
- I always wonder about that.

2199
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:26,610
You just need a screwdriver
to set up a pull-up bar.

2200
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,150
Who...

2201
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,560
(Sighing)

2202
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,150
would use a pull-up bar?

2203
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,560
I would love to hang from it.

2204
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,720
(He is going through a withdrawal
since he hasn't worked out.)

2205
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,190
I would love to work out my muscles.

2206
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,730
Hurry up and come on out.

2207
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,900
Woo Jae.

2208
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:45,710
(He hears his name
as soon as he wakes up.)

2209
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:46,880
Haha.

2210
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:50,770
(Other members wake up
one at a time.)

2211
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:52,010
Come on out, Haha.

2212
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:53,270
- Okay.
- It's cold, right?

2213
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,110
I will scoop out the dumplings.

2214
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,480
Go ahead.

2215
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,420
The food came out tasty.

2216
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:04,560
(The tteokguk with dumplings
looks delicious.)

2217
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,800
Here you go.

2218
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:07,320
Thank you.

2219
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:09,970
We made tteokguk in the end.

2220
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,860
(He gives a bowl each.)

2221
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,670
- Here you go.
- Come here and eat.

2222
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,400
- Here you go.
- How many bowls did you prepare?

2223
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,600
- The bowls...
- Woo Jae.

2224
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,510
(Ji Hyo woke up
with disheveled hair.)

2225
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:29,140
(Braised kimchi with back ribs
is almost ready.)

2226
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:31,790
- What's this?
- Come on over.

2227
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,650
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat and go back inside.

2228
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:36,650
I did my best,
so I hope the food tastes good.

2229
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,800
I can't believe him.

2230
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,220
- Did he prepare it alone?
- He is so annoying.

2231
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:42,260
What's up with him?

2232
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,000
- He is so annoying, Se Chan.
- Did you do all the work?

2233
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,800
- I did my best.
- He is the hero.

2234
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,970
- Suk Jin.
- He is ridiculous.

2235
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,510
Suk Jin is the hero
behind the breakfast.

2236
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:49,640
What kind of a comment was that?

2237
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,760
Seriously.

2238
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:52,380
- Seriously.
- "I did my best?"

2239
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,470
So Min and Se Chan did all the work.

2240
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,770
He said it so generously too.

2241
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,640
The wall.

2242
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:00,250
My head felt like it was outside.

2243
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,890
Since Se Chan joined,

2244
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:04,180
the food improved so much.

2245
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,460
Let's eat.

2246
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,560
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

2247
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,760
Hurry up and eat.

2248
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,460
(Tteokguk warms up their stomachs
after the cold night.)

2249
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:12,500
Isn't it tasty?

2250
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:14,960
- Let's see.
- It's tasty.

2251
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,300
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

2252
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,640
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty, right?

2253
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:21,600
Hey, this is so good.

2254
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:23,760
- It's so delicious.
- This is nice.

2255
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:25,470
It's really good.

2256
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,510
The rice cake is so chewy.

2257
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:29,210
(Amazed)

2258
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,400
- You did well.
- It's delicious.

2259
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:33,920
This is tasty.

2260
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,610
- It's really good.
- I know.

2261
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:37,440
This is top-class. I mean the taste.

2262
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:41,260
I should eat it right away.

2263
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,890
(Gobbling up)

2264
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,560
It feels like we just got here.

2265
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,390
How time flies.

2266
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,820
The kimchi dumpling is good.

2267
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,760
- Everything is good.
- I really like it.

2268
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,360
I should eat some dumplings.

2269
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,190
The kimchi dumpling is good.

2270
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,840
After eating rice cake
and dumplings,

2271
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,810
I'll stop by the gym on my way home.

2272
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:02,270
You'll stop by the gym?

2273
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:04,380
That's my plan.
I'll eat some rice cake.

2274
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:06,810
Rice cake makes me stronger.

2275
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:08,750
- Rice cake is carbohydrate.
- Right.

2276
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:09,890
This is good.

2277
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:11,290
- The meat tastes good too.
- Right.

2278
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:12,810
Try the meat. It's tasty.

2279
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:17,680
(It's nice to hear Woo Jae eat something
after a long time.)

2280
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:20,930
- Jae Suk is good at it.
- Right.

2281
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,690
(Yoom)

2282
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:25,190
I should sleep shivering with cold
more often.

2283
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,640
- Why?
- It gives me an appetite.

2284
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,710
- Really?
- Good for you.

2285
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:32,310
I shivered like this while sleeping.
It feels like I exercised.

2286
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,380
Right.

2287
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,600
By the way...

2288
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,920
It's good to be home.

2289
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,270
There's no place like home.

2290
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:44,350
He says that to finish the shoot.

2291
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,960
- Suk Jin, do you have plans?
- No.

2292
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,520
- I saw him make an appointment.
- What's the rush?

2293
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,000
"Hey, I think
I'll be there by lunchtime."

2294
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:53,820
He made an appointment.

2295
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:55,130
- It's not like that.
- "Sure."

2296
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:57,390
"Yes. I think I'll be back
by lunchtime."

2297
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:58,860
Hey, that's not true.

2298
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,860
They suddenly wanted to cook
braised kimchi with back ribs,

2299
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:01,860
so I blamed them.

2300
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:04,140
"Tteokguk is enough for breakfast."

2301
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:06,380
"Why do you want to cook
braised kimchi with back ribs?"

2302
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,810
When we got here yesterday,
I was like...

2303
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:12,680
"How are we going to spend
a whole day here?"

2304
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,220
- But time passed quickly.
- Time flew.

2305
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:16,440
I feel like I just got here.

2306
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,140
Doesn't it feel like
we just got here?

2307
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:20,110
Time goes so fast.

2308
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:21,610
- Why are you wrapping things up?
- That's fake.

2309
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,930
Why are you saying things
to wrap up the shoot?

2310
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:26,430
You know
the value of labor is priceless.

2311
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:28,820
That's because we kept
doing things without a break.

2312
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:30,600
- It's because of busy work.
- So we weren't bored.

2313
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,800
- We never stayed still.
- Exactly.

2314
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,860
So we're spinning the wheel.

2315
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,100
All right.

2316
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,880
It's been 24 hours
since we got here yesterday.

2317
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,880
Yes.

2318
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:41,710
What is this from last night?

2319
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:44,210
Last night,
those people were chosen...

2320
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:47,110
- by the audio team.
- What did they do?

2321
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:48,470
(Haha was wearing the mic
through the night.)

2322
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:51,290
(Woo Jae made a good sound
cooking the meat.)

2323
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:53,420
(Haha giggled a lot
and made others laugh.)

2324
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:56,480
(Jae Suk played some music
that's good for the New Year.)

2325
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:00,130
Including the 2 slots for the rest,
we have 6 slots left.

2326
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:03,760
You can put the names
you want on them.

2327
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,140
- Over here?
- Yes. You can decide.

2328
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,930
I have only one name, so pick me.

2329
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,730
- I need one too.
- How many? Two, four...

2330
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,210
All right then. What about this?

2331
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:13,770
Hang on.

2332
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:16,010
Except these two,

2333
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:19,470
we have slots from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. here.

2334
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:21,270
We should choose four people
who worked hard.

2335
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,010
- Gosh.
- Come on, Suk Jin.

2336
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,680
- That's not right.
- Why not? What do you want?

2337
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,090
We should take a vote as well.

2338
01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:30,290
- Among the members?
- Among the members.

2339
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:31,520
What do you think
it should be about?

2340
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,930
Those who ate a lot of dumplings.

2341
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:34,650
Eating a lot of dumplings?

2342
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:37,000
- Just say what you want.
- Those who enjoyed the breakfast.

2343
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,860
Or the one who worked hardest
to cut the rice cake.

2344
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:41,500
What about the one
who brought rice cake?

2345
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,900
I don't think it has to be
about the morning.

2346
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:46,010
It can be something
about last night.

2347
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:47,570
The one who slept well.

2348
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,600
- She's talking about herself.
- That's you.

2349
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,010
- You're the one who slept well.
- It's you.

2350
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,810
Your face shows that
you had a good night's sleep.

2351
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,940
- I recommend Suk Jin.
- Why?

2352
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:57,510
Because he woke up looking healthy.

2353
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:58,680
Thank you.

2354
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,090
- I'm so grateful.
- When I woke him up this morning,

2355
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:01,480
he didn't get up,
so I was really worried.

2356
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:02,820
Thank you so much.

2357
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,630
- Palm face down or up
- Who shows the different one.

2358
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:06,460
It's Ji Hyo.

2359
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,460
(Jong Kook enjoyed tteokguk,
Suk Jin woke up well.)

2360
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,630
(Se Chan prepared breakfast.)

2361
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,630
(Ji Hyo slept well in the cold.
So Min is cute.)

2362
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:13,100
(Ji Hyo won the game.)

2363
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:15,140
We just put up Ji Hyo's name.

2364
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,900
- It's her again.
- Ji Hyo is amazing.

2365
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:20,010
Now we will choose the members
to win the prize.

2366
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:23,310
The prize is a piece of gold rabbit.

2367
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,720
- It's cute.
- This is nice.

2368
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:27,850
The same name can be picked again.

2369
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,590
You will spin the wheel three times.

2370
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:30,890
Okay.

2371
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:32,150
I'll try spinning it.

2372
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:33,150
All right.

2373
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:35,890
Now, President Ji will spin it.

2374
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:38,130
- I'll spin it.
- President Ji will do it.

2375
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:39,960
- Haha, we will give a slap.
- If you complain, you get a slap.

2376
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,500
If you complain, you'll get slapped.

2377
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,100
- I'm serious.
- You'll get slapped in the face.

2378
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,100
I'll spin it.

2379
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:47,040
You spun it well. It looks good.

2380
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,360
(The first wheel of fortune
is spinning.)

2381
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,010
(Who will be lucky in the New Year
with the gold rabbit?)

2382
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,730
- It's here.
- It's going well.

2383
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:57,350
- It's coming to my name.
- Again.

2384
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:00,420
- Again.
- Again.

2385
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:04,110
(It narrowly escaped So Min's name.)

2386
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:05,510
Spin it again.

2387
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:06,510
(Spinning the wheel again)

2388
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:08,090
President Ji, gosh.

2389
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,680
- This is so thrilling.
- He's good at spinning.

2390
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:13,690
I really hate it
when someone else wins the prize.

2391
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:16,000
This is just about the gold.

2392
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,020
(Whose name is
the arrow pointing to?)

2393
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:21,260
(Is it Jae Suk, Haha, or Ji Hyo?)

2394
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,840
- It's me.
- Gosh.

2395
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,760
It must be me.

2396
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:26,770
Gosh, it's Woo Jae.

2397
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:28,880
(Joo Cinderella wins.)

2398
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:31,050
- Congratulations.
- Okay.

2399
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:32,510
I'll just say one thing.
I accept it.

2400
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:34,310
(The whole time
flashes before his eyes.)

2401
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:36,420
Woo Jae, how many times
do I have to tell you that?

2402
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:39,760
(He had to hear them
call his name the whole time.)

2403
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,520
(Woo Jae continued the tradition
of hard-working Long Legs.)

2404
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,630
- It's Woo Jae.
- Me?

2405
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:48,100
- Just take it.
- Can we spin it again?

2406
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:49,560
- Woo Jae wins.
- Let's spin it again.

2407
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,690
- Woo Jae, it's for you.
- This is the second.

2408
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:53,730
- Gosh, Woo Jae.
- All right.

2409
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:55,300
(The 2nd wheel)

2410
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,260
- I just want one.
- Just once.

2411
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:02,040
(Who's the second member
to win the gold rabbit?)

2412
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,470
Jae Suk has his name
on three spots.

2413
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:06,570
I'm so unlucky.

2414
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:09,510
(Is the wheel stopping?)

2415
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:10,680
(Is it Jae Suk who got 3 slots?)

2416
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,750
One more.

2417
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:15,390
(Is it So Min who's so unlucky
when it comes to prizes?)

2418
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:19,390
(Jeon So Min wins.)

2419
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,800
Congratulations, So Min.

2420
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,020
Cross!

2421
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,670
- Thank you.
- Give me a slap and do it again.

2422
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:27,470
We can do this again
if I get slapped in the face.

2423
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:28,900
- What?
- Let's do it again.

2424
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,010
What did you say?

2425
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:32,510
- If you slap me, we do it again.
- Go ahead and spin it.

2426
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,270
- This is the last one.
- The last one.

2427
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,510
- Please.
- Who's the winner?

2428
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:39,250
Please.

2429
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,970
- I really want to get the gold.
- Just this once.

2430
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,020
- Just this once.
- I have my name on three spots.

2431
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,450
- I want the gold.
- Please.

2432
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:55,120
Gosh.

2433
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,730
- Jeon.
- Let's do it again.

2434
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:57,830
It's Jeon.

2435
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,530
- This is cute.
- Gosh.

2436
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:02,400
(Surprised)

2437
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:04,490
- Darn it.
- This doesn't count.

2438
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:05,590
Is she getting one more?

2439
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:07,570
Thank you so much!

2440
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:10,370
Thank you, everyone. Happy New Year!

2441
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:11,810
- Yes!
- Thank you.

2442
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:13,840
Happy New Year. Thank you.

2443
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,710
I want to get slapped.
I want to spin it again.

2444
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:18,410
Woo Jae. My gosh.

2445
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:20,820
- The year 1986, cross!
- Cross!

2446
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,210
- But this is...
- She can't win twice.

2447
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:23,520
That doesn't make sense.

2448
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,160
Hyung In says it counts.

2449
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,280
Even if she said so,
we can refuse it.

2450
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,530
Let's go home.

2451
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:30,660
So the 24 hours are over.

2452
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,090
Should we ask the guest
how he's feeling?

2453
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:34,400
I bet he liked it.

2454
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,900
- Woo Jae.
- He's not a guest. He's our family.

2455
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:39,630
Me? I don't have
anything special to say.

2456
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:41,030
- All right then.
- What?

2457
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:42,910
Don't say anything.

2458
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:44,200
- All right.
- I was...

2459
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,110
- going to say something now.
- You don't have to.

2460
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:49,650
You don't have to force yourself
to say something.

2461
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:51,840
- But I...
- You should learn from us.

2462
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,950
Right.

2463
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:56,820
Anyway, I was comfortable as always.

2464
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,160
Thanks to everyone...

2465
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,620
That's a cliche.

2466
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,280
- You should've stopped talking.
- Right.

2467
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,330
This is enough.

2468
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:05,830
- He's just...
- Just take the rabbit with you.

2469
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:07,770
All right then.
This is the Year of the Black Rabbit.

2470
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:09,900
Let's give our viewers
greetings for the New Year.

2471
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,290
- Say Happy New Year.
- Should we make a deep bow?

2472
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:13,410
All right.

2473
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,410
- Then...
- Will you bow here?

2474
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:18,280
He's saying that
because he's on a good spot.

2475
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:19,740
It's covered with snow here.

2476
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:21,040
I'll take a step forward and do it.

2477
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,370
Suk Jin,
he should bow to the fiery pit.

2478
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:24,870
- Look.
- You're so mean.

2479
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:26,710
- To the fireplace.
- He might burn his cap.

2480
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:28,650
- Right in front of him...
- Hey.

2481
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:31,750
- He doesn't have anything here.
- We should express our gratitude.

2482
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:32,750
- But...
- Just do it.

2483
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:34,580
The fireplace is
right in front of him.

2484
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:37,230
But we wouldn't be on Running Man
if it weren't for our viewers.

2485
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:38,860
Let's go over here
and make a deep bow then.

2486
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:39,920
All right.

2487
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,030
This looks nice.

2488
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,200
Let's do it there.

2489
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,570
Just find a spot
that's good for you.

2490
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:46,310
- Can I be anywhere I want?
- Whatever you want.

2491
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:47,630
Whatever works for you.

2492
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,830
- Find a place that works for you.
- All right.

2493
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:52,110
- Like this?
- Yes.

2494
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:54,410
- What about this?
- Find something that works for you.

2495
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:57,910
(They all choose spots
that are sunny and clean.)

2496
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:59,170
Get ready.

2497
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:00,880
- I'll do it here.
- Okay.

2498
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,040
This is nice.

2499
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,020
I'm okay
because I'm wearing a long jacket.

2500
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,190
- All right.
- My gosh.

2501
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:09,030
Suk Jin, don't try
to give a lick and a promise.

2502
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,490
You should do it right.

2503
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:12,290
- Why are you doing this?
- You were going to do this.

2504
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:13,900
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

2505
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,990
I can make a deep bow like this.

2506
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,570
- Gosh.
- I like it here.

2507
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,160
- I'm ready now.
- All right.

2508
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:22,940
It's the year 2023,
Year of the Black Rabbit.

2509
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,630
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

2510
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:28,150
(Running Man will keep on running
with big laughter in the year 2023.)

2511
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:29,910
(People fight in life.)

2512
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:32,210
(Fight for energy)

2513
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,120
(Fight for food)

2514
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,120
(Fight for love)

2515
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,990
(For this slack and loose fight,)

2516
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:40,990
(real fighters are here!)

2517
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:42,380
(Choo Sung Hoon, Kim Dong Hyun)

2518
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:43,990
(Jung Chan Sung, Choi Doo Ho)

2519
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,370
(Overwhelming destructive power)

2520
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,420
(With the beasts
who got out of their cages,)

2521
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:51,440
(two trainers want
to play a big game.)

2522
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:54,030
(The top fighters' salary is...)

2523
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:55,330
(five dollars?)

2524
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:57,480
(That's too little!)

2525
01:27:57,870 --> 01:27:59,610
(He boasts
about his dodging skills.)

2526
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,950
(Hitting him in the head)

2527
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:02,910
(But their values are dropping.)

2528
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,150
I injured my leg.

2529
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:05,950
I'll show you my thong.

2530
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:07,150
What?

2531
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:08,240
Why would we see your thong?

2532
01:28:08,410 --> 01:28:10,910
(And the real fight
of the fighters begin.)

2533
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:13,280
(It's a food chain where you get eaten up
when you're off guard.)

2534
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,420
(The winner will take the throne!)

2535
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:17,400
(Salary Fighter)
