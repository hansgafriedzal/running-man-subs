1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,200
(January 2, 2023,
the first shoot in the New Year)

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,570
(At 6:56 a.m.,
near Nodeul Island at Han River)

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,840
Thank you.

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,540
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,370
Happy New Year.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,440
(He gives the production staff
greetings for the New Year.)

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,270
Thanks to you,
we came to work early today.

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,910
It's not because of me. It's just...

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,270
(The reason
they came to work at 7 a.m. is...)

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,520
(The mission
from the Christmas Special)

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,160
(The first shoot of 2023
will be moved up by 10 minutes.)

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,180
So we thought it would be good
to see the sunrise together.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,180
- What?
- The sunrise?

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,000
(They joked about the sunrise,
but it's finally happening.)

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,670
- Hey, Se Chan.
- Hello.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,330
Happy New Year.

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,330
All right.

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,710
Happy New Year to you too.

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,360
Suk Jin, hurry up.

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,330
- What?
- Just hurry and come here.

21
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,330
- Hello.
- Happy New Year.

22
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,380
Thank you.

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,900
(Everyone is coming on time.)

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,180
- Gosh.
- This is nice.

25
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,680
It's nice to be out...

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,210
- when it's dark.
- That's fake. It's not nice.

27
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,210
It's too early in the morning.

28
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,630
He was sleeping until 6:30 a.m.

29
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,800
I woke up at 6:30 a.m.

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,300
- You can barely open your eyes.
- Right.

31
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,720
By the way, I didn't know
we could see the sunrise here.

32
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,830
- All right.
- Let's go.

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,830
Let's go.

34
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,600
We should've gone straight to
the filming spot. Why are we here?

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,180
Maybe to park the cars here.

36
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,770
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,240
We could've gathered here.

38
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,910
Just stop complaining.

39
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,050
- Hi.
- Hello.

40
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,220
- Hi.
- Happy New Year.

41
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,220
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

42
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,140
- Happy New Year.
- Hi. Happy New Year.

43
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,190
- There are benches.
- Hey.

44
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,190
- We should sit here...
- This is cool.

45
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,190
and watch the sunrise.

46
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,430
- Happy New Year!
- My gosh.

47
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,720
The cameras are all set.

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,990
- Happy New Year!
- My gosh.

49
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,300
- The cameras are all set.
- You know what?

50
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,940
- He just grumbled a lot in the car.
- About Suk Jin...

51
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,330
In the car, he was like...

52
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,330
"Hey, why did we come
all the way here?"

53
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,970
- "We could've gathered here."
- "Why did we gather there?"

54
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,240
And now he's like, "Happy New Year!"

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,680
- That's fake.
- Ji Suk Jin's...

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,190
- fake life.
- I wish you all the best.

57
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,630
Gosh, this place is really nice.

58
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,190
Seriously, this spot is perfect
for a special occasion.

59
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,900
- This is nice.
- Go sit. It feels different.

60
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,160
It feels different when you're seated.
You should see it.

61
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,540
- Gosh, Jong Kook.
- Try sitting down.

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,730
Have a seat and look at it.

63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,630
Aren't I right?

64
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,340
Se Chan, imagine you're
sitting here with your girlfriend.

65
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,600
This is crazy.

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Hey, So Bal.

67
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,250
- Hurry and come here.
- Happy New Year.

68
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,310
Hi.

69
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,820
- Happy New Year.
- All right.

70
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,250
- Jeon So Bal
- Hey.

71
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,510
- Jeon So Bal
- Hey, stop it.

72
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,160
Jeon So Bal

73
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,120
- Happy New Year.
- So Bal.

74
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,750
That's funny.

75
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,420
So Min, the bench is an event spot.

76
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,320
- It's like New York.
- There was...

77
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,070
a couple kissing earlier.

78
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,070
- Really?
- I'm serious.

79
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,130
- Is that true?
- In the morning?

80
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,160
Morning kiss.

81
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
- That's amazing.
- Se Chan.

82
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,700
Se Chan, you should go
sit there with So Min.

83
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,970
- You tried it.
- Didn't you see it?

84
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,070
It feels different
when you're seated.

85
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,170
- Try sitting there.
- Did you not watch MBC?

86
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,070
- The golden time is over.
- We should try harder.

87
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,250
We have to work harder.
We should at least kiss.

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,040
- We need some noise marketing.
- Hey.

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,010
Hang on.

90
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,620
(Running hurriedly)

91
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,820
Watch the sunrise.

92
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,450
- This looks really nice.
- It looks pretty.

93
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,290
- It's so pretty.
- This is amazing.

94
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,820
This is what I need
in front of my house.

95
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,840
(Working hard)

96
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,970
- Look at the photos.
- My goodness.

97
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,730
Send them to me.

98
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,540
- This looks great.
- My gosh.

99
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,470
Guys, it's done.
This will make the main piece.

100
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,910
We got it. This is it.

101
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,600
- Hey.
- We should update it.

102
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,410
I think So Min is serious.
Her feelings are growing.

103
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,410
- Seriously...
- They are growing.

104
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,410
Why isn't Ji Hyo here yet?

105
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,720
Ji Hyo is wandering around here.

106
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,350
- Is she lost?
- So she won't...

107
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,920
- watch the sunrise.
- Is it just us?

108
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,420
- She will miss the sunrise.
- This is just real.

109
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,130
- It's funny she got lost.
- She took the wrong way.

110
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,790
- This can be confusing.
- She's here.

111
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,230
- Ji Hyo.
- You're here.

112
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,540
I'm glad that you made it on time.

113
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,630
What took you...

114
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,470
- It's all right.
- She's holding the microphone.

115
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,340
- It's okay.
- I'm really sorry.

116
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,040
- It's no problem.
- Are you a correspondent or what?

117
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,600
- We know.
- We understand.

118
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,170
- You took the wrong way.
- Seriously...

119
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,220
- I was right over there.
- Okay.

120
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,970
- We know.
- Reporter Song Ji Hyo.

121
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,810
- We went back and forth.
- Reporter Song Ji Hyo.

122
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,110
- Seriously, it was really...
- Why are you late?

123
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,410
- Hey.
- You're at the scene...

124
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,720
- so early in the morning.
- I feel like crying.

125
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,530
- Yes.
- It's no problem.

126
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,700
- Don't put it on your jacket.
- Why are you wearing it like that?

127
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,030
- Wear it underneath.
- Don't do that.

128
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,970
Don't pay attention to me.

129
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,100
- I'm so sorry.
- Reporter Song Ji Hyo.

130
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,560
- Don't cry.
- It's okay.

131
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,140
- We know.
- Right.

132
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,800
It was really funny.
The very scene was hilarious.

133
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,600
Thank you, Reporter Song Ji Hyo.

134
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,710
Anyway, Ji Hyo, the sun...

135
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,280
- is not up yet.
- It's not up yet.

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,610
Isn't the sun up already?

137
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,240
No. You'll see the round sun.

138
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,590
Gosh, it's really cold.

139
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,310
Hey, get over it.

140
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,720
Why isn't the sun coming up?

141
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,160
Get over it. If you feel cold,

142
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,620
- that means you lose.
- I heard today would be cold.

143
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,790
It's getting brighter.

144
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,830
There it is.

145
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,700
- It's not up yet.
- That's not it.

146
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,920
You just want to say that and leave.

147
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,700
- No.
- Do some computer graphic work.

148
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,910
- Right?
- We need the CG work instead.

149
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,910
(Amazed)

150
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,280
It's not up yet.

151
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,870
You just want to leave.
But it's not up yet.

152
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,510
(Maenggu tries to spread fake news.)

153
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,650
Hey, my ears are cold.

154
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,310
It's coming up.

155
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,720
- It's coming up.
- It's up.

156
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,350
- There it is.
- It's coming up.

157
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,160
- It's really coming up.
- My gosh.

158
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
I've never watched the sunrise...

159
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,760
- at Han River before.
- This is my first time.

160
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,720
- It's coming up. I can see it.
- Why didn't we try this sooner?

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,490
It's getting bigger.

162
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,700
- Hey, look.
- My goodness.

163
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,770
- Gosh.
- Look at that.

164
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,470
- It's really fast.
- It's so bright.

165
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,230
- My gosh.
- This is amazing.

166
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,640
- It's coming up really fast.
- I know.

167
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,080
I didn't know it was so quick.

168
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,170
- Gosh.
- It's dazzling.

169
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,100
The sunrise is unbelievable.

170
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,950
- This is so nice.
- It feels so good.

171
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,780
- It's like a gem.
- Look at the sun.

172
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,110
- It looks like a gem.
- This is great.

173
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,090
I have to take a picture of this.

174
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,790
- It won't look as good as this.
- Take it and share it with us.

175
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,160
It's coming up really fast.

176
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,470
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

177
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,790
Stay healthy.

178
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,840
- Be happy and stay healthy.
- Be happy and stay healthy.

179
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,010
- Stay healthy.
- Happy New Year.

180
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,230
- Be rich.
- Everyone.

181
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,780
- Be rich.
- Be wealthy.

182
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,210
- Hey, it's a backlit photo.
- It's done.

183
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,710
- No, it looks good.
- Jong Kook, come closer.

184
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,870
One, two, three.

185
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,520
- Okay.
- It's nice.

186
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,850
Jae Suk has changed a lot.
He wants to take selfies now.

187
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,180
I have to take it.

188
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,460
What is this? Five minutes?

189
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,310
What?

190
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,590
- It's a countdown. Five minutes.
- What?

191
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,960
(The countdown suddenly starts.)

192
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,290
- What?
- What is it?

193
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,660
(The production staff
is being silent.)

194
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,720
Tell us.

195
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,490
- What?
- What's that?

196
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,470
- What is it?
- What's going on?

197
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,970
- My goodness.
- What are you doing?

198
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,000
(Out of control)

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,440
(A group of men in suits
is coming at them.)

200
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,110
What is it? What's that?

201
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,290
- Darn it.
- My gosh.

202
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,090
- Hey, what's going on?
- Kim Dong Hyun!

203
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,720
(Martial artist, Kim Dong Hyun)

204
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,050
Hey. Stop it.

205
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,180
Look who's here.

206
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,160
- Isn't he Dong Hyun?
- It's Dong Hyun.

207
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,230
(Martial artist, Choo Sung Hoon)

208
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,420
Who are you?

209
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,490
Aren't you Choo Sung Hoon?

210
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,560
My goodness. Hello.

211
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,910
Why are you doing this? My gosh.

212
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,130
- Come here.
- Wait.

213
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,300
Mr. Jung Chan Sung. I'm a big fan.

214
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,540
I'm a big fan.
Why are you doing this?

215
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,870
What's going on?

216
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,150
What are you doing here? My gosh.

217
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,740
- What is going on?
- Gosh.

218
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,610
- What was that?
- I was really startled.

219
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,660
I thought they were thugs.

220
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,480
- Why are you being like this?
- Just get it over with.

221
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,960
(The thugs are here
to finish things.)

222
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,590
We can end it together.

223
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,050
Hang on.

224
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,900
(The muscular men work together
to deal with Little Ha.)

225
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,270
Are we done?

226
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,990
(Giggling)

227
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,270
What?

228
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,410
(A loach with strong viability)

229
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,370
- I was really surprised.
- Where's Jae Suk?

230
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,840
- I think he ran away.
- Did he run away?

231
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,650
- He's such a coward.
- Where did he go?

232
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,650
- Jae Suk is a coward.
- He's up there.

233
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,040
- Dong Hyun, Jae Suk is up there.
- You didn't rip off his name tag.

234
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,380
You should go get him.

235
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,980
- Chan Sung.
- Behind the car.

236
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,350
(He's coming to catch the loach.)

237
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,680
Behind the car. You should run.

238
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,980
- He's up there.
- Go.

239
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,660
The pure fighters are here.

240
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,530
(Will Jae Suk be able to survive
for the next 50 seconds?)

241
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,670
I'll go left.

242
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,600
You go right.

243
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,400
- Look at Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk is...

244
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,410
- Hey.
- My goodness.

245
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,870
(Startled)

246
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,400
- Look at Jae Suk.
- He's caught.

247
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,640
What's going on?

248
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,850
- What was that?
- He's such a coward.

249
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,510
You all are surprised, right?

250
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,880
Today's guests are
the four pure fighters,

251
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,960
Choo Sung Hoon, Kim Dong Hyun,
Jung Chan Sung, and Choi Doo Ho.

252
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,430
(Jung Chan Sung, Choo Sung Hoon,
Kim Dong Hyun, Choi Doo Ho)

253
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,490
(Korea's first martial artist
who won the UFC title match)

254
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,570
(Korean Zombie, Jung Chan Sung)

255
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,710
(A martial artist who used to be
the national judo athlete)

256
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,230
(The 48-year-old living legend)

257
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,110
(Sa Rang's dad, Choo Sung Hoon)

258
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,910
(The first Korean martial artist
who entered the UFC...)

259
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,480
(with the most wins in the UFC)

260
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,880
(Stun Gun, Kim Dong Hyun)

261
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,360
(The genius and Korea's
youngest fighter to enter the UFC)

262
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,490
(Super Boy, Choi Doo Ho)

263
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,430
(What's today's race that will
feature the 4 muscular men?)

264
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,300
We have four guests here today.

265
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,840
And we will have
the Salary Fighter Race.

266
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,370
You'll be divided into two teams
with a trainer and a vice-trainer.

267
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,080
- Good.
- The guests selected the trainers.

268
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,610
Se Chan is the trainer,

269
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,910
- and Jae Suk is the vice trainer.
- Are you the trainer?

270
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,320
All right.

271
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,780
(The fighters selected
the petty trainers.)

272
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,860
- Are you the chairman?
- Are you the chairman?

273
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,110
- So Min, move over.
- Move over.

274
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,230
Gosh, this is...

275
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,380
You have the face of a chairman.

276
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,120
- This is about salary negotiation.
- The trainer?

277
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
So this is like...

278
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,930
- the rookie draft.
- Okay.

279
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,800
- Oh, that thing?
- The baseball thing.

280
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,990
The draft.

281
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,310
That means you should
get on my good side.

282
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,110
(This is a rookie draft
of the 9 athletes.)

283
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,240
First, Se Chan, who is
the chairman here, gets 400 dollars.

284
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,770
- I get 400 dollars?
- That's a lot.

285
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,110
Jae Suk, the vice chairman...

286
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,140
- gets 300 dollars.
- Come on.

287
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,550
Now, the trainers will
evaluate the athletes here...

288
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,780
- and recruit them to their teams.
- The draft.

289
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,590
- You should get on my good side.
- The trainers will pay...

290
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,560
the athletes their salaries
with the money they just got.

291
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,620
You should be in our good books.

292
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,390
At the end of the race,
between the two trainers,

293
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,390
- the one with more money will win.
- I see.

294
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,940
And the trainer who loses
will get a penalty.

295
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,990
- We will get a penalty?
- Yes.

296
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,730
Meanwhile,
the athletes need to earn...

297
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,030
as much salary as possible
through salary negotiations.

298
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,400
The two athletes with
the biggest salary will get prizes.

299
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,580
- And number nine gets a penalty.
- Okay.

300
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,640
Now, the two trainers will start
recruiting athletes.

301
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,380
To sum up, we should try
to pay as little salary as possible.

302
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,930
- That's right.
- And the athletes need to make...

303
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,700
- Get the biggest salary.
- as much money as possible.

304
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,200
- You should make it reasonable.
- We will pay reasonable salaries.

305
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,660
There aren't many athletes
who deserve a lot of money.

306
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,760
You know what?

307
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,860
I don't want those who can cause
a headache on my team.

308
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,400
But this is what I believe.

309
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,370
They all used to be
professional athletes,

310
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,710
so they would remember.
They're just like us.

311
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,950
- Okay.
- The thing is,

312
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,500
a salary is a matter of pride.

313
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,110
Please stay quiet.

314
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,680
- Quiet.
- It's a matter of personal pride.

315
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,780
- Be quiet.
- Silent.

316
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,220
I'm glad he brought it up.

317
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,780
- Pro sports are driven by money.
- Isn't that true?

318
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,220
- That's true.
- I agree.

319
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,960
So you can't just tell me...

320
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,860
- to think of the old days.
- Trainer Yang and I...

321
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,100
are willing to pay
a reasonable amount.

322
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,160
As far as I remember,
Trainer Yoo paid me 10 cents before.

323
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,260
Let's not do that.

324
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,660
- I get it. Just have a seat.
- Chan Sung.

325
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,860
Imagine your pay is lower than mine.

326
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,000
Wouldn't you be upset?

327
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,440
I have a strong sense of loyalty.
So I just get what they offer.

328
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,310
Don't lie.

329
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,320
- Listen to me.
- I know that's a lie.

330
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,140
- "Don't lie."
- Are you serious?

331
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,980
- I never betray my people.
- Wait.

332
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,640
I just need enough money to live on.

333
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,880
Jung Chan Sung, pass.

334
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,860
- All right. Jung Chan Sung.
- That's a lie.

335
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,360
- I like that attitude.
- Right.

336
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,190
- That's not true.
- Enough money to live on?

337
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,650
Listen to me.

338
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,120
- He talks a lot.
- Listen to me.

339
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
- Sung Hoon is talktative.
- Go ahead and talk.

340
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,130
I was talking about matches
with him the other day.

341
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,160
He said, "I'm not doing it
if I don't get enough money."

342
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,530
You said this.

343
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,610
- I know.
- All right, then.

344
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,580
Let me be honest with you.

345
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,140
It's all about money
for professional athletes.

346
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,740
- All right.
- My gosh.

347
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,480
- That's true.
- I want to get paid a lot.

348
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
- To buy rings and bracelets.
- Now that you say that...

349
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,240
It's your personal taste,
so I don't want to argue about that,

350
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,650
but I think you have
large expenditures.

351
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,830
You're wearing diamond earrings.

352
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,120
- And he's wearing bracelets.
- Aren't you also in...

353
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,560
the moneylending business.

354
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,860
(His flashy jewels catch
the stingy trainers' eyes.)

355
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,860
- "Moneylending business?"
- Look at the jewels.

356
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,700
- With the money he makes...
- You don't seem like an athlete.

357
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,760
Actually, every piece has
its own meaning.

358
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,570
- What meaning does this have?
- This is...

359
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,940
- You're wearing many bracelets.
- What meaning does a diamond have?

360
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,850
I bought all this
after I won a fight.

361
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,110
As a gift.

362
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,680
- When you win?
- I give it to myself when I win.

363
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,180
So it means something to me.

364
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,190
When I lose a match,

365
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,240
I sell one of them.

366
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,720
Really?

367
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,750
- So you don't have many left.
- I have only a few left.

368
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,730
- You have only a few pieces.
- Really?

369
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,860
He will probably lose them all soon.

370
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,750
Right. I have only four pieces left.

371
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,120
- That sounds very reasonable.
- That's funny.

372
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,260
It's a good idea.

373
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,340
- You buy it only when you win.
- You have your own reason.

374
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,230
- And you sell it when you lose.
- Right.

375
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,810
I buy one when I win.
That's what I do.

376
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,940
Sung Hoon, you are amazing.

377
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,680
Your career is impressive.

378
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,270
You used to be a judo athlete.

379
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,000
- That's right.
- That's what he used to do.

380
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,720
- He used to be an elite athlete.
- Right.

381
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,480
It's not like
he was an ordinary athlete.

382
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,140
- What is this?
- What?

383
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,360
What do we do with this?

384
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
(Laughing)

385
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,690
I mean... This is a little...

386
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,150
- Hang on a second.
- This...

387
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,560
- I'm not sure if I should read it.
- Which one?

388
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,800
- I'm not sure if this is okay...
- What is it?

389
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,390
"He's known not to wear underpants."

390
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,700
"He even said he would never
wear them for the rest of his life."

391
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,970
"He's known not to wear underpants."

392
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,110
"He even said he would never
wear them for the rest of his life."

393
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,310
What is this?
Are you still like that?

394
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,000
- Hey, it's just...
- Are you still like that?

395
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,240
Yes. I like not wearing underpants.

396
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,910
Actually, you're not supposed
to wear underpants in a judo match.

397
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,610
That's how I got into the habit.

398
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,720
Excuse me,
but are you not wearing any now?

399
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,690
- I'm at work now, so...
- You should wear them at work.

400
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,330
I do wear underpants these days.

401
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,960
But I wear a thong.

402
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,230
That's what I've been wearing.

403
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,020
Didn't you say you value comfort?

404
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,930
- Thongs?
- Aren't they uncomfortable?

405
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,230
Hold on a second.

406
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,260
- Thongs...
- But...

407
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,310
- What's wrong?
- It feels like something is stuck.

408
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,360
- Isn't it better to go commando?
- You just made me uncomfortable.

409
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,730
I'm uncomfortable with all this.

410
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,230
These days,
thongs are the way to go for men.

411
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,110
- Why is that?
- That's what we should wear.

412
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,580
- Why is that?
- Men wear them...

413
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,720
to get rid of panty lines.

414
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,850
Doesn't it feel like
you're walking on a tightrope?

415
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,850
But...

416
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,450
- A tightrope?
- Even with men,

417
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,220
it's also important
to have desirable buttocks.

418
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,150
If you wear underwear,
the outline of it will show.

419
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,860
I don't like seeing it on me, so...

420
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,250
- Back in the day...
- Yes?

421
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,860
A friend who works in the field
gave me one as a gift.

422
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
A thong?

423
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,360
Yes, he gave me three,
so I went out wearing them.

424
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,310
My wife said it was all right,
saying they were comfortable.

425
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,340
So I wore them.

426
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,850
After ten minutes,
I decided to put them on backward.

427
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,640
(Backward?)

428
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,450
- It was that uncomfortable?
- You put them on backward?

429
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,480
- How does that make sense?
- That's just as weird.

430
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,010
- How can you do that?
- The T part...

431
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,910
- It's pretty much the same.
- Backward...

432
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,590
The T part went in the front?

433
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,690
- I speak from experience.
- Hold on a second.

434
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,230
- Wait.
- The backside is too much.

435
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,860
- That's enough.
- It's just as bad in the front.

436
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,930
We're beginning a year...

437
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,860
- What's so wrong with that?
- talking about thongs.

438
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,860
- Why did you bring that up?
- I can't allocate much time.

439
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
Just be done with it.

440
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,800
Anyway, that was Sung Hoon.

441
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,210
- Right. Thanks.
- Next...

442
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,110
- We have Choi Doo Ho.
- The Korean Super Boy.

443
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,270
You...

444
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,400
He has many titles to his name.

445
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,500
You have no idea.

446
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,050
Aren't you the youngest here?

447
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,850
- That I am.
- You're 33.

448
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,510
- Lucky you.
- You're 33, so...

449
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,060
- So Min?
- Lucky him. He's the youngest.

450
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,980
- What are you doing?
- Why are you applying lipstick?

451
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,860
I got lipstick on my teeth,
that's all.

452
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,230
- Is that so?
- We never let things fly.

453
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,760
I'm informing you of this
just in case. He's married.

454
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,890
- Yes, he's married.
- Who?

455
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,890
- Who?
- He got married in 2017.

456
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,940
You mean, Doo Ho?

457
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,470
- Yes, he is a married man.
- Wait.

458
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,570
I apologize, but...

459
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,860
- Yes, he got married.
- Wait.

460
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,260
I apologize, but...

461
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,900
- He got divorced.
- I'm divorced now.

462
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,980
- Is that so?
- Gosh.

463
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,180
- I'm divorced now.
- Is that so?

464
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,270
(Oh, dear)

465
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,550
Why did you write it down?

466
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,110
(Oh, dear)

467
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,740
Goodness.

468
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,020
- Then...
- Was this really necessary?

469
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,460
Let's start over, then.

470
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,890
You should be on
"Invitation from Bachelor-agains."

471
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,100
- We'll correct that.
- Let us correct the facts.

472
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,430
We'll update his personnel file
with current facts.

473
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,230
Then...

474
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,110
- As of this moment, he's single.
- He's single!

475
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,210
I was married.

476
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,130
- It's been two and a half years.
- It's too funny to edit out.

477
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,680
- He was married, but...
- Sharing correct information...

478
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,180
is always important.

479
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,850
- Correct it online as well.
- Right.

480
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,980
It's not a bad way
to announce your divorce.

481
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,510
- Two and a half years ago.
- It's not so bad.

482
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,650
- We were late updating it.
- Okay.

483
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,290
- Anyway...
- It's understandable.

484
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,950
Being divorced isn't a flaw.

485
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,890
Next week, get ready for
"Invitation from Bachelor-agains."

486
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,330
Doo Ho can be on
"Invitation from Bachelor-agains."

487
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,920
- You can be on that show.
- I'll prepare for it right away.

488
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,540
Out of 19 matches,
he won 15 and only lost 4.

489
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,310
(Choi Doo Ho:
19 matches, 15 wins, 4 losses)

490
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,070
- How impressive.
- It really is impressive.

491
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,970
- Four losses...
- Well...

492
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,750
- In 2023...
- That's standard, right?

493
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,050
- There aren't many matches left.
- Dong Hyun's not agreeing.

494
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,320
- To what?
- Four losses.

495
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,170
Everyone here
only lost about four times.

496
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,440
We didn't lose many matches.

497
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,520
How many matches did you lose?

498
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,640
Only four.

499
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,110
- Really?
- You only lost four matches?

500
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,680
- Out of 30 matches, I lost 4.
- Really?

501
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,560
Why does it feel like
you lost more fights?

502
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,530
Why do I feel like I saw you
on the ground more?

503
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,530
We saw you lying
on the ground a lot.

504
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,800
- It feels that way.
- It's because...

505
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,460
the fights I lost
were worthy of highlight clips.

506
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,630
- I see.
- When he lost, he lost big.

507
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,110
I never went out swinging.

508
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,360
- That's right.
- I got knocked out.

509
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,930
- We saw you on the ground a lot.
- I know.

510
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,200
- I would get knocked out.
- You never went out swinging.

511
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,870
Sung Hoon lost seven matches.

512
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,250
That's quite a lot.

513
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,940
No wonder he doesn't have
much jewelry on him.

514
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,950
- Exactly.
- He should be wearing more.

515
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,880
- There should be more.
- I sold a lot of what I had.

516
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,860
Jung Chan Sung is your role model.

517
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,650
- Why is that?
- When I first started out,

518
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,960
people called me
the next Jung Chan Sung.

519
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,540
During the launching event
for the 2022 "Pure Fighter,"

520
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,740
you said this.

521
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,460
"Chan Sung has no funny bones,"

522
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,130
"and there wasn't anything
to learn from him."

523
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,550
(He actually said that.)

524
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,810
He said that
in a matter-of-fact way.

525
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,140
He's not wrong though.

526
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,520
- Really?
- That's the truth.

527
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,550
Isn't he funny at all?

528
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,880
Nothing he does is funny.

529
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,760
Chan Sung, tell us if it's true.

530
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,060
I have nothing to say.

531
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,030
- I also...
- He's sometimes funny though.

532
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,760
And on February 5, 2023,

533
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,460
at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas,

534
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,270
Doo Ho will make his comeback
after four years.

535
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,600
- That's what he has planned.
- That's right.

536
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,130
- The date's not that far away.
- I can't wait.

537
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,430
- It's in less than a month.
- Me too.

538
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,700
Next up is the Korean Zombie...

539
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,740
Jung Chan Sung.

540
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,470
His record speaks for itself.
17 wins and 7 losses.

541
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,970
In 2011, he won
the ESPN Submission of the Year...

542
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,370
- and has great fights.
- And many more.

543
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,910
- His victories were jaw-dropping.
- You're right.

544
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,910
He was the first Korean fighter
to compete in a UFC title fight.

545
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,220
- That's right.
- He fought in a title fight twice.

546
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,830
- Yes, twice.
- One was with Aldo.

547
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,120
There aren't many fighters...

548
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,420
who have fought
in a title fight twice.

549
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,720
- Really?
- It's very rare.

550
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,920
The UFC title fight
is more than just demanding.

551
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,160
- You have no idea.
- It's...

552
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,630
You wouldn't believe it.

553
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,510
- It's unprecedented.
- Exactly.

554
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,610
- That's right.
- Chan Sung is UFC itself.

555
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,900
And not just among Koreans.

556
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,400
- Look at him beaming.
- Out of all the fighters...

557
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,370
- You're loving this.
- Even among foreigners...

558
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,670
He has a lot of fans
outside of Korea as well.

559
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,280
- That's right.
- Is that so?

560
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,250
Every match he was in...

561
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,110
could be selected
as Match of the Year.

562
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,360
Whether he punched
his way to victory...

563
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,410
- Right.
- or won via submission.

564
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,380
He used unique techniques
and moves to win.

565
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,030
- They were cool to watch.
- That's right.

566
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,450
His matches were flashy.

567
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,500
Do you know why
he's called the Korean Zombie?

568
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,530
- Of course.
- Because he never yields.

569
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,920
- He never admits defeat.
- He kept on standing up.

570
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,740
You were known as the Cicada.

571
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,130
- Yes, the Cicada.
- The Cicada.

572
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,130
That was out of the blue.

573
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,430
- Why...
- He hung from his opponents.

574
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,200
- Hold on a second.
- He'd hang from his opponents.

575
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,040
His opponents
didn't have the strength to...

576
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,170
Hold on a second.

577
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,710
Was your name Kim Bong
before you had it changed?

578
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,080
- What?
- Why would you mention that?

579
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,290
Kim Bong?

580
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,590
Were you a pushover?

581
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,680
- Seriously? His name was Bong?
- Hold on a second.

582
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,450
It's written right here. "Kim Bong."

583
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,620
What's the Chinese character for it?

584
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,920
- I mean...
- Is this a joke?

585
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,500
Why would you talk about that
instead of my record?

586
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,930
- Was your name Kim Bong?
- It's not that bad.

587
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,100
Back in the day,

588
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,460
up until middle school,
my name was Kim Bong.

589
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,040
- You were a pushover.
- Until when?

590
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,900
- I'm sorry I laughed.
- I had it changed in ninth grade.

591
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,240
- For real?
- Yes.

592
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,110
My elementary school yearbook says
I am Kim Bong.

593
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,110
Bong.

594
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
Bong?

595
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,140
- Oh, dear.
- Dong Hyun.

596
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,750
- Yes?
- Why didn't we know about this?

597
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,110
Can I call you Bong
for the time being?

598
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,410
You should call yourself,
the Cicada Bong.

599
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,490
What?

600
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,180
You could take the market
from Maxbong sausage.

601
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,530
It sounds delicious.

602
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,600
Cicada Bong seems packed
with protein.

603
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,650
- Dong Hyun.
- Right?

604
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,890
Cicada Bong, I'm a pushover

605
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,460
The Cicada Bong.

606
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,160
- It'll bring in a lot of money.
- Bong.

607
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,660
Bong will be a hit.

608
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,740
This is what I went through
at the start of every year,

609
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,870
and that's why I had to
change my name.

610
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,780
At the beginning of the school year,
my classmates and my teachers...

611
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,050
I'd introduce myself as Kim Bong...

612
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,580
At first, the teacher would
put me down as Kim Bong Hee.

613
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,850
- Everyone starts off with that.
- Bong Hee?

614
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,290
I'd correct them and say "Kim Bong,"

615
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,290
and they'd put me down
as Kim Bong Yi.

616
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,360
I'd say that it's "Kim Bong."

617
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,360
Kim Bong!

618
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,620
- Just "Bong."
- It's like Bongyi Kim Sun Dal.

619
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,890
- Kim Bong Yi.
- You seem more approachable...

620
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,500
- thanks to the name.
- But...

621
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,190
Doesn't the name Bong
suit him though?

622
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,610
- Isn't it adorable?
- It's a pretty name.

623
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,510
- Bong is a hilarious name.
- Tell me about it.

624
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,930
You look like a Bong though.

625
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,040
Really?

626
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,170
- But I had too many nicknames.
- Like what?

627
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,820
Jjamppong, Pushover,
Bongyi Kim Sun Dal, and...

628
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,210
(Super childish)

629
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,180
Bongyi Kim Sun Dal?

630
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,260
- Like this.
- Jjamppong?

631
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,650
I called him
Bongyi Kim Sun Dal just now.

632
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,920
- Pushover.
- Bongyi Kim Sun Dal.

633
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,950
It's getting too hot for me.

634
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,950
Can I get a Bongbong?

635
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,650
They'd grab me and say
that they got lucky.

636
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,570
- I got lucky.
- Exactly.

637
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,860
That could also be one.

638
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,240
- The way I see it is...
- The name suits you though.

639
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,960
- It's a good fighter name though.
- That could be your name.

640
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,460
- Ladies and gentlemen!
- It's Bong Kim!

641
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,970
- Bong Kim.
- Bong Kim.

642
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,550
(His ring name makes him look weak.)

643
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,940
- Bong.
- See?

644
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,080
Kim Bong.

645
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,580
He's not wrong.
His record is remarkable too.

646
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,020
He won 22 matches and lost 4 times.

647
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,140
- That's not easy, you know.
- It's insane.

648
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,290
Didn't you make it...

649
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,650
- to 6th in the rankings?
- Yes, 6th.

650
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,560
Ranking sixth isn't easy...

651
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,420
since there are about 300 fighters
in that weight class.

652
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,460
Out of all of them, he ranked sixth
which is remarkable.

653
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,800
- Of course. It's amazing.
- It sure is.

654
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,040
Couldn't your opponents
make it out from under your grip?

655
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,430
- They couldn't. No one was able to.
- No way.

656
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,510
It was the death grip.

657
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,240
- It's that difficult.
- It's a natural talent, then.

658
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,640
When he's all wrapped around you
like a cicada...

659
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,750
and you whisper "Kim Bong"
in his ear...

660
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,640
(The way to escape his deadly grasp)

661
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,140
Can you please stop
with the name jokes?

662
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,990
- Gosh.
- Let's say I was like this.

663
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,260
Are you Kim Bong?

664
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,990
Please stop with the name jokes.

665
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,690
He survived the cutthroat field
thanks to this move of his.

666
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,000
What Sung Hoon is left with
are his thongs,

667
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,340
and Dong Hyun is left with
his name Kim Bong.

668
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,400
(Choo "Thongs" Sung Hoon
and Kim Bong)

669
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,630
We're left with just those two.

670
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,080
Anyway, we were able
to hear from the four fighters.

671
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,550
- What about the rest?
- The rest?

672
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,410
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

673
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,250
I don't know
what games we'll be playing today,

674
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,210
but whether I have to be funny or...

675
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,710
I'm good at games
where you need to be funny.

676
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,720
- He's naturally strong.
- He's good with anything...

677
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,220
that isn't forced or fake.

678
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,190
By the looks of it,
we have five fighters.

679
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,660
- The rest...
- The other four are rag dolls.

680
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,130
- Rag dolls?
- How about weaklings?

681
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,070
- Weaklings.
- Still, out of the four...

682
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,570
- Weaklings.
- Weaklings.

683
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,700
- Like Jeonsobari.
- I'm still above the other three.

684
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,440
Let us begin
salary negotiations, then.

685
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,350
They will come up to you
in groups of three.

686
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,090
The fighters can choose a prop
to show off their strengths.

687
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,820
They can show off other talents
when requested by the trainer.

688
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,560
First up, we have Choo Sung Hoon,
Choi Doo Ho, and Haha.

689
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,650
- Why is Haha in that group?
- Pardon?

690
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,060
I'm in the same group as them?

691
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,300
Oh, my. Why are you in that group?

692
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,830
Just as we said earlier,

693
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,130
let's not drag out negotiations.

694
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,340
We'll offer
as much as you seem to be worth.

695
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,110
- As much as you seem to be worth.
- Exactly. We'll do so.

696
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,510
He must be in great shape now
if he has a match in a month.

697
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,540
Oh, my. I mean...

698
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,940
He doesn't even have to show us.
We all know how great he is.

699
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,550
- It's an honor for me.
- I'm flattered.

700
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,320
My, this is insane. I'm amazed.

701
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
(His body is so muscular.
He's in his best shape.)

702
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,380
He has such a muscular body.

703
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,990
Of course.
He must be in his best shape now.

704
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,110
Why don't each of you tell us...

705
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,380
- Sell yourselves.
- Tell us about your abilities.

706
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,220
Doo Ho, what are you good at?

707
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,300
I have good dodging skills.

708
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,660
- Dodging skills?
- You're good at dodging?

709
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,030
If you throw this ball at me,
I'd never get hit.

710
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,340
- Really?
- Show us how you dodge a punch.

711
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,500
- That's a good idea.
- I'll do it.

712
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,010
- Jong Kook will do it.
- I might get hit if you punch me.

713
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,110
Then you can't say
that you're good at it.

714
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,750
- You can dodge a table tennis ball?
- That's right.

715
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,470
- Even from a short distance.
- Oh, really?

716
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,850
I can dodge it if you're this close.

717
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,550
- No way.
- No way.

718
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,520
- Come on. I don't believe you.
- You mean, your face only, right?

719
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,610
- Then we'll give you three chances.
- Okay.

720
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,710
- He'll get hit all three times.
- I'll throw it from here.

721
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,620
- Stand closer to him.
- Right. You'll throw at his face.

722
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,180
- You can go closer to him.
- Can I throw it from here?

723
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,220
- Closer than that.
- I think he'll get hit.

724
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
Ready. Go.

725
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,620
He didn't get hit.

726
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,030
Ready. Go.

727
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,270
(He dodged it!)

728
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,300
- That was close.
- He threw it too lightly.

729
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,770
Suk Jin threw it too slowly.

730
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,840
- You should throw it more quickly.
- Suk Jin threw it too slowly.

731
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
(He dodged another ball!)

732
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,900
- He's right, Suk Jin.
- No.

733
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,040
- I think he's just bad at aiming.
- I'll throw it hard...

734
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
That's not true.

735
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,050
- I predicted your move.
- Okay. I understand.

736
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,050
Here we go.

737
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,440
- He got hit.
- Here we go.

738
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,110
(Strike)

739
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,380
- What was that?
- Forget it.

740
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,180
- What was that?
- Doo Ho, that's enough.

741
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,150
- He predicted my move. That's why.
- I'll offer you 20 cents.

742
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,620
- No. I threw it in the middle.
- I mean...

743
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,190
I didn't predict his move.
I just threw it forward.

744
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,650
He said he was good at dodging.
But what was that?

745
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,000
- What was that?
- And I heard a loud noise.

746
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
- He got hit really hard.
- It made a loud noise.

747
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,430
- Doo Ho, are you okay? I'm sorry.
- I'm fine.

748
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,610
We can't pay you much.

749
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,040
Is there anything else
you want to show us?

750
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,470
- Sung Hoon?
- Sung Hoon, it's your turn.

751
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,110
- Well... Then...
- Oh, my.

752
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,820
- Actually, I injured my leg.
- I see.

753
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,170
- So I can't move easily now.
- Okay.

754
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,910
Oh, all right.
That'll affect their offers.

755
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,020
Instead, I will show both of you...

756
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,320
my thong.

757
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,330
(He'll reveal his thong.)

758
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,360
- He'll show one side for each?
- Hey, what are you doing?

759
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,720
- Why would he show them his thong?
- What is going on?

760
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,920
- Let's go over there.
- Why should we see your thong?

761
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,270
- I'll show you.
- Why should we see it?

762
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,430
- That's ridiculous.
- Why are you standing like that?

763
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,360
- What are you talking about?
- I can just pull my pants down.

764
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,270
My gosh. I mean, why would he...

765
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,430
- offer to show us his thong?
- Who would do that during a draft?

766
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,310
- Okay. Step back again for now.
- Don't show us your thong.

767
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,670
If things like that count,
I'll show you everything.

768
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,550
Anyway, Sung Hoon, we understand.

769
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,490
- He has an injured leg now.
- Right.

770
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,490
We'll take it into consideration.

771
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,490
- Haha, you're up.
- Haha.

772
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,290
I'll demonstrate
my dynamic visual acuity.

773
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,380
- What did you say?
- The dynamic visual acuity test?

774
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,120
The one
where you put it around your head?

775
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
- Do you hit it?
- How does it work?

776
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,270
I'll show you...
I haven't done this in a while.

777
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,030
- I'm not sure if I can do it well.
- How does it work?

778
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,390
Give me a second.

779
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,040
- I can tell he's done it before.
- How does it work?

780
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,740
- What's that?
- I'm ready. I'll start.

781
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,930
Two, three, four...

782
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,310
- I can't do it as I want.
- He's not good at it.

783
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,110
- Wait. Give me another chance.
- No.

784
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,310
(He begs for another chance
after three seconds.)

785
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,110
- That was disappointing.
- I already wrote it down.

786
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,210
I wrote down your salary
even before you came out.

787
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,590
Haha, he'll offer you one cent.

788
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,710
I asked you to offer me
more than one cent. Jae Suk.

789
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,060
You should've demonstrated
shadowboxing, at least.

790
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,720
Now, we'll start the negotiation...

791
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,800
since there's no need to drag it on.

792
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,190
We'll decide on your salaries first.

793
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,630
- We'll start at a low salary.
- You see, this is...

794
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,310
- You should consider that.
- Oh, man.

795
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,570
All right. We're ready.

796
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,430
Ready. One, two, three.

797
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,040
(Trainer Yang's offer,
Trainer Yoo's offer)

798
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,370
- His offer is 4.8 and 3.5 dollars.
- It's strange.

799
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,550
- It's 4.8 dollars and 3.5 dollars.
- What?

800
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,470
- Five dollars.
- That's so low.

801
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,820
- Three dollars and three cents.
- What?

802
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,370
- I wrote 2 cents.
- Only 3 cents?

803
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,820
(Trainer Yang's offer,
Trainer Yoo's offer)

804
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,940
- You increased it by one cent.
- Yes.

805
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,090
I increased it by 100 percent.
I was going to offer him 1 cent.

806
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,620
They're all so disappointed.

807
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,420
It's because we need money
to manage our team.

808
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,560
- Right.
- Doo Ho will definitely join...

809
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,220
- Jae Suk's team.
- Yes. I'm happy with his offer.

810
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,920
- He offered 50 cents more.
- Right.

811
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,190
I'll pay Sung Hoon 4.80 dollars.

812
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,510
- I got the best offers among us.
- I'll pay you 20 cents more.

813
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,840
Sung Hoon seems very disappointed
with our offers.

814
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,110
- He got 300 dollars earlier.
- He received 300 dollars,

815
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,470
- but he offered only 3.50 dollars.
- You offered him only 4.80 dollars?

816
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,850
- It's not even 48 dollars.
- That's too little.

817
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,520
- They received 300 and 400 dollars.
- This is only the beginning.

818
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,020
- We'll give you a raise later.
- This is only the beginning.

819
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
- Will you give me a raise?
- Yes.

820
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,550
I'll see how well you do.

821
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,320
- We'll negotiate again.
- You'll get a raise eventually.

822
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,360
Don't worry about it.

823
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,030
- I'll choose my team right away.
- Okay.

824
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,360
- Which team is it?
- I'll join Trainer Yoo's team.

825
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,650
- Great. Okay.
- Of course, he chose that team.

826
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,530
- Right. Of course.
- Of course, he wants to get paid...

827
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,190
- as much as he can.
- I offered 50 cents more.

828
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,100
He has less money
but is offering a higher salary.

829
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
That's right.

830
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,500
Good. Next up is Sung Hoon.

831
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,130
- Obviously, I choose him.
- Trainer Yang?

832
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,540
- Thank you.
- Trainer Yang? Okay.

833
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,460
- Yes. He offered me more money.
- That's right.

834
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,840
- Of course.
- He offered only 20 cents more.

835
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,340
- Please return to your seat.
- Of course.

836
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,050
- Okay.
- He should pick the higher salary.

837
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,610
- I never thought...
- Whose team will you join?

838
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,210
I'd contemplate because of one cent.

839
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,320
- Seriously.
- Hurry up.

840
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,910
- How the team grows matters.
- Right.

841
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,650
Let's make it work with Sung Hoon.

842
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,610
I'll raise your salary later. I have
100 dollars more than he does.

843
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,120
- What's your decision?
- I'll follow you to the end.

844
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,500
- Okay. Good.
- My gosh. I'm disappointed.

845
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,030
(Haha accepted three cents
and chose Trainer Yang.)

846
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,030
He chose his team for money
after all.

847
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,040
- It matters the most.
- I'll get paid only three cents!

848
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,540
He made his decision
because of money.

849
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,630
Only three cents.

850
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,660
Who are up next?

851
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,630
Jung Chan Sung, Kim Dong Hyun,
and Kim Jong Kook.

852
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,750
- They're all great.
- They're all amazing.

853
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,900
We'll probably offer a lot of money.

854
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,320
- Oh, my. It's intense.
- It'll be a fierce competition.

855
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,610
- I have nothing to show them.
- It's fierce.

856
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,320
- Right. It'll be fierce.
- The three of us are left.

857
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,410
Right. The three of us are left.

858
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,320
- They're similarly strong.
- Indeed.

859
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,090
- They could have a real match.
- Exactly.

860
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,260
(The three of them look
incredibly charismatic.)

861
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,920
- I'll just try this or something.
- First...

862
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,120
We should see what they're good at.

863
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,270
- Let's start with Bong.
- Okay.

864
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,530
I will...

865
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,270
Do something like
eating sausage fast.

866
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,010
- I'm good at that. I can eat fast.
- Right.

867
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,900
But unlike these legendary fighters,

868
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,400
- my specialty is wrestling,
- Yes.

869
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,140
- grappling, and jiu-jitsu.
- I see.

870
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,640
- Yes. So...
- You'll do it right here?

871
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,710
- So...
- How will you do it here?

872
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,610
My point is
that I have good balance.

873
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,180
- I see.
- It's hard to throw me down.

874
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,820
But I can throw anyone down easily.

875
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,530
That's what I'm best at.
So I'll show you how I keep balance.

876
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,650
- Okay. It's important.
- You never fall down?

877
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,760
Having good balance is great.

878
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,830
- Will you stand on it?
- I will...

879
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,100
jump with both feet on this ball.

880
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
- Really?
- How?

881
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,130
- Really?
- For real?

882
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,270
- Go ahead. We'll catch you.
- Grab me if you think you'll fall.

883
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,010
- Okay.
- Grab us if you think you'll fall.

884
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,740
- Okay. I'll start.
- Yes.

885
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,470
I tried this many times
when I was younger.

886
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,850
- Like this. I'll do it again.
- Wait. Didn't you just fall?

887
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,910
- Can't you stand on top of it?
- I think you fell off the ball.

888
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,250
- On top of it?
- Yes.

889
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,750
You fell off the ball.

890
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,850
- I already showed you.
- What we pictured was this.

891
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,090
- Jumping up and standing here.
- I just showed you.

892
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,710
- I thought you'd stand on the ball.
- What was that?

893
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,030
- Exactly.
- Can't you do that?

894
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,380
I stood almost on top of it.
It wasn't so different.

895
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,500
- No. You stepped on here.
- Try again.

896
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,720
- No.
- Try again.

897
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,300
- Try to hold out for longer.
- Yes.

898
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,660
- You need a strong lower body.
- I held out for so long.

899
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,240
- How long will you hold out?
- Try again.

900
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,860
- As long as I want.
- How about five seconds?

901
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,890
- He said, "As long as I want."
- One.

902
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,460
- As long as I want.
- What was that?

903
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,540
- They're all bluffers.
- Right.

904
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,540
(Bong the Bluffer)

905
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,580
- I don't think he can do it.
- Hold out for five seconds. One.

906
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,850
- I made it.
- Two.

907
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,710
- I'm doing it the right way.
- Isn't he standing too low?

908
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,750
- But that's...
- Okay. Bong, that's enough for now.

909
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,020
- It was good enough, right?
- Bong, you can step back for now.

910
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,180
That wasn't really... All right.

911
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,220
- I can stand on top of it too.
- Yes.

912
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,120
- I can do it, but...
- Show us. One, two, three.

913
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,450
- I mean...
- Show us.

914
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,530
- Hold our hands. Ready, go.
- Stand on top of it.

915
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,500
- Like this?
- Yes, that's what we expected.

916
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,420
Clearly, you can't do it.

917
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,240
(Bong lost his balance
and ended up making everyone laugh.)

918
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,740
- Hey, you would never pull it off.
- Okay. Step back for now.

919
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,130
You would never pull it off.

920
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,270
- Next up is Jong Kook.
- Never.

921
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,930
- Yes?
- What will you show us?

922
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,670
I can't think of anything
to show you.

923
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,780
- How about shadowboxing?
- Show them your powerful punches.

924
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,050
- My punches?
- Do shadowboxing.

925
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,050
- Okay.
- He'll do shadowboxing?

926
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,410
- I'll start.
- Okay. Good. Keep going.

927
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,650
- What do you think?
- Keep going.

928
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,320
Hold on.

929
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,260
Wait. Stop. Who is punching here?

930
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,620
- He's a fraud.
- Hold on. What are you doing?

931
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,390
- Why did you tap his gloves?
- What's wrong?

932
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,570
- You did well. That was fun.
- He's a fraud.

933
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,300
- He swung the mitts like this.
- That was good.

934
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,930
- My gosh.
- He's a fraud.

935
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,460
- When you do this...
- He has a fun way of doing it.

936
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,700
That way, you can make a beginner
look stronger.

937
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,670
- Let's do it again.
- That's cool.

938
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,900
(They demonstrate their fake boxing
once again.)

939
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,310
(They have amazing teamwork.)

940
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,970
- It must be harder for Dong Hyun.
- That's good.

941
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,610
- Oh, my. Bong is...
- It's harder for Bong.

942
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,520
I see that
Bong is good at funny acts.

943
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,090
I want to give it a try.

944
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,450
Anyone can be a master
when practicing with me.

945
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,720
I didn't know
that Bong was good at that.

946
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,330
Chan Sung, what are you good at?

947
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,530
- I'll show you my kicks.
- Okay.

948
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,620
- Oh, he'll show us his kicks.
- His kicks?

949
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,030
- Can you hold the mitts for me?
- Oh, my.

950
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,240
- You should do it.
- Do we have one more?

951
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,740
Will you demonstrate a middle kick?

952
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,860
- Yes, a middle kick.
- We have one more.

953
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Make it sound louder.

954
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,070
Sure. I'm good at that.

955
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,510
- They...
- Did you hear what they said?

956
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,110
- "Make it sound louder."
- He asked to make it sound louder.

957
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,550
(Even the international fighter
wants to make a louder noise.)

958
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,050
Don't worry about it.
I'm good at that.

959
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,750
Jong Kook showed his punches, so...

960
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,610
This is really enjoyable, right?

961
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,020
We all should know
that it's an honor for us.

962
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,650
Indeed. They're all
internationally recognized fighters.

963
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,490
- The internationally recognized...
- Oh, my.

964
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,620
- This is really...
- I'm worried his pants might burst.

965
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,420
They're professionals.

966
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,460
- I'm worried his pants might burst.
- Are you wearing underwear?

967
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,930
- Why don't fighters wear underwear?
- Yes, I am.

968
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,240
- I'm wearing underwear for sure.
- Okay.

969
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,900
Look at his hips and thighs.

970
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,040
(His demonstration starts!)

971
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,700
- I think that's high enough.
- I like the sound.

972
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,640
(Exaggerating)

973
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,810
One more time.

974
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,320
One more time.

975
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,910
(Bong is practically blown away.)

976
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,290
You exaggerated, right?
You overacted, didn't you?

977
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,560
No, it wasn't like that.
I rarely get pushed back.

978
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,650
Hey, hold the mitts for me too.

979
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,360
- I rarely get pushed back.
- Hold the mitts for me too.

980
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,920
- It's hard to push me back.
- He makes his trainees feel good.

981
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
But he faked it.

982
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,830
His gym is really good.

983
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,000
The trainer at this gym is so good
at holding mitts.

984
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
(He kicks once in a satisfying way.)

985
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,460
- Let me try it again.
- That was amazing.

986
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
- Look. There's a waiting line.
- Let me try it again.

987
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,740
- You're so strong.
- He's so good at this.

988
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,660
- He's so good at it.
- I could feel it in my bones.

989
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,900
Why is he promoting his gym here?

990
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,200
- I just bought a membership.
- Come on.

991
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,950
Don't get fooled.

992
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,550
Are you okay?

993
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,280
(The mitts knocked Suk Jin out.)

994
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,450
(The bold So Min also came
to the popular gym.)

995
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,510
- That was good.
- He's really good at it.

996
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,990
Look at So Min. What is she doing?

997
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,160
- What is So Min doing?
- Good job.

998
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
What are you doing?

999
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,530
I want to see
some more of his kicks.

1000
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,120
- Chan Sung, show us one more time.
- She's strong.

1001
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,430
- She's really strong.
- Show us your knee kick too.

1002
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,490
- Chan Sung, show us.
- Five kicks.

1003
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,260
- He'll repeat kicks.
- That's good.

1004
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,640
(Awesome)

1005
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,840
Chan Sung, I want you on my team.

1006
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,450
(The two trainers are mesmerized by
Korean Zombie.)

1007
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:57,550
- I want Chan Sung.
- Did you hear that?

1008
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,820
- Oh, my.
- Chan Sung, I want you on my team.

1009
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,180
- He's incredible.
- I want you on my team.

1010
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,720
- That was insane.
- He's amazing.

1011
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,050
I'm impressed. That was incredible.

1012
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,950
- He's really strong as expected.
- Right.

1013
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,550
I can feel it in my bones.

1014
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,760
I'll see bruises on my arms
tomorrow.

1015
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,430
I like how he described it.
"I can feel it in my bones."

1016
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,260
- I mean...
- He responds enthusiastically.

1017
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,070
- You're strong too.
- Did it hurt when I kicked?

1018
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,260
No, it didn't hurt.

1019
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,740
- But I could feel it.
- Really?

1020
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,160
You'll improve greatly
if you practice for three months.

1021
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,030
(You'll improve greatly
if you practice for three months.)

1022
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,570
- My gosh. He's promoting his gym.
- He's promoting his gym.

1023
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,240
- He's promoting his gym.
- His gym is at Garosu-gil.

1024
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,570
He says So Min will improve greatly
in three months.

1025
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,720
- She's not very strong now.
- He's a businessman.

1026
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,680
But she'll be good at kicking
enough to defend herself.

1027
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,510
You can see Dong Hyun at his gym.

1028
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,050
- Really?
- At his gym.

1029
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,890
- Really?
- He's there occasionally.

1030
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,360
- You should go at the right timing.
- True.

1031
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,030
- Now...
- I'll spend more money this time.

1032
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,260
I'm offering high salaries too.

1033
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,720
- I knew it.
- They'll be offered a lot of money.

1034
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,890
- Oh, my.
- Ten dollars?

1035
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,340
I'm offering Chan Sung ten dollars
because of his kicks.

1036
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,110
- Hey, come on.
- About five dollars.

1037
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,410
I'll pay Jong Kook 50 cents.

1038
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,870
(Se Chan's offer for Dong Hyun:
4.30 dollars, Jae Suk's: 4 dollars)

1039
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,740
- My offer is 4.90 dollars.
- I'll pay Jong Kook 50 cents.

1040
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,340
- What? Oh, my.
- I'll pay you a lot.

1041
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,950
- Jong Kook.
- Fifty cents?

1042
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,470
- I'll pay you a lot.
- He's offering me a lot.

1043
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,970
It's because
you're as strong as the fighters.

1044
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,390
- Oh, my.
- I think you can beat Dong Hyun.

1045
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,410
That's why I'm offering you more.
You would definitely beat him.

1046
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,620
- I lost to him in many games.
- You see...

1047
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,660
I beat him in several games.

1048
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,220
- That's right.
- On variety shows.

1049
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,890
- I lost to him many times.
- Now...

1050
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,800
- Let's start with Bong.
- Okay. Bong will go first.

1051
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,590
- Well, four dollars...
- Four dollars.

1052
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,840
It's not easy to keep balance
on a gym ball. That's too little.

1053
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,610
But think about it.
The starting salary is four dollars,

1054
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,970
- but it could keep increasing.
- True.

1055
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,870
But it's easier to get a raise
when you start with a high salary.

1056
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,140
- Right.
- You talk too much.

1057
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,450
- But that's true.
- He talks too much.

1058
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,640
- I'll join Se Chan's team.
- Okay!

1059
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,090
- Jong Kook, what about you?
- Me?

1060
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,090
- It's obvious.
- Yes.

1061
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,410
Isn't it obvious? I choose Se Chan.

1062
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,160
- I mean, that's a big difference.
- It's a big difference.

1063
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,180
- I'm joining Chairman Yang's team.
- Okay!

1064
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,220
(He picks Chairman Yang!)

1065
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,990
- Then...
- We're on the same team.

1066
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,800
- I was mesmerized by your kicks.
- He's offering such a high salary.

1067
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,490
- I'd be loyal if I'm paid decently.
- Yes.

1068
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,470
- I choose Jae Suk.
- Okay. Good.

1069
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,930
- Okay.
- Our team is very strong.

1070
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,910
- His kicks were amazing.
- Our team is the best!

1071
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,070
- Okay.
- We're so strong.

1072
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,110
I'm happy with our team.

1073
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,280
Now, let's meet the last group.

1074
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,740
(The three weaklings are
in the last group.)

1075
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,870
- Good.
- Okay.

1076
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,050
Oh, my. What is she doing?

1077
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,950
(She tries to impress them
with her unique performances.)

1078
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,990
She's trying to make us laugh.

1079
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,620
- You don't clench your fists hard.
- Really?

1080
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,430
I saw some people holding a lighter
in their hands like this.

1081
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,550
(I saw some people holding a lighter
in their hands like this.)

1082
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,430
- That's an old trick.
- She...

1083
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,970
- She won't be helpful for the team.
- I'm surprised.

1084
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,970
- I'll sit on the gym ball.
- Really?

1085
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,840
- I won't fall down.
- Even if I push you?

1086
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,840
(Falling down)

1087
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,660
- What is this?
- What are you doing?

1088
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,070
(The last one is
the powerful Ji Hyo.)

1089
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,470
- She's so strong.
- His gym will become successful.

1090
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,870
I must admit,
your business will be successful.

1091
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,050
- What's shocking is...
- Yes.

1092
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,180
that the total amount is
less than ten cents.

1093
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,680
(The total amount is
less than ten cents.)

1094
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,010
My goodness.

1095
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,010
(Suk Jin: 2, 3 cents, Ji Hyo:
5, 4 cents, So Min: 1, 3 cents)

1096
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,890
My gosh. Three cents and one cent?

1097
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,360
Three cents.

1098
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,430
- That's just about right.
- One cent?

1099
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,860
I have to join the team
for only three cents.

1100
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,390
- It hurts my pride so much.
- I...

1101
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,030
But I'll join his team.

1102
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,470
You can just pay me three cents.

1103
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,760
- Seok Sam, you're on our team.
- Yes. I'll join your team.

1104
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,410
- Gosh. I'm so upset.
- I...

1105
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,610
- choose Chairman Yang.
- I choose Jae Suk.

1106
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,200
- Oh, my. Thank you.
- Okay, So Min.

1107
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,430
- Welcome to the team. Okay.
- I'll raise your salary later.

1108
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,470
- Thank you.
- I'll give you a raise later.

1109
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,470
We would've been offered less money
if we went first.

1110
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,550
- Think about Haha.
- But it's too little.

1111
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,140
Okay. The teams have been decided.

1112
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,390
On Team Yoo,
there are Doo Ho, Chan Sung,

1113
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,590
Suk Jin, and So Min.

1114
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,090
- Well, we...
- Our team is weak.

1115
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,930
On Team Yang,
there are Sung Hoon, Haha,

1116
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,200
- Dong Hyun, Jong Kook,
- They have strong ones.

1117
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,890
- and Ji Hyo.
- The other team is so strong.

1118
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,120
The guest ripped off
the members' name tags earlier.

1119
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,740
Those who ripped off two name tags
will receive extra three dollars.

1120
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,030
(They receive three dollars
for a bonus.)

1121
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,200
- Chan Sung has the most money.
- I ripped off two name tags.

1122
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,530
After you change into
comfortable clothes,

1123
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,780
- we'll begin the race.
- Okay.

1124
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,410
- That was so funny.
- Our team is so weak.

1125
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,120
Chan Sung is younger than me.

1126
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,840
But Se Chan addresses him
as someone older than him.

1127
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,220
(Chan Sung is younger than me.
But Se Chan uses honorifics.)

1128
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,220
Jae Suk,
Chan Sung is younger than me.

1129
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,720
- Chan Sung is?
- Bong!

1130
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,550
- I wish you guys were the same age.
- So Min, stop it.

1131
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,760
Really? How old are you?

1132
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,120
I was born in 1987.

1133
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,430
You're way younger than me.

1134
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,700
- Are you proud?
- I feel great.

1135
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,200
Because he's younger than me,
I feel like I'm stronger than him.

1136
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,700
- Right?
- I thought he was older than me.

1137
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,990
Let's sit down.

1138
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,110
- Please sit with your team.
- Where? Oh, I see.

1139
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,160
- Bong!
- Sit there.

1140
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,240
All right.

1141
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
We'll begin the first mission.

1142
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,510
It's Pure Brain Fighter.

1143
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,570
(The first mission is
Pure Brain Fighter.)

1144
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,970
- "Brain Fighter?" Gosh.
- As many times as you get...

1145
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,340
the correct answer in the quiz game,

1146
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,180
you get to hit the punching machine.

1147
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,410
- What about Bong?
- It's a team competition.

1148
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,160
- The team...
- We should get many answers.

1149
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,890
with the highest score will win.

1150
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,360
The other team is at an advantage.

1151
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,530
- But you're better at quiz games.
- That's not true.

1152
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,390
- We have to get answers first.
- Right.

1153
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,490
Bong might not get to hit it at all.

1154
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,300
But... I know that I may be...

1155
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,570
- below the average,
- Yes.

1156
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,110
but I'm on a high level
among fighters.

1157
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,930
(I'm on a high level
among fighters.)

1158
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,340
- Really?
- I'm on a very high level.

1159
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,280
- Including Sung Hoon,
- Really?

1160
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,070
- Doo Ho, and Chan Sung, right?
- That's good.

1161
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,640
I mean, among all of the fighters,

1162
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,910
- I'd be ranked high.
- I see.

1163
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,320
- I'm like a Mensa member.
- He...

1164
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,510
- What are you talking about?
- Including all of them, right?

1165
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,680
(Kim Bong claims to be an elite
among fighters.)

1166
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,320
- Is it a difficult question?
- Yes, it is.

1167
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,550
- A difficult question?
- Really?

1168
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,090
- The topic is general knowledge.
- We can skip this one.

1169
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,950
- Difficult questions are better.
- Here's your first question.

1170
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,720
- Wait.
- Hey.

1171
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,640
I know him. He's an artist.

1172
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,840
Isn't he the scientist
from the movie "Back to the Future?"

1173
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,240
- I can't see the photo.
- I can't see it.

1174
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,970
- As I've aged, I can't see well.
- I can't...

1175
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,640
I can't remember his name.
What should I do?

1176
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,970
I can't remember his name.

1177
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,910
- Oh, he's...
- The Madonna painting.

1178
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,070
- Is that person Madonna?
- Oh, him.

1179
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,370
My gosh.

1180
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,680
You have to write down his name.

1181
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,450
(Andy Warhol)

1182
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,860
I can't remember his name.

1183
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,450
- The Madonna painting.
- I wrote down my answer.

1184
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,800
Is that person Madonna?

1185
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,430
Is that person Madonna?

1186
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,660
Madonna?

1187
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,800
- "The Madonna painting?"
- Write that down.

1188
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,530
- Write that down for now.
- I couldn't hear him clearly.

1189
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,030
- "The Madonna painting?"
- Just write that down.

1190
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,530
- Hey, Madonna is...
- Gosh. Hold on.

1191
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,470
- That's a man.
- Oh, is that a man?

1192
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,140
- He's a man.
- Just write it down for now.

1193
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,680
- He appeared in a movie, right?
- Exactly.

1194
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,300
- That's right.
- There's a movie.

1195
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,410
- He acted in "Back to the Future."
- Gosh, no.

1196
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,720
What movie did he play in?

1197
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,390
It's total chaos over there.

1198
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,640
Doo Ho and Chan Sung,
do you know the answer?

1199
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,390
I got a feeling.

1200
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,950
- Really? Write that down.
- I got a feeling.

1201
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,450
I wrote it down.

1202
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,300
(Chan Sung's answer is "Lincoln,"
and Doo Ho's is "Einstein.")

1203
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,890
- Gosh. I know who he is.
- What movie was it?

1204
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,620
- Sung Hoon, did you write it down?
- What... Yes?

1205
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,970
- No.
- Give me just one letter.

1206
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,010
- We'll show you a related painting.
- Oh, no. Let me...

1207
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,910
- Right. That's Madonna.
- Yes, Madonna.

1208
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,340
- She's Marilyn Monroe.
- Marilyn Monroe.

1209
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,970
Oh, boy. I'm embarrassed.

1210
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,970
Marilyn Monroe.

1211
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,180
- Marilyn Monroe.
- He said she was Madonna.

1212
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,680
- Marilyn Monroe.
- Only the two of us didn't know.

1213
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,910
He's the father of artwork.

1214
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,450
What did you say? Art?

1215
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,510
The father of artwork.

1216
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,260
It's pop art, not artwork.

1217
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,390
Is it?

1218
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,720
Pop art?

1219
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,780
Should we write down
the name of that person?

1220
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,450
- No, that's not the question.
- I see.

1221
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,360
He wasn't searching it
on the internet.

1222
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,930
- He asked if that was the question.
- Right.

1223
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,700
It's total chaos here.

1224
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,490
- Doo Ho got confused.
- Hey, tell me just one letter.

1225
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,760
(Did Chan Sung write
the correct answer?)

1226
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,430
- You have three seconds left.
- Wait.

1227
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,070
- Wait.
- Just a second.

1228
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,740
- Should we write her name?
- No.

1229
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,550
- You're not allowed to search it...
- Wait.

1230
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,680
- on the internet. Put your phone...
- That's not what he's doing.

1231
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,840
- "Should we write her name?"
- He's not searching it. Trust me.

1232
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,740
No. Wait. My gosh.

1233
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,120
- Wait. Give me a second.
- Tell me just one letter.

1234
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,050
One, two, three.

1235
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,050
Show your board.

1236
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,180
Oh, right. It's Andy Warhol.

1237
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,930
- I've never heard that name before.
- Ji Hyo.

1238
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,660
- Did you copy his answer?
- So Min, did you copy my answer?

1239
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,030
- I was the first one to write it.
- I know who he is.

1240
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,260
Who is Andy Warhol?

1241
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,570
(Chan Sung's answer
he was sure of is "DiCaprio.")

1242
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,160
He wrote "DiCaprio,"
and he wrote "Einstein."

1243
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,570
- Who is "Taken?"
- "Taken?"

1244
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,840
Who's the lead actor of "Taken?"

1245
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,030
"Warren Buffett."

1246
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,800
"Jason Pop Art?"

1247
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,930
Pop art?

1248
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,070
(He wrote "Pop Art" as a name.)

1249
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,610
- Sung Hoon, what did you write?
- "Jason Pop Art?"

1250
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,820
I couldn't write anything. Gosh.

1251
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,140
- My gosh. Their answers are funny.
- So Min got the correct answer?

1252
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,390
Three members of this team got it right.
So Team Yoo wins.

1253
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,390
- We won easily.
- Gosh. I'm so frustrated.

1254
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,950
But Andy Warhol is...

1255
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,530
Who is he?
Oh, you won't explain to us.

1256
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,090
- He's a pop artist.
- He's a pop artist.

1257
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,030
- Here goes your second question.
- He's a pop artist.

1258
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,070
- Oh, that's a difficult question.
- Oh, yes.

1259
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,870
- That's easy.
- A piece of something.

1260
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,700
That's... Don't we all know that?

1261
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,390
It's a very easy word.

1262
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,840
(What should be in the blank?
The answer: Cake)

1263
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,930
- A piece of... What was the word?
- I can't remember the word.

1264
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,370
- It means something is very easy.
- It's a very easy word.

1265
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,110
- I know many English expressions.
- Do you know the answer or not?

1266
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,820
- I know. I've finished writing it.
- Do you?

1267
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,680
- Really? You already wrote it down?
- I'm done.

1268
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,720
- Chan Sung, Doo Ho, are you done?
- Yes.

1269
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,220
They never ask.

1270
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,220
(Chan Sung's answer is "war,"
and Doo Ho's is "soup.")

1271
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,950
- They...
- In what situation...

1272
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,760
In what situation
do you use this expression?

1273
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,620
- It's an English proverb.
- I'm not sure.

1274
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,300
- One.
- Wait.

1275
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,660
That's too quick.

1276
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,530
- You should give us time to think.
- Come on, Sung Hoon.

1277
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,760
- How much more time do you need?
- I need a lot of time to think.

1278
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,390
Jong Kook, do they use
this expression often?

1279
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,740
- They say that very often.
- Really?

1280
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,030
This is... Wait.

1281
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,160
- You don't know the answer?
- It's not a variation.

1282
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,010
- A piece of this.
- "A piece of"...

1283
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,110
- It's a commonly used expression.
- I see.

1284
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,870
This one is easy.

1285
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,550
(He smiles after saying,
"This one is easy.")

1286
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,140
Is it "pie?"

1287
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,280
- Three seconds are left. Three.
- Let's go.

1288
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,890
It's 1 of the 2 words... Wait.

1289
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,260
- I should go with this word.
- Let's go.

1290
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,390
- What do you mean by "1 of the 2?"
- What do you mean?

1291
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,530
- I just took a wild guess.
- One. Please show your answers.

1292
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,950
- Isn't it "apple?"
- It's "cake."

1293
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,260
- It's "cake."
- Oh, it's "cake."

1294
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,990
- It's either "pie" or "cake."
- "Pie."

1295
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,970
I wrote "cake,"
but changed it to "pie."

1296
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,800
- My answer is "soup."
- Mine is "apple."

1297
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,740
- "Cake?"
- My answer is "soup."

1298
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,340
- I wrote "soup" too.
- A piece of...

1299
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,140
- The answer is "cake."
- Right.

1300
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,570
- Isn't "pie" also correct?
- Okay.

1301
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,870
- Team Yang wins this time.
- Okay.

1302
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:21,970
(Team Yang wins.)

1303
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,820
- I wrote "cake," but changed it.
- The answer is "cake."

1304
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,910
I've never heard
that expression before.

1305
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,340
- I changed it to "pie."
- How did you know?

1306
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,320
- I lived overseas for ten years.
- I see.

1307
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,640
- For ten years?
- Yes.

1308
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,820
That's funny.
He said "ten years" in English.

1309
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,160
- Here goes the next question.
- Let's move on.

1310
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,890
(Mom's something disappears
and Dad's wrinkles are gone)

1311
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:35,890
- Mom's
- Mom's

1312
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,820
"Mom's something disappears
and Dad's wrinkles are gone."

1313
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,530
- Mom...
- Clap, clap

1314
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,300
- It's "clap, clap?"
- Clap, clap

1315
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,490
The lyrics are sad. Dad can smile
when Mom's something disappears.

1316
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,140
No. Can he?

1317
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,240
Mom Su Jung

1318
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,910
- Mom...
- Mom...

1319
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,640
- Mom...
- Mom...

1320
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,910
Mom...

1321
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,510
Clap, clap

1322
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,590
It's driving me crazy.

1323
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,590
- I got it.
- Did you figure it out?

1324
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,680
I got it.

1325
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,780
I'll give you a hint.
I'm not sure if it's right,

1326
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,780
but as Dad's wrinkles are gone,
Mom also...

1327
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,120
His wrinkles are gone
as his worries disappear.

1328
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,320
- Yes. In 1, 2, 3.
- Mom...

1329
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,590
(Mom's worry disappears
and Dad's wrinkles are gone.)

1330
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,470
In 1, 2, 3.

1331
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,970
Mom's worry...

1332
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,340
- Mom's sigh disappears
- I don't know.

1333
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,300
The correct answer is "sigh."

1334
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,680
Trainer Yoo's team earned one more.

1335
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,120
Right. It's "sigh."

1336
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,680
- I wrote "second child."
- Right.

1337
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,890
"Mom's chest disappears?"

1338
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,010
- "Chest."
- Who wrote it?

1339
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,260
Why did you write "chest?"

1340
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,220
- It's chest.
- Like heart.

1341
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,390
- It's the heart.
- The heart.

1342
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,620
- The heart.
- The chest.

1343
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,470
- Her heart disappears?
- Her heart disappears?

1344
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:50,640
I could've written it.

1345
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,970
Okay. We won.

1346
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:52,990
(The result of the battle among pure
fighters who listen to their hearts)

1347
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:55,110
- It's 4 to 4.
- Each team can punch 4 times.

1348
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,640
- Okay.
- We can win.

1349
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,180
You win
when you get the highest score.

1350
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,180
All right.

1351
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,700
Shall we begin?

1352
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,610
You guys go first.

1353
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,050
You win
when you get the highest score.

1354
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,120
- The highest score?
- Yes.

1355
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,220
Then it's good.

1356
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,320
- The highest score.
- The one with the highest score?

1357
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,950
Gosh.

1358
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,390
Look at Sung Hoon's fists.

1359
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,090
I must do this.

1360
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,590
- I must do this at least.
- You should make it.

1361
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,720
Doo Ho.

1362
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,990
Who wants to go first?

1363
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,570
- I'll go first as I'm the weakest.
- Okay.

1364
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,870
- Ssaebssaeb.
- Are we taking turns?

1365
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,760
- We'll take turns.
- Can you use both hands?

1366
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,800
I heard you can.

1367
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,260
- Okay.
- We're on the same team.

1368
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,410
Oh, we're on the same team.
I'm sorry.

1369
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,870
- We can use both hands, right?
- Yes, you can.

1370
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,070
Here I go.

1371
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,140
(He wasn't competitive
during the quiz.)

1372
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,140
Punch it hard.

1373
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,590
- Did you punch it?
- Yes, I did.

1374
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,240
The sound is gentle.

1375
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,510
- It's gentle.
- Why did you punch like that?

1376
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,890
No, it was strong.

1377
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,090
(How many points will he get?)

1378
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,120
- It's 8,100.
- That's good.

1379
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,930
- Seok Sam.
- I'll go.

1380
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:51,800
- It's about 8,100.
- Let me just win against him.

1381
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,620
- Only four of us will punch it.
- Okay.

1382
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,030
- He has no strength. He's weak.
- It's nice.

1383
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:57,740
Do you usually throw a hook
or a regular punch?

1384
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,070
Maybe straight?

1385
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,200
He looks weak.

1386
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,240
You were almost hit in your face.

1387
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,200
- I punched the side.
- Why were you scared?

1388
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,280
- I punched the side.
- It's okay...

1389
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,300
as only the highest score matters.

1390
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:10,640
- Okay. It's 7,443.
- It's 7,443.

1391
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,340
- Se Chan has the highest score.
- Is Jong Kook next?

1392
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,180
- Jong Kook.
- I'm not good.

1393
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,550
- It'd be better for me to do it.
- Jong Kook.

1394
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,260
- Look at him.
- The other team is...

1395
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,090
Like this?

1396
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,160
(His punches are strong as he
works out and boxes regularly.)

1397
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,990
- He's strong.
- With this waist.

1398
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:25,120
- Like this?
- Yes.

1399
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,390
(Will he be able
to set the highest record?)

1400
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:28,530
He's different.

1401
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,090
- He didn't punch it precisely.
- He kind of missed it.

1402
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,370
- He missed it.
- I missed it.

1403
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,530
- He missed it.
- It's fine.

1404
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,530
- I missed it.
- It's okay.

1405
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,340
- Okay.
- I missed it.

1406
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,140
It's lower than Se Chan's score.

1407
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,680
- Okay.
- I missed it.

1408
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,870
You need to punch it precisely.

1409
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,720
Only the highest score
matters anyway.

1410
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,620
But having a lower score
than Se Chan is a little...

1411
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,120
Exactly.

1412
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,120
Dong Hyun.

1413
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,450
- Stop.
- I mean...

1414
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,180
- Stop.
- Even if you missed it...

1415
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,260
- Gosh.
- What was the score?

1416
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,700
He plays soccer like this too.

1417
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,700
(This is my chance.)

1418
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,970
He got bad hands
as well as bad legs.

1419
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,620
When I box with someone, he's likely
to dodge it, so I punch accordingly.

1420
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,140
Here I go.

1421
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,490
(Trainer Yoo is the fourth one
to punch.)

1422
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:06,590
- He punched it well.
- He punched it precisely.

1423
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:08,640
- He punched it well.
- He punched it precisely.

1424
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:09,870
He punched the center.

1425
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,910
(He punched precisely.)

1426
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,070
- He punched it well.
- Let's see.

1427
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,700
- Let's go over it.
- It's near 8,000.

1428
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,910
It's 8,055.

1429
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,950
(Trainer Yang: 8,100
Trainer Yoo: 8,055)

1430
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,410
- It's 8,055.
- We won then.

1431
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:21,950
- Se Chan is in the first place.
- Gosh, Se Chan.

1432
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,390
I got golden fists.

1433
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,490
This is great.

1434
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,680
It's embarrassing to have
a lower score than Se Chan now.

1435
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,950
- Sung Hoon.
- Sung Hoon.

1436
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:30,490
Good luck. I'm curious.

1437
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,550
(The third player from Team Yang
is Sexyama.)

1438
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,070
Sung Hoon. Don't waste energy.

1439
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,470
(Shadowboxing)

1440
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,800
Sung Hoon. Don't waste energy.

1441
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,070
Your bracelet.

1442
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:43,660
(A gold bracelet!)

1443
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,740
It flew off.

1444
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,030
(Surprised)

1445
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,640
- I picked it up.
- No.

1446
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,740
- I picked it up.
- What's the matter?

1447
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,220
I picked it up.

1448
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,240
It's an expensive one.

1449
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,840
It's mine
once it falls onto the floor.

1450
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,180
Sung Hoon.

1451
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,410
- He's different.
- He often throws short punches.

1452
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,390
The way he's shadowboxing
is different.

1453
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,530
(How will Sexyama punch?)

1454
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,180
- Look. He went for a short punch.
- He threw a short punch.

1455
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,350
Sung Hoon, it's...

1456
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:15,950
- Look. He went for a short punch.
- He threw a short punch.

1457
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,010
What was it?

1458
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,450
- What was it?
- It might be lower than we think.

1459
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,570
- It's...
- Because he threw a short punch.

1460
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,740
It could be less than 8,000.

1461
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,120
What? Eight.

1462
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,320
- What?
- It's 7,700.

1463
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,010
(He's 3rd among them?)

1464
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,530
Se Chan is in the first place.

1465
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,720
- Follow me, Sung Hoon.
- Your score is lower than mine.

1466
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,660
- He punched it precisely though.
- It's weird.

1467
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,720
- What was it?
- What happened?

1468
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,700
- Should I retire?
- It's because it was a short punch.

1469
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,100
It was a short swing
as you usually throw short punches.

1470
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,260
That's why.
Because it was a short punch.

1471
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,930
(Compared to his fancy shadowboxing,
the result is devastating.)

1472
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,910
For your information,
Chan Sung will use his left hand...

1473
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,700
- I'll use my left hand.
- as his right hand is injured.

1474
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,970
- You should add 10 percent for him.
- You must score more than him.

1475
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,280
- Increase his score by ten percent.
- You must score more than him.

1476
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,570
I will win Se Chan.

1477
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,720
- Yes, you should.
- You will?

1478
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,070
It's weird to hear him
saying Se Chan's name.

1479
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,240
He's younger than me.

1480
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,640
- It made me proud of you.
- Yes.

1481
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,320
I know.

1482
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,220
(I will beat Se Chan
just with my left hand!)

1483
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,320
My left hand.

1484
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,620
- That's it.
- I think he kind of missed it.

1485
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,620
No.

1486
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,700
(Missing)

1487
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,620
- That's it.
- I think he kind of missed it.

1488
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,840
He punched the bottom.

1489
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,370
(What score will he have?)

1490
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,840
(Chan Sung: 5,697)

1491
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,840
Come on.

1492
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,800
(He's the last place.)

1493
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,240
- Come here.
- What?

1494
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,470
- This is good.
- What did he do?

1495
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,470
- We won.
- I got a higher score than him.

1496
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,510
- I got a higher score than him.
- We won.

1497
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,590
- What is...
- I beat Chan Sung.

1498
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,680
All right.

1499
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,490
- What's this?
- He won.

1500
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,590
All the great athletes...

1501
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:33,890
- can't even beat me.
- What was it?

1502
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,120
It's because I'm right-handed.

1503
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,490
What did you do?

1504
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:40,600
- He's Wreck-It Ralph.
- He's the punch king.

1505
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,600
Se Chan is the punch king.

1506
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,200
- What's this?
- This is all for Doo Ho.

1507
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,760
What are you doing?

1508
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,470
- Mr. Bong.
- Just with one punch.

1509
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:51,700
- Let's go, Bong.
- Each team got one player left now.

1510
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,350
- This is unbelievable.
- Each team got one chance.

1511
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,410
You know it, right?

1512
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:57,320
- Right.
- Sung Hoon and Chan Sung punched,

1513
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,050
- but I'm in 2nd place.
- I'm in 1st place.

1514
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,680
Punch the center.

1515
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,760
Do it.

1516
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,890
(The last player from Team Yang,
Cicada Kim is going.)

1517
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:05,950
Nice.

1518
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,820
- Nice.
- That's nice.

1519
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:16,840
- Bong.
- Kim Bong.

1520
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,010
He punched it well.

1521
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,140
(Superhuman strength)

1522
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,340
He punched it well.

1523
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,800
(Will he be able to beat
Trainer Yang, the punch king?)

1524
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,870
He punched it well.

1525
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,370
(Dong Hyun: 8,181)

1526
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,370
(Stun Gun became 1st place.)

1527
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,120
- It's okay. It's good.
- There's not much of a difference.

1528
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,550
- There's not much of a difference.
- It's not that different.

1529
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,180
How are athletes different from me?

1530
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,010
- What's this?
- The gap is 81 points.

1531
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:40,450
- Hey. You did it.
- Still, he has the highest score.

1532
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:41,990
- We got Doo Ho left.
- Doo Ho.

1533
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,220
- Show us.
- I got the hang of it.

1534
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,220
- He got the hang of it.
- Okay. You don't know.

1535
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,760
- He doesn't know anymore.
- He will miss it.

1536
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,760
It doesn't matter.

1537
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,530
Let's go.

1538
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:53,140
- Okay. You don't know.
- He doesn't know anymore.

1539
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,740
- He doesn't know anymore.
- He will miss it.

1540
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,740
He punched it precisely.

1541
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,840
He will miss it.

1542
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,740
He punched it precisely.

1543
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:00,780
He will miss it.

1544
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,280
(He punched it precisely!)

1545
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,410
- It's good.
- We won.

1546
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,140
- We won.
- We're good.

1547
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,320
He punched it well.

1548
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,490
- It must be 7,000.
- It's 8,600.

1549
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,090
(Doo Ho: 8,631)

1550
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:12,220
(Superboy became the final winner.)

1551
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,490
I want to do it again.

1552
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,780
I can do well if I do it again.

1553
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,430
Now, 8,631 is the score
of an athlete.

1554
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,700
You can't call yourself an athlete
with 8,100 points.

1555
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,220
- He's different.
- That was nice.

1556
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:26,800
- Thanks to Doo Ho, Team Yoo won.
- Yes!

1557
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,840
(Team Yoo won.)

1558
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,300
Let's do it again.

1559
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,870
- Let's do it one more time.
- We should do it twice.

1560
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,180
No. Get rid of the machine.

1561
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,870
We'll give the winning team
100 dollars...

1562
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:38,010
- and the losing team 50 dollars.
- Okay.

1563
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,590
- Gosh, why did I do that?
- Will the trainer distribute it?

1564
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,910
- Of course.
- You'll negotiate now.

1565
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:42,950
Negotiate?

1566
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,780
- Okay. Negotiation.
- It's time to negotiate now.

1567
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,820
- Do I get a raise?
- Of course.

1568
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,430
- Of course.
- This is so annoying.

1569
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:49,720
- Okay.
- It's a bummer.

1570
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,550
I'll explain
how to negotiate your salary.

1571
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:53,570
Okay.

1572
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:57,070
Each of you can enter the tent
and negotiate for two minutes.

1573
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:00,840
The trainer can offer their salary
within the budget you earned.

1574
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,780
The players will negotiate their
current trainer first.

1575
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,410
If they don't like the offer,
they can negotiate with the other one.

1576
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,370
If they can't make an agreement
with him either,

1577
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:11,180
the salary will be cut by half.

1578
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,070
- Looking at the table...
- It sounds good.

1579
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:14,320
(Trainer Yoo: 386,440
Trainer Yang: 435,720)

1580
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,590
I feel so good.

1581
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,720
- Suk Jin, come in.
- Yes.

1582
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,780
- Should I go first?
- Yes.

1583
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,780
Well...

1584
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,390
Hello.

1585
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,680
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

1586
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,930
- Take a seat.
- Okay. You know...

1587
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,470
How much are you thinking?

1588
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,800
(He goes straight to the point.)

1589
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,260
I'm not in a position to talk
about my salary elsewhere.

1590
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,640
How much are you thinking?

1591
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,740
(Original salary, 3 cents)

1592
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,450
About 20 dollars.

1593
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,100
That's way too high.

1594
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,180
You need to give me
at least 20 dollars.

1595
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,470
You need to consider our situation.

1596
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:48,010
That's not the point.
You have 400 dollars right now.

1597
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:51,090
You haven't even spent 10 dollars
on us yet.

1598
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,450
I've spent over 10 dollars.

1599
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:55,990
As you know, it's a competition
between me and Trainer Yang.

1600
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,700
You're being way too frugal.

1601
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,990
I'll keep it a secret and stay here.

1602
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,890
- No.
- Listen.

1603
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:05,100
Suk Jin.
You need to consider my situation.

1604
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,930
- Or I'm going to leave.
- I'll give you a 100 percent raise.

1605
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,640
(3 cent raise)

1606
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,680
The salary negotiation is...

1607
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,180
One hundred percent raise?

1608
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:16,640
If I was getting 10 dollars,
that would make sense,

1609
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,320
but I'm only getting 3 cents.

1610
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,050
I'll give you 30 cents.

1611
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,450
Wait. Okay.

1612
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,490
(In a rush)

1613
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:24,090
If you give me 50 cents,
I'll put up with it.

1614
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:28,280
I'm not asking
for 5 million dollars.

1615
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,320
Only 50 cents.

1616
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,350
Hey, the market price is so high,

1617
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,570
seolleongtang costs 12 dollars.

1618
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,890
Give me a dollar.

1619
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:39,370
I'll give you 50 cents. Sign here.

1620
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,470
(Angry)

1621
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,070
I can't sign it.

1622
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,850
My pride won't accept it.

1623
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,100
I asked for a dollar.

1624
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,970
- I said I'll give you 50 cents.
- A dollar.

1625
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,070
You said 50 cents
when I suggested 30 cents.

1626
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,180
- That was a mistake.
- You need to leave.

1627
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,590
That was a mistake.

1628
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:56,590
Get lost.

1629
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,850
"Get lost?"

1630
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,760
Hey.

1631
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,120
- A mistake?
- "Get lost?"

1632
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,160
Get lost.

1633
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,700
I'm very offended.

1634
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,350
- Get lost.
- Seriously.

1635
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,470
- Hey!
- Bye.

1636
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,430
- Bye.
- So long.

1637
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:10,430
- Get lost.
- Hey!

1638
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:11,890
Don't ever think
about seeing me again.

1639
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:13,160
- Get lost.
- Hey!

1640
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,430
It's cold. Close the door.

1641
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,200
- How much do you want?
- Me?

1642
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,870
Honestly, I don't care about money.
I'm here because I like you.

1643
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,010
You don't care about money?
So keep it the same?

1644
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,180
- No, don't do that.
- Okay.

1645
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,180
- There are people...
- Okay.

1646
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,070
who watch me.

1647
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,180
So how much do you want?

1648
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,490
Just to save my face,

1649
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:34,030
I want to get more
than the 10 cent range.

1650
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,930
You're in the one cent range.

1651
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,530
- You're in the one cent range.
- I know that.

1652
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,260
Give me at least a dollar.

1653
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,990
- That's ridiculous.
- That's ridiculous?

1654
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,930
Look. How many times is that?

1655
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:45,970
That's not the point.

1656
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,010
That's a 100 percent raise.

1657
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,200
I'm...

1658
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,010
(What?)

1659
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,470
- What did you just say?
- I didn't say that.

1660
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,550
- Mr. Haha.
- I never said that.

1661
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,280
No swearing.

1662
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,550
- That's not it.
- No dollar range.

1663
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,280
Look.
You're currently getting 3 cents.

1664
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,820
If I give you 30 cents,
how many times is that?

1665
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,680
I was worth more than 3 cents
at first.

1666
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,180
Look.

1667
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:11,100
Trainer Yoo won't give you
more than 50 cents.

1668
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,990
- I know that.
- Exactly.

1669
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,070
But I'll make it worth.

1670
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,740
Besides,
is that all that I mean to you?

1671
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,910
- Fine. I'll give you 50 cents.
- Fifty cents?

1672
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:25,030
That's still a big raise. 50 cents.

1673
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:28,470
Hey. It's me, Dong Hoon.

1674
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,870
Hey.

1675
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,850
Have you forgotten I'm Dong Hoon?

1676
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,180
That's not how it works.

1677
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,390
- That's not how it works.
- Se Chan.

1678
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,320
- Fine. 60 cents.
- Sixty cents.

1679
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,450
Sixty cents. It's time.

1680
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:43,990
Honestly...

1681
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:46,350
I'm telling you. If you do well,

1682
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:48,160
it'll increase by ten times.

1683
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,660
What's 10 times 60?

1684
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,660
- Six hundred.
- I'll give you 6 dollars.

1685
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,800
Can you write that in the contract?

1686
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,530
- Add that condition.
- No conditions are added.

1687
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,740
Just write you'll increase it
by ten times.

1688
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,030
I'm going to rip it.

1689
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,640
Sixty cents it is.

1690
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,370
You've become picky.

1691
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,370
"You?"

1692
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,180
Se Chan. Hold it.

1693
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,490
Hold it.

1694
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,140
Make a fist. One, two, three.

1695
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:14,050
Okay. Haha.
You must not tell anyone.

1696
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,450
Thank you.

1697
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,600
- Next.
- Se Chan.

1698
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,760
- Let's grab lunch later.
- Okay.

1699
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,660
How was it?

1700
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,570
Ji Hyo, you're next.

1701
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,570
(Trainer Yang)

1702
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,010
(Haha gossips as soon as he leaves.)

1703
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,660
He's a jerk.

1704
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,740
(Haha gossips as soon as he leaves.)

1705
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,240
My goodness.

1706
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,850
Chan Sung, come in.

1707
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,220
Chan Sung. Honestly,

1708
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,950
I was disappointed in your punch.

1709
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,490
What did you think of my acting?

1710
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,850
I knew Doo Ho was going to win.

1711
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:48,220
I'm starting to learn
how to make the show funny.

1712
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,260
- So?
- I knew Doo Ho had to win...

1713
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,450
to make the show funny.

1714
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:55,370
- You did that on purpose?
- You think...

1715
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:58,570
You think I'd miss that
after two title matches?

1716
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,660
That was done on purpose.

1717
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,470
I'm sorry,
but all I can give you is eight dollars.

1718
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:04,930
Only eight dollars?

1719
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,070
I don't mind. It's fine.

1720
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,370
I said I'll be loyal
as long as you give me food.

1721
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:10,450
- You're okay?
- I'm loyal.

1722
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,120
Okay, eight dollars it is.
The salary negotiation is so easy.

1723
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,090
- Can you give me 50 cents more?
- Fifty cents?

1724
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,090
A meal costs 8.5 dollars these days.

1725
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:20,490
- Eight dollars and fifty cents.
- I'm...

1726
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:25,050
He doesn't mind
even though it's reduced.

1727
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,160
I'm loyal. I...

1728
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,970
It's six dollars right now.

1729
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:30,600
- What?
- I was getting six dollars.

1730
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,430
- Ten.
- I was getting ten dollars?

1731
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:34,010
It's ten dollars?

1732
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,160
- I thought it was six dollars.
- No, sign it.

1733
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,600
- It went up.
- Wait a minute.

1734
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,180
- It went up, right?
- It went up.

1735
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,640
Yes. Sign it.

1736
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,640
Hold on.

1737
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,450
- Sign it.
- Did it go up?

1738
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,070
- Sign it first.
- Did it go down?

1739
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:47,550
Sign it first.

1740
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:48,910
(Trainer Yoo pressures him.)

1741
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,780
- I'm still loyal.
- I'm sorry.

1742
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,260
Exactly. Okay. Good.

1743
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,090
- Do your best, Chan Sung.
- I'll always be loyal.

1744
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,490
- Salute.
- Show me this time.

1745
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:57,950
- I'll show you.
- You may leave now.

1746
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,700
Okay. Good.

1747
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,120
This is...

1748
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,070
Good. Doo Ho.

1749
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,970
- Did you sign it?
- How much did he offer you?

1750
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,100
- How much are you getting?
- Eight dollars and fifty cents.

1751
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,140
What? 8.5 dollars for this big star?

1752
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:14,010
Doo Ho. I liked...

1753
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,010
your performance.

1754
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,570
I got you 100 dollars.

1755
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:20,550
How much do you want?

1756
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,990
To be honest,

1757
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,680
you should give me 40 dollars.

1758
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:26,950
(Disapproving)

1759
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,450
Because I got you 100 dollars.

1760
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:29,990
You're...

1761
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,660
asking for 40 percent
of what we have.

1762
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,430
That's too much.

1763
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:38,930
But think about it.
I got you 100 dollars.

1764
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:43,070
Didn't you say...

1765
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,030
you started after Chan Sung?

1766
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:49,140
That's another issue.
You saw his punch earlier.

1767
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:55,010
I believe a pro player should get paid
for his performance.

1768
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:59,010
Chan Sung recorded a terrible score,
to be honest.

1769
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,950
(How much does Trainer Yoo offer?)

1770
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:01,950
Ten dollars.

1771
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,820
Hang on.

1772
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,320
- Trainer Yoo.
- Yes.

1773
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,350
(That's far below
what Doo Ho wants.)

1774
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:09,530
You first offered 10 dollars
to Chan Sung.

1775
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:12,070
Yet I get the same offer
after what I did?

1776
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:15,300
You're currently
getting 3.5 dollars.

59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,900
Okay, then. You're stubborn.

1777
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,970
- You're no ordinary.
- I got you 100 dollars.

1778
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:24,220
I'll give you 15 dollars.

1779
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,740
That's the max amount
I can give you.

1780
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,990
- Okay.
- Okay.

1781
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,490
- I think...
- It's enough.

1782
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,180
That's more than enough.

1783
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:33,490
- Okay.
- I'll do my best.

1784
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:34,890
Good.

1785
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:37,490
- This isn't good.
- Because we're too naive,

1786
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:38,490
we signed it too easily.

1787
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,930
That's what agents are for.

1788
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,660
I had no choice.
If I don't get enough here,

1789
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,760
he'll only offer a lower salary.

1790
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,800
Right?

1791
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,660
- You've seen what I'm capable of.
- Yes.

1792
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,970
Bong. Let me tell you this.

1793
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,280
You've done
the salary negotiation before.

1794
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,370
No.

1795
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:54,850
- No? But you're an athlete.
- No.

1796
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,070
Oh, you had an agent.

1797
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,120
No, I just get what they give me.

1798
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,470
Then keep your mouth shut
and get what I'm giving you.

1799
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,390
No. Wait.

1800
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:05,390
You have to be at Chan Sung's level
to negotiate with UFC.

1801
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,120
- Okay.
- Or you'll get fired.

1802
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,550
- Okay.
- I just got what they gave me.

1803
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:09,990
- I'll listen.
- Listen.

1804
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,430
I don't know what's next,

1805
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:16,470
- but let me tell you a secret.
- A secret.

1806
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:20,070
We have four players here.

1807
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,260
Jung Chan Sung. He has...

1808
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,660
- a bad shoulder.
- He's injured.

1809
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,200
Choo Sung Hoon. He has a bad thigh.
He injured his knee.

1810
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,780
Choi Doo Ho? He's playing safe
because he has a match coming up.

1811
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:31,680
I have no matches.
I'm not injured. I'm healthy.

1812
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:33,370
I'm in perfect condition.

1813
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,780
Look here.

1814
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,320
Even if you make a good negotiation,

1815
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,850
if the player can't play
due to injuries,

1816
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:41,280
- that's a team owner's skill.
- That's a skill.

1817
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,280
You paid a lot,
but the player can't play.

1818
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,600
That's a secret.

1819
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,300
Okay. So how much do you want?

1820
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,620
I want 100 dollars.

1821
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,890
I almost cursed.

1822
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:50,530
- What did you say?
- One hundred.

1823
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:52,200
- I'll lead the team.
- How much?

1824
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,570
I'll lead the team.
Give me 100 dollars.

1825
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,470
I'm sorry, but the door is that way.

1826
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,970
- Give me 100 dollars.
- Not a chance.

1827
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:00,370
I didn't have a chance to show you.
Let me show you now.

1828
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:03,350
You were only 81 points higher
than me.

1829
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,640
- What?
- You were only 81 points higher.

1830
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,280
Look. What are you doing?

1831
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,490
What are you doing?

1832
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:13,780
(Armed protest)

1833
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:17,320
What are you doing?

1834
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,990
See that?

1835
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,070
- See that?
- What are you doing?

1836
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:24,160
- You're scaring me.
- Did you see that?

1837
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,530
- You broke the chair.
- What's wrong with the chair?

1838
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:28,760
Okay. I get it.

1839
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,930
Tell me again. How much?

1840
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,030
Wait.

1841
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,680
Why is the chair broken?

1842
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,680
- Dong Hyun. Listen.
- Sorry.

1843
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,370
- I was only trying to show you.
- One hundred is too much.

1844
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:37,850
- Listen to me first.
- I don't hold grudges.

1845
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:39,550
How much did you get earlier?

1846
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:41,180
- I was getting 4.3 dollars.
- You were getting 4 dollars.

1847
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,780
I'll increase it by ten times.

1848
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,990
- Forty dollars?
- Yes, that's still ten times more.

1849
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:47,180
That's ten times.

1850
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,760
You haven't seen my kick yet.

1851
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,890
Kick?

1852
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:53,800
- Watch my kick.
- Okay.

1853
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,820
- I have a good kick.
- Sit down.

1854
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,430
- Okay.
- Let me show you my knee kick.

1855
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:58,840
Okay. I get it.

1856
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,260
- Knee kick?
- Okay.

1857
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,470
- All right.
- Okay.

1858
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:03,300
- All right.
- I can show you.

1859
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,570
I'm giving up on Sung Hoon.

1860
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:06,700
- I like to keep it neat.
- Sixty dollars.

1861
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,280
- Sixty dollars?
- No more. Look.

1862
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,850
Look.

1863
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,850
Even if you go over there,
he won't give you 60 dollars.

1864
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,620
I need to get paid the highest
among the players.

1865
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,180
UFC...

1866
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,680
paid me only a little. I was so sad.

1867
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,890
Sixty dollars is the highest price.

1868
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:23,930
- What if it's not?
- Then come back to me.

1869
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:25,720
- Really?
- How much would he offer you?

1870
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:28,160
- I don't know.
- He'd never offer that much.

1871
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,530
Not even a chance.

1872
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:33,340
I gave him a dollar
and gave Haha 60 cents.

1873
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:35,260
I'll come back.

1874
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:37,160
- I will leave it here.
- Okay.

1875
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,200
(He tries to negotiate his salary
as he couldn't do it at the UFC.)

1876
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,340
- Come on in.
- So Min.

1877
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,300
I haven't signed the contract yet.

1878
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,370
- Is the negotiation underway?
- Yes.

1879
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:44,780
Over there,

1880
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,620
he pushed the contract toward me
and insisted that I sign it.

1881
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,390
How much are you thinking?

1882
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:53,260
I am thinking about 100 dollars.

1883
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:56,680
About 100 dollars.

1884
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,120
Over there,
I was offered a similar amount.

1885
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:01,990
I am serious.

1886
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:03,430
- I am terribly sorry,
- Okay.

1887
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:04,800
- but the door is that way.
- Come on.

1888
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,700
- In that case,
- If you ask for 100 dollars...

1889
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,140
- please put this down for a second.
- Okay.

1890
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,510
- Please put this down.
- Why?

1891
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:11,910
- I showed him my punch.
- Okay.

1892
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:13,700
That will help in negotiating
the salary.

1893
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,680
- We don't know what we will do.
- No.

1894
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,910
Here.

1895
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:18,120
- My goodness.
- This is how I throw punches.

1896
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:20,680
- My goodness.
- This is how I throw punches.

1897
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,410
This is how I throw punches.

1898
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:24,990
I can't believe you.

1899
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,620
- This is a knee strike.
- Hold on.

1900
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,220
- It knocks out a person.
- Hold on. Okay.

1901
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,680
Okay. I got it.

1902
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,950
I got it.

1903
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:32,930
Why... Kim Bong.

1904
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:33,990
Hold on.

1905
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,820
- Kim Bong.
- This is how I attack.

1906
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,600
Did you see that?

1907
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,990
Why did you do that here?

1908
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,240
- Do you want to see more?
- No, I have seen enough.

1909
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,280
I can pick this up and hit people.

1910
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,510
Don't do that. I got it.

1911
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,930
- I got it.
- Don't you want to see that?

1912
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:48,680
- Kim Bong, I understood.
- Okay.

1913
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,970
Kim Bong, firstly...

1914
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,950
- I didn't mean to make a scene.
- All right.

1915
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:55,320
I can see
what kind of a fighter you are...

1916
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,390
from your behaviors.

1917
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:59,390
- I am a passionate fighter.
- Hold on.

1918
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,450
This is my offer.

1919
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:02,450
(How much did Trainer Yoo offer?)

1920
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:03,720
I signed the contract too.

1921
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,530
I will tell you...

1922
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,490
- how much he offered.
- Ten dollars.

1923
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,120
- I will go back.
- Ten dollars.

1924
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,620
Ten dollars.

1925
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,070
- Over there...
- Do you want half of that?

1926
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,340
- I will be honest with you.
- Go ahead.

1927
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,470
He offered 60 dollars.

1928
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:18,410
- There is no way.
- He offered 60 dollars.

1929
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:20,070
There is no way
Trainer Yang offered that much.

1930
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,470
- When I showed him this trick...
- Ten dollars.

1931
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:24,120
- He offered 5 or 7 dollars...
- My offer is 10 dollars.

1932
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,470
at first.

1933
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:26,470
When I punched this,

1934
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:27,720
- the price rose to 60 dollars.
- My offer is 10 dollars.

1935
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,010
- Give me 60 dollars.
- This should be enough.

1936
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:30,680
- Why did I come here then?
- Listen.

1937
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,180
I will give you 12 dollars.

1938
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,260
I will leave then.

1939
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:36,820
Won't you regret this decision?
We don't know what we will do,

1940
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:39,300
- but only I am able-bodied.
- I will give you 12 dollars.

1941
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:41,760
Okay? I will leave then.

1942
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,890
I will give you 12 dollars.

1943
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:44,840
Are you looking down
on my monstrous power?

1944
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,530
- Give me 30 dollars.
- My offer is 12 dollars.

1945
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:48,430
- Seriously, I will leave.
- I can't give you more.

1946
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,240
Hey, you are totally ruined.

1947
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,510
(Laughing)

1948
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,510
I can't give you more.

1949
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:56,740
- Then I will leave.
- I can't give you more.

1950
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,870
Leave.

1951
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:02,550
- I will see if you do well.
- Leave.

1952
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,410
You heard that, right?
He offered 12 dollars.

1953
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:06,780
- Isn't it annoying?
- Twelve dollars?

1954
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:08,430
- Isn't it annoying?
- He offered me less money.

1955
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,720
- It's annoying.
- Did he really offer 12 dollars?

1956
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,050
- You are still in the industry.
- This won't do.

1957
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,890
You shouldn't get less money
than a retired comedian.

1958
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:16,570
He offered me ten dollars.

1959
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,490
- How did he offer him 12 dollars?
- He offered Dong Hyun 12 dollars.

1960
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:19,530
This is wrong.

1961
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:21,800
- I feel like I got conned.
- It seems that way.

1962
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,340
Go in there and ask him
to rip up the contract.

1963
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,680
Then you should talk one more time.

1964
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,510
He rushed me into signing
the contract.

1965
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:28,510
I got scared.

1966
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,350
I will ask Trainer Yang...

1967
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,220
if he is willing to pay the penalty.

1968
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,550
That's a good idea.

1969
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:35,390
- And how much he can pay.
- That's a great idea.

1970
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,510
- How much are you thinking?
- If I get this deal,

1971
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:38,760
would you give me a dollar?

1972
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,660
- I will give you 50 cents.
- You will give me 50 cents.

1973
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:43,590
- How much did you get?
- I can't believe you.

1974
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:44,800
My goodness.

1975
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:46,720
I will go with him.

1976
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,970
- You can divide up a dollar.
- That won't do.

1977
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:51,140
- Give us three dollars.
- Come on.

1978
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:52,430
I will give you...

1979
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:53,640
- ten percent of what I get.
- Ten percent.

1980
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,140
- Okay.
- Let's get him some money.

1981
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,870
It isn't 10 percent per person.
It's 10 percent for the both of you.

1982
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:58,840
- He is a businessman.
- The both of us.

1983
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:01,350
It will still be more
than our salary.

1984
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,410
Next.

1985
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:05,140
- Sung Hoon, come on in.
- I heard stories about Trainer Yoo.

1986
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,620
Trainer Yang isn't half bad.

1987
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,510
He is nice. He is reasonable.

1988
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,550
- What are you doing? Hold on.
- Good.

1989
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:12,760
- What are you doing? Hold on.
- Good.

1990
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,590
- Hold on.
- Hey.

1991
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,280
- What?
- Hold on.

1992
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,320
Hey, go ahead.

1993
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,490
- Hold on.
- What?

1994
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:21,870
- You aren't here as a loan shark.
- Come on.

1995
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:23,430
- Let's go.
- I am a trainer.

1996
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,840
- What are you going to do?
- Hold on.

1997
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:28,430
- Sit down.
- My goodness.

1998
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:30,600
- This is a negotiation. Sung Hoon.
- I know.

1999
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,340
Let's talk well.

2000
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,410
- Let's talk well.
- Exactly.

2001
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:36,280
- Listen carefully.
- Okay.

2002
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,240
You know that your punch was...

2003
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:39,740
very weak, right?

2004
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:41,850
- It was very weak.
- But...

2005
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:43,240
I will be honest.

2006
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,660
For how many years
did you star in variety shows?

2007
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,680
- Many years.
- Many years.

2008
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,780
It isn't fun
if you do well from the start.

2009
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:53,160
- You need to start out weak.
- There should be a buildup.

2010
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,720
I was trying to create a story.

2011
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,220
Why don't you know that?

2012
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,260
- There should be a buildup.
- Exactly.

2013
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,840
How much will you give me?

2014
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:02,160
How much are you thinking?

2015
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,930
I think I deserve 50 dollars.

2016
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,200
- What?
- I said 50 dollars.

2017
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,010
- Do you want 50 dollars from me?
- That's right.

2018
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:09,410
Exactly 50 dollars.

2019
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,410
I can't.
I don't think I can do that.

2020
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,220
Fifty dollars.

2021
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,120
Who are you talking to?

2022
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,010
- Listen.
- Okay.

2023
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,090
I will give you the highest salary
in the team.

2024
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,780
- Okay?
- How much is that?

2025
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,930
- I will give you 15 dollars.
- Come on.

2026
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:24,120
(Come on.)

2027
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,390
Come on.

2028
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,720
You are looking down on me.

2029
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,760
- Looking down on you? No way.
- You are looking down on me.

2030
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:31,890
I offered you a lot of money.

2031
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,770
If you go over there,
Jae Suk won't offer much money.

2032
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:35,510
- Okay. Let's do this then.
- What?

2033
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:37,010
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors?

2034
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:38,200
Yes. Rock-paper-scissors.

2035
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,570
- If I win, give me 40 dollars.
- I will give you 30 dollars.

2036
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,070
Forty dollars.

2037
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,940
- What if you lose?
- If I lose...

2038
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,270
It should be less than 40 dollars,
so give me 30 dollars.

2039
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:50,520
What are you, a thug? Sung Hoon.

2040
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:53,410
You are behaving like a thug.

2041
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:54,760
It makes no sense.

2042
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,930
- Why? It makes sense.
- Listen.

2043
01:08:56,930 --> 01:09:00,430
No, it doesn't make sense.
I offered 20 dollars.

2044
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:02,690
- But you want 30 dollars.
- If I win, it's 40 dollars.

2045
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,120
If you win, it's 30 dollars.

2046
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,770
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
Okay.

2047
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,730
Be manly. Okay.

2048
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,610
- Okay.
- There you go. Good.

2049
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:10,610
Okay!

2050
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:13,030
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2051
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:14,110
Okay.

2052
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:16,070
(Trainer Yang won.)

2053
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,240
Thirty dollars.

2054
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,610
(My goodness.)

2055
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:20,870
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

2056
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:21,910
Okay.

2057
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:23,610
Did they play rock-paper-scissors?

2058
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:24,980
- Hey.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2059
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:28,260
- Who makes a deal that way?
- Even rock-paper-scissors?

2060
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,390
- You are the man.
- For goodness' sake.

2061
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,690
Good.

2062
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:33,800
- It can't be helped.
- It can't be helped.

2063
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:34,990
You are the man.

2064
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

2065
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,770
Pose for a photo. One, two, three.

2066
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:40,100
(Sung Hoon signed the contract
at 30 dollars.)

2067
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,700
- Okay. Thank you.
- All right.

2068
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,610
I will give you more next time.

2069
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:44,980
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

2070
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,310
Trainer Yang,

2071
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,150
I have big news.

2072
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,070
I will bring Doo Ho and Chan Sung.

2073
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:51,940
- They signed the contract.
- Firstly...

2074
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,850
- But they got conned.
- I see.

2075
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:54,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

2076
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:57,190
- Okay. I got it.
- Did you give him 30 dollars?

2077
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:59,590
The two underlings should leave.

2078
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:00,910
Underlings?

2079
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:03,020
- We are their agents.
- Agents? Tell me what happened.

2080
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,150
Trainer Yoo insisted
that I sign the contract.

2081
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:08,620
He scared me,
so I ended up signing it.

2082
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,990
They didn't know about their worth.

2083
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,560
Chan Sung signed the contract
for 22 dollars...

2084
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,030
and Doo Ho signed the contract
for 35 dollars.

2085
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:18,370
- They deserve more.
- They deserve more.

2086
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:19,900
- Did you say 35 dollars?
- Let me ask you this.

2087
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:22,400
Had I come to you first,
how much would you have offered?

2088
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,370
- If you had come to me first...
- Let's say I was a free fighter.

2089
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,610
Then I would have started
with an offer of 50 dollars.

2090
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:26,940
- Fifty dollars or more?
- Of course.

2091
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:27,980
How about Chan Sung?

2092
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,980
I would have started
with an offer of 50 dollars.

2093
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,450
You would have offered 50 dollars.

2094
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:32,860
- Of course.
- After a conversation,

2095
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,820
- it could have been 70 dollars.
- Or 60 dollars.

2096
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,820
Doo Ho, you seem very angry.

2097
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:37,990
- I...
- He is very angry.

2098
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:41,770
- Trainer Yoo offered me ten dollars.
- Do this.

2099
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,690
Doo Ho and Chan Sung, what's wrong?

2100
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,140
Listen.

2101
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,270
Earlier, you rushed me...

2102
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,270
into signing the contract.

2103
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:51,270
I am disappointed.

2104
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,640
Don't be disappointed.

2105
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:53,900
There is no need to worry.

2106
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,940
Once the team wins,
I will give you...

2107
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,240
I fell for this trick
at the age of 23.

2108
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:02,190
- I am 37 years old now.
- Come on.

2109
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:03,520
I didn't know
that I would fall for it again.

2110
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,450
Chan Sung, you don't need to worry.

2111
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:09,390
- I see why you rushed me...
- Listen.

2112
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,120
- into signing the contract.
- Come on.

2113
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:12,400
You must be upset...

2114
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,060
because Trainer Yang
must have offered much more.

2115
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,230
I pretended to be a free fighter
and asked him.

2116
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,470
He offered 50 dollars right away.

2117
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,340
- Really?
- Fifty dollars.

2118
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,060
After all, Doo Ho earned the team
100 dollars.

2119
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,140
My goodness.

2120
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:29,610
- You are open-minded.
- Seriously.

2121
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:30,900
- Of course, I am.
- You don't disappoint.

2122
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:34,270
- We can communicate well.
- Here, okay.

2123
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,390
- Let's work hard now.
- Hey.

2124
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,450
- Would you give me 20 cents?
- Chan Sung.

2125
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:40,110
Trainer Yoo.

2126
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,230
(Jung Chan Sung)

2127
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,650
Okay. I saved your pride.

2128
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,560
- Are you happy?
- I am very happy.

2129
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,400
- Do your best.
- This is a nice amount.

2130
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:48,820
- This is great.
- Do your best, okay?

2131
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:51,270
I will work hard.

2132
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,640
- You can go now.
- Okay.

2133
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,900
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2134
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:55,440
This is incredible.

2135
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,360
- How much did you offer earlier?
- But you rejected me.

2136
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,570
Here is the thing with me.

2137
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:03,400
My mind is quite fickle.

2138
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,020
I don't like people
who are calculative.

2139
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,220
- I am not calculative. I hate that.
- Earlier...

2140
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,780
- I offered 60 dollars.
- Yes.

2141
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,390
Now,

2142
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,260
- my new offer is 20 dollars.
- Come on. Make it 50 dollars.

2143
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:16,690
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2144
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:18,100
If I win, give me 50 dollars.
If I lose, give me 20 dollars.

2145
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,150
Let's play Subtract One.

2146
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:20,690
- Rock-paper-scissors. Subtract one.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2147
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:21,770
Okay.

2148
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,120
(Dong Hyun lost.)

2149
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,320
Go and talk to Trainer Yoo.

2150
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:25,730
Trainer Yoo.

2151
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,190
He is so stubborn.

2152
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,970
Are you done?

2153
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,660
- Do you need to talk to me?
- Are you going back and forth?

2154
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,680
- I am not going back and forth.
- Come here.

2155
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:34,810
I am surrounded by enemies.

2156
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,610
That man won't do.

2157
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:38,070
He has a rotten personality.

2158
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,350
How much can you give me?

2159
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:42,280
I will give you 15 dollars.

2160
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,780
You only raised two dollars.

2161
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,110
Then I will go there.

2162
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:47,480
- Go.
- Won't you regret it?

2163
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:49,430
I can't give you more.

2164
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,730
Sign the contract if you want.

2165
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:53,360
It's up to you.

2166
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:55,270
How can you give me 12 dollars?

2167
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,320
- This is wrong.
- No. I can't give you more.

2168
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,730
This is wrong.

2169
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,100
(Dong Hyun got driven out again.)

2170
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,530
- I will give you 16 dollars.
- Did you say 16 dollars?

2171
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:04,140
It's a considerable sum.

2172
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,110
I shouldn't have moved.

2173
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,480
Seriously. Hurry up and sign it.

2174
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,070
Good.

2175
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,570
All right.

2176
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:13,870
- They shook hands.
- Did they shake hands?

2177
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:15,050
- Okay.
- Did they shake hands?

2178
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:16,220
- What?
- Did he join the team?

2179
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,650
- Did Dong Hyun join that team?
- I had no choice.

2180
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:19,060
- Hey.
- How much did he get?

2181
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,110
I recruited him.

2182
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:21,590
- Did you recruit him?
- Yes.

2183
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:23,020
You were too haughty
in the beginning.

2184
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,760
That's not true.
He suddenly lowered...

2185
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,150
- the offer.
- Stop it.

2186
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:27,990
- You joined the team. Stop talking.
- You are out.

2187
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:29,060
- It's over.
- He offered...

2188
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,360
- twelve dollars.
- Stop it already.

2189
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,600
- You joined the team. Stop it.
- Just you watch.

2190
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,840
- Dong Hyun, why did you leave?
- He offered 12 dollars.

2191
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,840
Trainer Yang offered me
60 dollars in the beginning.

2192
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:37,940
Did you say 60 dollars?

2193
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:39,700
- Yes.
- Why did you say no to 60 dollars?

2194
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:41,610
You shouldn't have said no.

2195
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:43,650
- Why did you say no to 60 dollars?
- I didn't know anything...

2196
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:44,870
about the market price.

2197
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,680
- That was a nice offer.
- My goodness.

2198
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,980
- Sixty dollars.
- That was a nice offer.

2199
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,650
- I had no idea.
- It was the best offer.

2200
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:51,310
This is incredible.

2201
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:53,090
- What's this?
- It's a ring.

2202
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:55,230
- It's a ring.
- Did you make this?

2203
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,520
- Was it made for us?
- It's scary.

2204
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,950
- Really? Wasn't it here before?
- I...

2205
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:01,230
Why did you make such a fancy set?

2206
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:03,060
- I am Jeonchimawa Lee.
- Are we having a fistfight?

2207
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:04,770
He is my friend, Hatbari.

2208
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:05,990
Enter the ring.

2209
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:07,060
- What's wrong with you?
- Hatbari.

2210
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:08,810
- Get ready to fight me.
- Secquiao.

2211
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:11,010
- Secquiao.
- You little Secquiao.

2212
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:13,940
The other team has more fighters.

2213
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:15,550
It's too bad.

2214
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,700
(Team Trainer Yoo hurriedly recruits
Sung Hoon!)

2215
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,740
This is good.

2216
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:20,610
I will now explain the rules.

2217
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:22,890
Without knowing
the other team's order of players,

2218
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,950
you will send out a player.

2219
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:27,260
- We won't know it.
- Then the Name Tag Elimination...

2220
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:28,590
will take place.

2221
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:32,620
The next pair of players will enter
the ring after 60 seconds.

2222
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:33,650
(Whether they are eliminated or not
doesn't matter.)

2223
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:36,860
- What?
- The last surviving team will win.

2224
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:40,440
The winning team
will receive more money.

2225
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,310
- It's like the Royal Rumble.
- I see.

2226
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:43,610
It's like the Royal Rumble.

2227
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:45,110
(The rules are similar
to those of the Royal Rumble.)

2228
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:47,310
Five players will enter
from that team, right?

2229
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,700
- It will be 5 versus 5.
- No, 6 players will enter.

2230
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,240
One of your players can enter again.

2231
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,720
- Can it be anyone?
- Again? Can it be anyone?

2232
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,050
- That's great.
- Okay.

2233
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:55,980
- One of us can go again.
- It can be anyone.

2234
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:58,310
- One of us.
- Either you or I should go again.

2235
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,560
That's right.

2236
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,730
- We have a chance.
- We are set.

2237
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,950
- We are set.
- We will win.

2238
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:06,260
- We are set.
- Dong Hyun or you should go first.

2239
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,430
- That's right.
- They should go first.

2240
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:08,800
That's right.

2241
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,690
- I will go after Dong Hyun.
- Chan Sung.

2242
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:13,030
- His right shoulder is not good.
- You can go again afterward.

2243
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:15,510
- Dong Hyun will go first.
- We need a strategy.

2244
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:19,200
Shall I go first and hold out
instead of going for his name tag?

2245
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,840
- Hold out.
- Okay.

2246
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:24,850
Dong Hyun isn't our only problem.

2247
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:26,550
- There is Jong Kook too.
- That's right.

2248
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:28,410
- He has the know-how.
- Yes.

2249
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:30,190
- Seriously.
- He is experienced.

2250
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:31,280
- He has strength.
- And...

2251
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,730
he is full of energy right now
because he is excited.

2252
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:35,860
It's a sport.

2253
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:38,820
It's a sport with people
who have black belts.

2254
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,360
Yes. You have black belts.

2255
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,360
(Only the strong ones will survive.)

2256
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,900
Let's do a cheer.

2257
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2258
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,140
I am nervous.

2259
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,230
I am the most confident.

2260
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,030
The year 2023.

2261
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,640
Running Man.

2262
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,850
The Salary Fighter Race.

2263
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,680
Now comes the last mission...

2264
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,240
that will be the highlight
of Sunday evening.

2265
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,650
The one who rips off the name tag
will rule the ring.

2266
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:09,860
Running Rumble!

2267
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:13,260
(Team Trainer Yoo
versus Team Trainer Yang)

2268
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:17,190
Fighting out of the red corner
is the Stun Gun.

2269
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:19,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2270
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,660
(Stun Gun, Kim Dong Hyun)

2271
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,060
I knew he would go first.

2272
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,680
Hold out.

2273
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,840
I wonder how it will go.

2274
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:31,720
Fighting out of the blue corner
is the Korean Superboy,

2275
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,550
- Choi Doo Ho.
- Hold on.

2276
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:36,020
- Isn't this too early?
- Hold on.

2277
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:37,480
- I don't know who will win.
- Let's go.

2278
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:39,650
(A big match came to be
on Running Man.)

2279
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:40,890
This is incredible.

2280
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:45,520
(Superboy versus Stun Gun,
what will be the result?)

2281
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,930
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2282
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,190
- This is incredible.
- Are we starting right away?

2283
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,320
Come on.

2284
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,770
(Trying to intimidate)

2285
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:52,770
I can't predict the result.

2286
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:55,970
- Dong Hyun, let's go.
- Are we starting right away?

2287
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,530
Come on.

2288
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,730
Come on. Are you running away?

2289
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:01,340
Are you running away?

2290
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:07,570
There you go. That's good.

2291
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:08,810
It will be hard
to take off the name tag.

2292
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:10,240
They are
in different weight classes.

2293
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:14,360
(Doo Ho's both hands are caught.)

2294
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:17,760
(He manages to escape.)

2295
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,800
This is insane.

2296
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,060
(Dong Hyun continues
to charge forward.)

2297
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,930
- Dong Hyun, go for it.
- Go for it.

2298
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,400
(But Doo Ho buys time.)

2299
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,530
Okay.

2300
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:28,360
- Dong Hyun is bigger.
- Oh, no.

2301
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,400
I know.

2302
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,870
Dong Hyun needs to do better.

2303
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:33,730
Finish him off.

2304
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:34,770
(At that moment)

2305
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:36,200
Finish him off.

2306
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,810
(He grabbed the name tag!)

2307
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,690
It's okay. Grab him too.

2308
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:45,780
(Doo Ho twists his arm
and holds out!)

2309
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:48,890
Finish him off.

2310
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,690
- It's okay, Doo Ho.
- Go behind him.

2311
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:52,690
- Go behind him.
- No. It will be over...

2312
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:53,690
if Dong Hyun takes off his name tag.

2313
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:57,930
(It's a touch-and-go situation.)

2314
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:00,770
Now, the second pair of players
will enter the ring.

2315
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:03,110
Fighting out of the red corner
is Kim Protein.

2316
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:05,110
- Do we just enter the ring?
- Fighting out of the blue corner...

2317
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:06,440
is Sexyama,

2318
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,850
- Choo Sung Hoon.
- Hurry up.

2319
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,570
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

2320
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:11,650
- Okay.
- Sung Hoon.

2321
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,220
What's going on?

2322
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,740
- This is good.
- If this goes on...

2323
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:16,810
At this rate...

2324
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:19,190
- Okay.
- Hold on.

2325
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,860
- Hey.
- No.

2326
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:23,430
This is the real deal.

2327
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:25,150
Sung Hoon, hold out.

2328
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,270
(Their clasped hands show
that they refuse to yield.)

2329
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,190
They are so competitive.

2330
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:32,030
(It's a showdown.)

2331
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:34,770
Don't get caught.

2332
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:35,770
(At that moment,)

2333
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:37,160
(Sung Hoon is out.)

2334
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,230
- Okay.
- Okay.

2335
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:40,610
- Okay. I ripped it off.
- He got Jong Kook.

2336
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:42,270
- Don't get caught.
- Okay.

2337
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:43,440
(When Jong Kook was distracted,)

2338
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,370
(Superboy ripped off his name tag.)

2339
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:46,610
He got Jong Kook.

2340
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:47,980
- Did you rip it off?
- Jong Kook is out.

2341
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:49,390
Did Jong Kook get
his name tag ripped off?

2342
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:50,690
(Sung Hoon and Jong Kook
got eliminated in 15 seconds.)

2343
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:52,520
Thank goodness Jong Kook is out.

2344
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,910
- Totally.
- Thank goodness.

2345
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:56,760
Now comes the next pair of players.

2346
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,730
Fighting out of the red corner...

2347
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:02,160
is the Puke Tornado, Ji Suk Jin.

2348
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,160
(The eye of the hurricane,
Puke Tornado)

2349
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:07,900
Contending against him is
the Korean Zombie, Jung Chan Sung.

2350
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:12,070
- Go in there.
- The Korean Zombie, Jung Chan Sung.

2351
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,230
Hold on.

2352
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:15,770
(It's Suk Jin versus Chan Sung,
so the balance of power is gone.)

2353
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:19,410
Chan Sung, help me for a second.

2354
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,680
- Chan Sung.
- Hold out.

2355
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,980
(Doo Ho is out.)

2356
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,050
Hold out.

2357
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,650
(Korean Zombie joins in right away.)

2358
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,320
(Dong Hyun is out.)

2359
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:32,490
(Team Trainer Yang's
strong players are both out.)

2360
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:34,650
- He ripped it off.
- He ripped it off.

2361
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:35,930
- He ripped it off.
- Let's go.

2362
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:37,490
Hurry up.

2363
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:38,600
Why did you get eliminated?

2364
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,030
This is easy.

2365
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:41,560
- Hey.
- Hold on.

2366
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,660
Get him.

2367
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:43,700
- Hold out.
- Get him.

2368
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,730
(He gets grabbed by the collar.)

2369
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:51,310
Throw him down.

2370
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:52,370
There you go.

2371
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,220
(He subdues Suk Jin with one hand.)

2372
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:56,720
Hurry up.

2373
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,110
Hurry up.

2374
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,620
(Suk Jin is out.)

2375
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,560
- He got Suk Jin. Okay.
- Now, the next set of players.

2376
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,930
- Fighting out of the red corner...
- I got the name tag.

2377
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:08,930
is Secquiao,

2378
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,360
Yang Se Chan.

2379
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:14,840
Contending against him is Yootria,
Yoo Jae Suk.

2380
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,510
Okay. We are set.

2381
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:19,110
Go and get him.

2382
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,440
I got eliminated.

2383
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,700
Get him.

2384
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,150
We have no choice
but to finish him off.

2385
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,050
(They corner him gradually.)

2386
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:27,240
This is bad.

2387
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,890
Jong Kook, you need to enter.

2388
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:31,720
Jong Kook might come next,
so we need to finish him off.

2389
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,980
We need to rip off his name tag.

2390
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,360
Rip it off.

2391
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,690
Rip it off.

2392
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:37,060
- Hurry up.
- What should I do?

2393
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:38,900
- Grab him.
- What should I do?

2394
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:40,730
- Lie down.
- Lie down if everything else fails.

2395
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,620
Go to a corner. Run away.

2396
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:43,820
Hold out.

2397
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,640
Hold out.

2398
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:46,660
(Se Chan is out.)

2399
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:47,840
It's game over.

2400
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,030
Jong Kook remains.

2401
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:51,870
- Fighting out of the red corner...
- Jong Kook remains.

2402
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:55,050
is Kim Protein, Kim Jong Kook.

2403
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,110
(Solemn)

2404
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,850
Fighting out of the blue corner
is Hatbari.

2405
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,050
Come on.

2406
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:02,390
- Haha.
- Hatbari.

2407
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:04,110
- Come here.
- Hatbari.

2408
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,780
Hatbari.

2409
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:06,860
Hey.

2410
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,690
Hatbari.

2411
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:09,980
(He subdues Haha with one hand.)

2412
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:11,430
Hey.

2413
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:12,800
Oh, no.

2414
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,020
Hatbari.

2415
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,060
(Slipping)

2416
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:18,640
(Even with three members,
Jong Kook is formidable.)

2417
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:20,940
Even with three members,
it isn't easy to eliminate him.

2418
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,010
Gather around.

2419
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,610
- He is too strong.
- It isn't easy to eliminate him.

2420
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,150
- Jong Kook is...
- He is seriously strong.

2421
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,150
- He is really strong.
- He is too strong.

2422
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:37,980
Hey.

2423
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:39,220
- Hey.
- Eliminate him.

2424
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,450
I got him.

2425
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,430
(He attacks Chan Sung first.)

2426
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,120
(He misses his chance.)

2427
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,430
Do your best until the end.

2428
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:52,100
Another set of players
will enter the ring.

2429
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:55,470
Fighting out of the red corner
is Zoned-Out Gregor, Song Ji Hyo.

2430
01:21:55,700 --> 01:22:00,140
Fighting out of the red corner
is Jeonchimawa Lee, Jeon So Min.

2431
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:01,480
- Hey.
- Ji Hyo.

2432
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:02,740
Ji Hyo, rip off a name tag.

2433
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:03,870
Ji Hyo.

2434
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,050
(Hatbari attacks Ji Hyo.)

2435
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:06,850
Why are there so many people?

2436
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:08,270
- Hey.
- No.

2437
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,980
- Hey.
- No.

2438
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:11,690
(Ji Hyo is out, so Jong Kook
is against 4 people!)

2439
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:13,020
Grab him.

2440
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:15,320
(At that moment)

2441
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,600
(Jae Suk is out.)

2442
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,620
He did it.

2443
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:21,190
This is incredible.

2444
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:22,520
This is incredible. Let's go.

2445
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:24,560
Hey, Chan Sung.

2446
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,470
(Chan Sung, Haha, So Min versus Jong Kook)

2447
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:28,060
- No.
- Hey.

2448
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,610
- No.
- Hey.

2449
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:31,610
(Can Jong Kook fight
against three opponents?)

2450
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,460
- I got it.
- I ripped it.

2451
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:45,790
Hey.

2452
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:48,760
(The moment Jong Kook
grabs Haha's name tag,)

2453
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,460
(he got his name tag ripped first.)

2454
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:56,280
(Jong Kook is out.)

2455
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,880
- Okay.
- That was so close.

2456
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,580
- It was so close.
- We almost lost.

2457
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:02,420
(Team Yoo wins by a whisker.)

2458
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,010
- Is it over?
- It's ripped off.

2459
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:05,010
- Gosh.
- We could've won.

2460
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:07,140
- We win.
- We could've won.

2461
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,010
Jong Kook almost took it off.

2462
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:10,490
- Jong Kook was almost there.
- It was so close.

2463
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,660
I didn't know
there would be so many.

2464
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,550
- Well done.
- My gosh.

2465
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:15,590
Okay.

2466
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:18,160
- Well done.
- It's not easy.

2467
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,960
Team Yoo wins this mission.

2468
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,330
- Okay.
- That was so close.

2469
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:25,460
We did well.

2470
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,240
- You have to pay me.
- Okay. Don't worry.

2471
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,710
The winning team gets 500 dollars.

2472
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:32,610
(Trainer Yoo gets 500 dollars.)

2473
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:33,610
That's a lot.

2474
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:36,750
And the losing team
gets 300 dollars.

2475
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,580
You will have a man-to-man talk
for the final salary negotiation.

2476
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:41,750
But the trainers can offer
as much money as they want.

2477
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,320
Okay. I get it.

2478
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,750
You need to pay
every single player on your team.

2479
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:48,590
Gosh, this time,

2480
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,220
I'll be sure to pay you a lot.

2481
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:51,500
- Okay.
- I believe you.

2482
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,170
- You can be generous.
- Right.

2483
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:54,960
- He's right.
- Please remember what I did.

2484
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,330
- I tried my best.
- I can be reasonable.

2485
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,130
I should've won.

2486
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:03,130
I can't help it
if I get picked and eliminated.

2487
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,970
But I don't want to come in last.

2488
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,040
- Do as he asks.
- The thing is,

2489
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,640
I don't have enough money
to beat Jae Suk.

2490
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:09,950
- Right.
- You can't beat him anyway.

2491
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:11,580
- So give us more money.
- Right.

2492
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,010
You'll look cool
if you get a penalty like that.

2493
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:14,640
(The trainer with less money
gets a penalty too.)

2494
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,580
We have enough money. Don't worry.

2495
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,250
Maybe 100 dollars at most.

2496
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,700
I guess I can spend
about 140 dollars.

2497
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,420
So I'll give you 40 dollars each.

2498
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,070
- Really?
- I'll give you 40 dollars.

2499
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:30,870
(The fighters get 40 dollars each.)

2500
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:32,670
I misunderstood you
at the beginning.

2501
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:34,070
- Right. I had no idea.
- It's just...

2502
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:35,500
that I saw the big picture.

2503
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,780
- I feel like crying.
- I'm not so stingy.

2504
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,450
- I'm so moved.
- Me too.

2505
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:41,380
- We talked about 10 and 20 cents.
- This is so touching.

2506
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,920
- The world is still warm.
- Right. I'm moved.

2507
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:44,950
- And you two.
- Yes.

2508
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:45,950
I'll give you ten dollars each.

2509
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:49,050
- Thank you.
- Gosh, this is crazy.

2510
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,220
I have a complaint.
Why are you being generous after I left?

2511
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:54,380
I mean, when I was on your team,

2512
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,460
you were being very stingy.

2513
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,050
This was my plan,
but you left too soon.

2514
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,700
- That's right.
- Is that it?

2515
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,130
I made up my mind, but you left.

2516
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,590
- About the penalty.
- Okay.

2517
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:05,570
The trainer with less money
will get the penalty.

2518
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:08,460
And the member with the least money
will get the penalty.

2519
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:11,930
And among the members except
for the two who get the prize,

2520
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,880
we will randomly pick one
to get the penalty.

2521
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,110
There's a lot.

2522
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,580
At least one on my team
will get picked.

2523
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:19,380
The penalty we prepared for today...

2524
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,840
- can be very cumbersome.
- Is it?

2525
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,860
It's something you'd hate.

2526
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:27,680
So I was thinking
we could probably let you...

2527
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,920
choose between
the penalty and a low kick.

2528
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:34,370
My gosh. It might kill you.

2529
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,870
We won't be able to walk.

2530
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:38,170
The penalty is...

2531
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:40,960
diamond painting
which is very popular these days.

2532
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,430
You should glue
little pieces to the sheet.

2533
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:44,780
I'll just get kicked.

2534
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,970
- It's better to get kicked and go.
- That's a lot better.

2535
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:51,670
First, I'll announce the results
of the two trainers.

2536
01:25:52,290 --> 01:25:53,820
- Trainer Yoo.
- Please.

2537
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:54,920
Yang Se Chan wins.

2538
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,860
He has 496.94 dollars.

2539
01:25:58,860 --> 01:25:59,920
He does?

2540
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,920
(Team Yoo: 496.94 dollars)

2541
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,130
Trainer Yang.

2542
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:06,220
He has 591.66 dollars.

2543
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,330
(Trainer Yoo: 591.66 dollars)

2544
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,870
He has that much money?

2545
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:11,670
- So Trainer Yang wins.
- You could give us 20 dollars each.

2546
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,040
He didn't spend any money.

2547
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,870
I kept most of the money.

2548
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,500
- My goodness.
- Jae Suk.

2549
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,780
You got 500 dollars.
How is that possible?

2550
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,280
- He distributed all the money.
- I shared it with them.

2551
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,080
- Really?
- Before this round,

2552
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:26,010
Jae Suk received a reward,
so he was winning by 40 dollars.

2553
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,420
Really? How did it happen?

2554
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:32,130
But Se Chan gave only 0.1 cent
to his team members.

2555
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:33,750
We got 0.1 cent each.

2556
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:36,030
(Getting 0.1 cents and 0.2 cents)

2557
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:37,220
We got 0.1 cent each.

2558
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:38,760
I made a mistake.

2559
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,700
All right.
Now I will announce the ninth place...

2560
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,670
who will get the penalty.

2561
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:44,670
You announce it first?

2562
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:47,710
It's the athlete
with the salary of 1.5 dollars.

2563
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:50,040
- It's Song Ji Hyo.
- Oh, dear.

2564
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:52,710
And I'll announce
the two athletes...

2565
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:55,750
with the biggest salaries.

2566
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,170
- Okay.
- Two athletes.

2567
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,340
Gosh, this is...

2568
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,010
Number two is...

2569
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,290
It must be someone on my team.

2570
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:04,380
It's an athlete with a salary...

2571
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:06,180
- of 116.5 dollars.
- What?

2572
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:07,860
- It's Choi Doo Ho.
- Yes.

2573
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:10,960
- Doo Ho.
- I knew it was our team.

2574
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,420
- There you go.
- Good.

2575
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,030
- It's our team.
- That's nice.

2576
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:16,870
- He's the salary king.
- The salary king.

2577
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,760
- That's amazing.
- I was deeply moved.

2578
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:19,870
- Good.
- That's a lot.

2579
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:23,130
Now I will announce number one.

2580
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:26,580
The winner
with the biggest salary is...

2581
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:29,470
It's the athlete
with a salary of 118 dollars.

2582
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:30,840
- It's Choo Sung Hoon.
- Me?

2583
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,140
Congratulations.

2584
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:33,750
- It's Choo Sung Hoon.
- Me?

2585
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,340
- Congratulations.
- My gosh.

2586
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:36,860
They're both on my team.

2587
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:39,160
- That's right.
- When did you get so much money?

2588
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,830
- He went back and forth.
- Look at that.

2589
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:42,960
You took a lot of money
while going back and forth.

2590
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,590
I'm number one? Thank you.

2591
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:46,090
- I'm so moved.
- That's unbelievable.

2592
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,760
My goodness.

2593
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,670
The rest of you...

2594
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,760
should come and pick one each.

2595
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,960
- All of us?
- Let's go and pick one.

2596
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,210
- Not me.
- I'll take what's left.

2597
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:58,280
- It can't be the one at the end.
- How many of us will get it?

2598
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,970
- Only one?
- One.

2599
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:02,380
I'd like you to open it one by one.

2600
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:04,420
(Only 1 of the 6 members
will get the penalty.)

2601
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:06,420
- Haha, you go first.
- I hope it's you.

2602
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:07,420
(Haha opens it first.)

2603
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:09,920
- I can't see it.
- Nice.

2604
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:12,360
- Jeon So Bal.
- Please.

2605
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,660
(It's So Min's turn to open it.)

2606
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,200
(Sighing)

2607
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,860
- Why?
- It's either So Min or me.

2608
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:19,130
- Seriously...
- It's So Min or me.

2609
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,870
I really don't understand.

2610
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:21,870
(Penalty)

2611
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:23,330
I really don't understand.

2612
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:25,960
(So Min gets the penalty
against the odds of 6 to 1.)

2613
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,710
- Why is it always...
- It's always her.

2614
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:29,130
- What's wrong with me?
- You're so unlucky.

2615
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:30,970
- How do I do this?
- That's strange.

2616
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:33,710
Like we heard before,
the penalty will be...

2617
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:36,750
either the diamond painting
or a low kick.

2618
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:38,420
I'll go first.

2619
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:41,250
I've done this
with Chan Sung before.

2620
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,680
- Are you going to be okay?
- I'll be fine.

2621
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,860
Chan Sung does
a lot of variety shows,

2622
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,380
so he knows we need good reactions.

2623
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:49,250
Now that I'm at this,
I should do it properly.

2624
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:51,550
Now that it's already like this...

2625
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:53,070
- Right.
- He's taking off his socks.

2626
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:54,370
Chan Sung,
you don't have to take off your shoes.

2627
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:56,670
Jae Suk is bony,
so your foot might hurt.

2628
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:59,410
He doesn't need to use his legs,

2629
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:00,960
- Don't worry.
- so it's all right.

2630
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,670
- Are you sure it's okay?
- It's all right.

2631
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,880
It can either hurt for days
or hurt just for a moment.

2632
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,210
- I'll make it hurt for a moment.
- Make it short.

2633
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:09,920
All right. Don't worry about me.

2634
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,540
- All right.
- I think it will be hard.

2635
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:14,210
(Groaning)

2636
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:19,420
- Your buttocks...
- My gosh. Are you all right?

2637
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:20,750
This is Running Man.

2638
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:21,920
(Chan Sung has adapted
to variety shows completely.)

2639
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,920
- You flew off.
- My goodness.

2640
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,920
- He flew away.
- You just flew.

2641
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,460
- Are you all right?
- Did you two work on it together?

2642
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:30,670
- Did you work with him on that?
- You showed good teamwork.

2643
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:32,330
That was great teamwork.

2644
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:34,110
Go catch Jung Chan Sung.

2645
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:36,710
- It was great teamwork.
- Impressive teamwork.

2646
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,950
- Hey, come here.
- Gosh, how did he do this?

2647
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:42,280
It's different from when
you kicked me on another show.

2648
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,040
- My goodness.
- It hurts only for a moment.

2649
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,540
That's amazing though.

2650
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:48,680
When I got kicked before,
it hurt for a long time.

2651
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,420
- But it doesn't hurt now.
- It doesn't?

2652
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:52,180
- It lasts only for a moment.
- Right.

2653
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,050
- One more time.
- That's a good technique.

2654
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,920
Seriously, you're good at this.

2655
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,360
- Is it different?
- At first...

2656
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,790
- Do you want to try it?
- You should get the penalty.

2657
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,590
No, I'll do the diamond painting.

2658
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:01,670
(Frightened)

2659
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:04,070
Jae Suk didn't cry.
Let's give him a big hand.

2660
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:06,000
- Okay.
- He didn't cry.

2661
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:08,300
All right.
Thank you for joining our show today.

2662
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:09,780
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2663
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,130
Thank you so much.

2664
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:12,130
- Thank you.
