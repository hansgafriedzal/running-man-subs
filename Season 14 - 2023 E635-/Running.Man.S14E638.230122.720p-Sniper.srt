1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,570
In 1962,

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,940
starting with selling gourd bowls
in the corner of a market...

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,080
- Korea's export...
- Excessively high interest...

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,270
IMF, International...

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,840
- During the IMF Crisis...
- Exporting...

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,250
They established new goals for the
40th anniversary of the founding.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,090
That's how Soonbak Group
grew to become a conglomerate.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,860
As the chairman of Soonbak Group
who died not long ago...

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,330
left a will,

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,090
the Soonbak Group family
has gathered.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,400
What time is it now?
Why are they not here yet? These punks.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,570
I should teach them a lesson.
What time is it now?

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,330
(1-0: Ji Suk Jin, the eldest son)

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,400
By the way, should I make a pool
in front of this place?

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,680
(Three people are coming in
while complaining.)

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,110
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,580
(1-1: Yoo Jae Suk, the 2nd son)

18
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,110
(1-2: Kim Jong Kook, the 3rd son)

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,250
My gosh.

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,650
It's cold.

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,830
Why did they call me
when I'm busy? My gosh.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,170
(1-5: Song Ji Hyo, the 2nd daughter)

23
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,580
(The daughter
the chairman cherished the most)

24
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,580
(1-6: Jeon So Min, the 3rd daughter)

25
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,640
Gosh. What is going on?

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
(And the youngest son
of the conglomerate family)

27
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,650
(1-7: Yang Se Chan, the youngest)

28
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,650
That's how the seven siblings
gathered...

29
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,150
at the eldest son's house.

30
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:43,060
My gosh. Why are they not coming?

31
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,700
Seriously.

32
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,560
Here they are. Why are you so late?

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,530
- Well...
- You...

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,670
How old are you?

35
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,480
- Me?
- You look like the youngest...

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,250
judging by the hat. How old are you?

37
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,580
- I'm the 2nd eldest.
- You're the 2nd eldest?

38
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,950
- How have you been, brother?
- We're a family.

39
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,420
- Why did you call us?
- Why were you so late?

40
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,890
Don't block the camera.

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,120
How many years
have you been in the industry?

42
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,450
Why are you blocking the camera?

43
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,950
Why did you call us?

44
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,390
- Okay.
- "Why did you call us?"

45
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,760
- Where do I sit?
- It's an important day.

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,860
- Come here, Jong Kook.
- Here?

47
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,950
Come and sit here.

48
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,390
- Suk Jin.
- Until when will you... Why?

49
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,490
Why did you not prepare any food?

50
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,760
It's for tea.

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,670
- What do you mean there's no food?
- I mean...

52
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,170
I prepared this sandwich for you.

53
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,880
No one in the family
eats sandwiches.

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,300
- I mean...
- Come on.

55
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,410
He really doesn't suit
a character who is rich.

56
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,540
I've never been rich.

57
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,080
- I can't act like one.
- The role play...

58
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,290
We're not a conglomerate family.

59
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,160
- It's not going well.
- We...

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,160
- So we don't know.
- I was cold in the helicopter.

61
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,130
Because most of us are self-made,

62
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,230
- It's hard.
- we can't play the characters well.

63
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,790
Honestly,
all of us grew up in poor families.

64
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,860
When I was little,
my mom would give me hot water...

65
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,610
so that I could wash up
in the kitchen.

66
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,580
- Oh, my.
- You came.

67
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,880
- What?
- Oh, gosh.

68
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,380
- She looks like Jung Hye Young.
- Right.

69
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,450
- Joong Ki's mother.
- His mom.

70
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,110
- She does?
- Yes. Joong Ki's mother.

71
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,510
- Wait.
- I'm Joong Ki's...

72
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,790
- It's "AM Plaza."
- mother?

73
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,580
She's Patti Kim.

74
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,660
- "AM Plaza."
- You are barefooted.

75
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,450
It's winter.

76
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,580
Don't they need to change her voice?

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,860
I'm sorry,
but is that a UFO on your head?

78
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,290
Hold on.

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,520
- Our youngest sister.
- Hello.

80
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,440
Suk Jin, I stopped by
the salon today.

81
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,830
- Why did you go to the salon?
- Yes.

82
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,910
- I need to anyway.
- Grandpa.

83
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,460
- "Grandpa?"
- Grandpa.

84
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,580
- I'm the eldest son.
- He's the eldest son.

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,480
After our father died...

86
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,610
- The role-playing...
- None of us were rich.

87
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,040
No one here grew up wealthy.

88
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,850
We don't know what it's like
to be rich.

89
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,880
Who's who?

90
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,890
What rich kid wears a hat
like this one?

91
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,610
- He also...
- Are you a painter?

92
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,190
- Look at him.
- No one rich dresses like that.

93
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,480
Are you the bodyguard?

94
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,230
- It's good to see you all.
- You call him a rich guy?

95
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,550
- My goodness.
- No way.

96
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,330
Chauffeur Yang!

97
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,920
Chauffeur Yang,
you aren't supposed to be here.

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,100
What...

99
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,540
No one would think
he's from a rich family.

100
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,410
I'll be the one to buy Soonyang.

101
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,640
(How shameless can he be?)

102
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,800
- Jae Suk...
- Come on.

103
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,450
I heard someone over there
call me "Song Choong Yi."

104
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,670
- This is hilarious.
- Chauffeur Yang!

105
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,850
- Is he the youngest son?
- Hey.

106
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,980
- Woong's father, sit down.
- Butler Yang.

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,740
- I can't believe it.
- It's like this.

108
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,610
You're like the uncle...

109
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,010
of the friend...

110
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,720
of the youngest son
of a rich family.

111
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,780
The ugliest friend of that uncle.

112
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,650
I'll buy it.

113
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,930
Then...

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,720
will Suk Jin be inheriting
the company?

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,440
- It's not like that.
- No, it's mine.

116
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,240
- Didn't you watch the show?
- You should know...

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,870
- It's mine.
- I met with my lawyer.

118
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,660
Why isn't anybody here to greet me?

119
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,310
(Around that time...)

120
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,600
I might freeze to death.

121
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,010
(Someone is here
in hopes of inheriting the company.)

122
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,550
I'll make the announcement
when everyone gets here.

123
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,410
- No way. Are you kidding me?
- Who is it?

124
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,890
- Who is it?
- Seriously?

125
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,620
- No way.
- Jin Hwa Young?

126
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,780
Shin Rok!

127
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,650
But I already bought
the Soonyang Department Store.

128
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,130
- Soonyang Department Store.
- She's the real deal.

129
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,720
- Hello.
- Goodness.

130
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,390
- Shin Rok.
- No way.

131
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,560
Our second... No, third.

132
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,830
Gosh, it's been a while.

133
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,960
Why haven't you been in touch?

134
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,460
- What's the matter with you?
- Hold on.

135
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,870
- We're family.
- What are you saying?

136
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,100
He's my brother.

137
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,330
- She's my sister, you know.
- Shin Rok.

138
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,340
(In the series "Reborn Rich,")

139
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,380
(Kim Shin Rok played Jin Hwa Young...)

140
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,450
(from the Soonyang Family.)

141
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,410
(From her egotistical ways
and bullying of others...)

142
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,890
(to playing the immature
sweet daughter)

143
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,500
(She also played a vagabond
in "Hellbound"...)

144
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,870
(which was
a completely different character.)

145
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,890
(Scene-stealer Kim Shin Rok)

146
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,100
- Hello.
- Please have a seat.

147
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,310
There's the son of a rich man.

148
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,530
Her acting is phenomenal.

149
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,270
I can't believe Shin Rok is here.

150
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,010
- I didn't expect this at all.
- You have such a sweet look.

151
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,250
- I didn't expect it either.
- Give it up for her.

152
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,250
- Applaud!
- Thank you.

153
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,710
We begin the year...

154
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,210
- with a superstar.
- Exactly.

155
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,910
- My gosh.
- "Dad!"

156
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,450
- You know...
- I found you so annoying.

157
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,390
- That's how good she is.
- Her acting is this good.

158
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,490
She's that good.

159
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,390
You seem so charming
and warm right now.

160
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,430
It's because she is smiling.

161
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,630
- I was told to play a character.
- Shin Rok...

162
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,520
That had me nervous,
but I guess it wasn't the case.

163
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,200
- We're bad at role-playing.
- We're terrible at this.

164
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,700
We didn't grow up
in wealthy families.

165
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,940
I started off
with nothing to my name.

166
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,030
- Please introduce yourself.
- Tell us who you are.

167
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,270
Hello, I'm Actress Kim Shin Rok.

168
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,810
(They applaud a second time!)

169
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,210
Your name Shin Rok
is quite unique though.

170
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,820
- Is it your real name?
- That's right.

171
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,010
- No way.
- Shin Rok.

172
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,250
- Let's take a brief moment...
- Yes.

173
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,150
- to get to know her.
- Sure thing.

174
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,280
- Shin Rok's life story...
- Yes?

175
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,580
Her life so far
has been extraordinary.

176
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,300
- There's nothing normal about it.
- Really?

177
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,760
I have no choice...

178
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,800
- but to tell people this.
- What is it?

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,570
- She graduated from SNU.
- SNU?

180
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,440
- Really?
- She got a master's degree.

181
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,940
- She graduated from SNU.
- Why are you surprised by that?

182
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,440
Hwang Seog Jeong graduated
from SNU too.

183
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,970
Shin Rok also graduated from
that university.

184
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,700
- And...
- What did you major in?

185
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,880
- Geography.
- That's right.

186
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,680
- Geography?
- Geography.

187
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,010
- Geography?
- I almost wet my pants.

188
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,620
(I almost wet my pants.)

189
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,580
That's so embarrassing.

190
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,950
(His 1-dimensional thinking
is too vulgar.)

191
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,710
You almost wet your pants
because she studied geography?

192
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,580
One could even study the outback.

193
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,020
Geography and studying the outback.

194
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,850
All I know is puffer fish stew.

195
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,660
Shin Rok...

196
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,390
hoped to be a lawyer,
a diplomat, or the president.

197
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,070
- That's understandable.
- Of course.

198
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,700
You can hope to be that
if you get good grades.

199
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,940
I'm impressed.

200
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,640
But then she suddenly
took upon acting.

201
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,600
- Why though?
- Out of the blue?

202
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,810
- You got good grades.
- Your parents must've disapproved.

203
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,470
- We need to talk.
- Why though?

204
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,910
- Shin Rok, come on.
- What a waste.

205
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,080
Your parents
must've been disappointed...

206
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,490
when you told them
you wanted to be an actor.

207
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,120
- Her father is a stage actor.
- Really?

208
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,130
She should answer that. Not you.

209
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,720
- I want to hear it from her.
- I know everything about her.

210
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
Let Shin Rok answer.

211
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,130
- I know everything about her.
- Is he a stage actor?

212
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,200
- Shin Rok, tell us.
- I looked her up online...

213
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,720
and gathered the facts.

214
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,000
He acted in plays before I was born.

215
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,370
When I was in middle school,

216
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,160
he took me
to a local theater company...

217
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,830
and suggested that I have
some fun acting on stage.

218
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,080
He wanted me...

219
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,400
to learn about life
more than the theater.

220
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,470
"Learn about life."

221
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,210
The overall tone of her voice...

222
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,510
and the certain words she uses...

223
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,060
make her seem classy.

224
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,260
I need to seem more graceful.

225
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,190
There's something classy about you.

226
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,330
Let's do this.

227
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,090
You do seem classy.

228
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,560
It's like reading
the New York Times.

229
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,590
She sounds intelligent.

230
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,390
You sounded like
the leader of women.

231
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,000
I say this because of what I heard
during her acceptance speech.

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,700
- That gives it away.
- What does?

233
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,830
- This is how classy she is.
- The words?

234
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,810
- Listen to this.
- What did she say?

235
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,510
"I ponder about people and the world
through plays."

236
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,640
- "Ponder?"
- What did you mean by that?

237
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,780
- "Ponder."
- Through plays?

238
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,370
"I ponder about people
and the world."

239
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,610
- "Ponder?"
- "Ponder?"

240
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,920
"Ponder?"

241
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,080
Do you know what that means?

242
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,290
- Ponder.
- Do you get it?

243
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,520
She ponders.

244
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,060
I know what it is to share.

245
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,060
Sharing is when we divide something
between us.

246
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,190
- Meanwhile, pondering...
- I know what it is.

247
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,950
Is it like living vicariously
through someone?

248
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,430
What the...

249
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,400
- I shouldn't be doing that.
- Pondering.

250
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,170
That's not it.
This is how you ponder.

251
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,670
Is it "to think?"

252
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,130
- I'm curious though.
- Hold on a second.

253
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,500
You said you pondered.

254
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,580
But shouldn't you speak in words
that most people can understand?

255
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll stick to "think" from now on.

256
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,450
(She levels it down for them.)

257
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,420
- Check this out as well.
- What is it?

258
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,980
- This is also just as mesmerizing.
- What is it?

259
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,080
- It's implicit and witty.
- What did she say?

260
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,110
After winning an award
at the Baeksang Arts Awards,

261
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,660
she said that the latter half of
her life was like an energy booster.

262
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,720
("The latter half of my life
is like an energy booster.")

263
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,850
I love that expression.

264
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,990
- A friend like an energy booster
- Nice!

265
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,800
- I love that expression.
- An energy booster.

266
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,440
Like milk thistle.

267
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,860
Like Omega-3.

268
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,540
Like probiotics.

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,810
Like a stimulant drug.

270
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,910
You love to read in your spare time.

271
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,080
(It couldn't be classier.
She loves to read.)

272
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,200
In other words,
I don't do much in my spare time.

273
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,550
She isn't like us, is she?

274
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,820
She lived the life
of someone with rich parents.

275
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,150
- I'm sure it's not all you like.
- Reading.

276
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,610
What's the latest book you read?

277
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,980
- Sorry?
- What's the latest book you read?

278
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,160
The book I've been reading...

279
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,350
I've been aiming
for a miracle morning, so...

280
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,560
- A miracle morning?
- Yes.

281
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,620
- A miracle morning.
- Getting up early.

282
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,930
Yes, it's about
starting the day early.

283
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,350
- Dong Hoon.
- The morning...

284
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,860
- I thought it was breakfast.
- Don't ask...

285
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,860
if you know you can't
understand the answer.

286
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,130
You need to explain these things
in layman's terms.

287
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,000
They wouldn't know
what a miracle morning is.

288
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,670
I doubt those two
know what it is either.

289
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,970
So Min, have you been practicing
miracle mornings?

290
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,470
Getting up miraculously
in the morning?

291
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,970
(Getting up miraculously
in the morning?)

292
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,820
That's right. Exactly.

293
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,080
- So Min.
- Come on.

294
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
I thought of the breakfast meal
at the fast-food joint.

295
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,790
I thought she meant a good morning.

296
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,520
What's a miracle morning?

297
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,720
In the morning,

298
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,560
- you wake up early to...
- Please tell us.

299
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,300
Just say that
you wake up early, then.

300
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,670
Why use tricky words?

301
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,230
Stop making us ponder!

302
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,700
We're nothing like the people...

303
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,600
- you associate yourself with.
- A lot, actually.

304
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,830
You're right though.
It's about waking up miraculously.

305
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,470
Do your eyes open wide
almost instantly in the morning?

306
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,180
No, not really.
What I mean is that...

307
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,100
My head's killing me.

308
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,580
Let's ponder.

309
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,790
- Ponder.
- Let's ponder.

310
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,210
Anyway, Shin Rok
came to greet us in the new year,

311
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,980
- and we're happy to see you.
- It's nice to meet you.

312
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,430
Anyway, joining us today
is Shin Rok.

313
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,250
I will now read...

314
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,170
the last will and testament
left by the CEO of Soonbak Group.

315
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,170
- Finally.
- The game has begun.

316
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,400
- It's our father's legacy.
- By Chairman Jin Yang Cheol.

317
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,460
(Who will inherit
Soonbak Group's assets?)

318
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,830
- Hold on.
- Wait.

319
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,040
- Wait. Are you the lawyer?
- You got a promotion.

320
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,470
- It's Mr. Hype Boy.
- Dance to "Hype Boy."

321
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,870
(It's the dancing lawyer.)

322
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,870
Dance for us.

323
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,950
It's Mr. Hype Boy.

324
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,920
- He's such a good dancer.
- Mr. Lawyer.

325
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,880
- Are you all present?
- Yes.

326
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,920
Then I will read...

327
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,750
- His acting is terrible, isn't it?
- the last will and testament...

328
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,380
- left by the CEO...
- Terrible, right?

329
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,560
- His pants are...
- Look at his pants.

330
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,930
- Hold on a second.
- They seem like dancer pants.

331
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,430
They're too wrinkled.

332
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,330
His acting will be atrocious.

333
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,460
What's with the chin hairs?

334
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,900
Are you all present?

335
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,330
- Yes, we're here.
- That we are.

336
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,910
You can see that we are gathered.

337
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,230
Then,

338
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,730
I will now read
the last will and testament...

339
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,540
left by the CEO of Soonbak Group.

340
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,340
I will now read
the last will and testament...

341
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,840
left by the CEO of Soonbak Group.

342
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,780
- It's Soonbak Group.
- Soonbak Group?

343
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,950
"Last Will and Testament."

344
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,080
- "Last Will and Testament."
- I can't wait.

345
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,820
- "Over the years..."
- Over the years,

346
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,690
I have watched Suk Jin
execute his business projects.

347
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,290
It is why I have decided
to abolish the rule...

348
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,830
that says the eldest
inherits the company.

349
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,220
"To abolish the rule that says
the eldest inherits the company."

350
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,590
That sounds good.

351
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,830
Dad, wait.

352
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,070
- We knew it.
- After all the promise I showed?

353
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,940
Everything depends on luck,
not effort.

354
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,040
The one who is lucky...

355
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,330
will inherit Soonbak Group.

356
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,000
It all depends on luck?

357
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,050
You, me, and So Min have no chance.

358
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,370
You will be given
eight subsidiary companies...

359
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,690
that I hold different amounts
of shares.

360
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,950
It is up to you
to split them among yourselves.

361
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,950
Use what you have
to buy more shares of the group...

362
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,580
and become the true successor
of Soonbak Group.

363
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,120
"Become the true successor
of Soonbak Group."

364
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,900
(Luck will decide
who the successor is?)

365
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,070
- Good.
- Got it.

366
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,090
Got it.

367
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,990
- What's this?
- Hold on.

368
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,330
- What is it?
- The subsidiaries.

369
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,570
Our father had a soft spot
for the adorable ones.

370
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,460
He likes what is adorable.

371
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,600
He had too many lines for someone
whose acting is atrocious.

372
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,330
You should've danced
to "Hype Boy" while exiting.

373
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,340
- What are the subsidiaries?
- Here we go.

374
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,180
- We have a rental car company.
- Nice.

375
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,370
- An investment company.
- Soonbak Investment.

376
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,480
An investment company?

377
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
- Electronics.
- That I should have.

378
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,880
- A cultural foundation.
- A cultural foundation.

379
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,290
There's also FC Soonbak.

380
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,880
- A soccer club.
- That's mine!

381
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,060
We own a soccer club.

382
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,250
Soonbak Entertainment.

383
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,450
- Oh, an entertainment agency?
- I want the entertainment agency.

384
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,360
And Soonbak Daily.
So there's a newspaper company too.

385
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,960
- A lodging business.
- A lodging business.

386
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,130
(Soonbak Lodging)

387
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,360
(The shares for each subsidiary will
be revealed...)

388
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,100
(after the choices are made.)

389
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,040
- You see, guys...
- Yes?

390
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,370
Honestly, I don't want much.

391
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,910
- Even when I saw those...
- Really?

392
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,100
Then the lodging business is yours.

393
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,780
- Thanks.
- It's yours.

394
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,580
- Doesn't he run one already?
- He got the lodging business.

395
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,420
- Just go and cook some meat for us.
- Can you start a barbecue fire?

396
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,550
Just cook some meat for us.

397
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,980
- All right. Settle down.
- Go out and start a fire for us.

398
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,790
I'll take the entertainment agency
and get lost. Give it to me.

399
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,450
- She said she'd get lost.
- You'll get lost...

400
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,490
- if you get the company?
- I'll get lost if you give me that.

401
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,030
- Then the entertainment agency...
- Give me a chance to pick one too.

402
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,090
- Why would you distribute them?
- I mean... Suk Jin.

403
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,360
- Why are we distributing these now?
- It's not like that.

404
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,270
Shouldn't we play
rock-paper-scissors or something?

405
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,300
Each of us should get
what we're interested in.

406
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,700
- I want the electronics company.
- Sorry?

407
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,870
You want the electronics company?

408
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,780
- Suk Jin is the only person...
- Yes.

409
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,870
who graduated from
a four-year college...

410
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,450
- among the cast members.
- That's true.

411
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,470
- And he's got class.
- He is, indeed.

412
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,710
- That's true.
- He's a well-educated man.

413
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,480
- He gets the cultural foundation.
- Yes.

414
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,560
Hey, that was the worst one
in the drama.

415
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,350
It was the worst one.

416
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,530
This is what they offered
to Joong Ki's father.

417
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,900
- No!
- It turned out to be a good one.

418
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,400
- No, I don't want it.
- Then...

419
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,830
I don't want
the lodging business either!

420
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,200
Hey, it has three bedrooms.

421
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,570
- Then you have it.
- It's not like what you think.

422
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,230
It's just a cabin! Darn.

423
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,940
- Hey, list it on Airbnb.
- Give it back to me.

424
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,680
- Right. List it on Airbnb.
- You said we were rich.

425
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,450
- A conglomerate owner family.
- You can get 1,000 dollars a month.

426
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,450
- Let's start over again. Then...
- I didn't mean I wanted that.

427
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,610
Shin Rok,
which business do you want to run?

428
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,840
Jae Suk,
I want the electronics company.

429
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,380
- My gosh.
- Many of us want that company.

430
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,160
- Let's decide randomly.
- Many of us want it.

431
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,210
- I want to make a lot of money.
- It's a profitable business.

432
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,250
- The electronics company is good.
- Then... Hold on a second.

433
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,590
Since Shin Rok wants
the electronics company,

434
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,750
how about those of you who want
the electronics company...

435
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,430
- play rock-paper-scissors?
- Let's do that.

436
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,220
How about those of you who want
the electronics company...

437
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,860
- play rock-paper-scissors?
- Let's do that.

438
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,270
- Now...
- All right. Then...

439
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,540
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Who wants Soonbak Electronics?

440
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,960
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

441
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,410
- Okay. Shin Rok and I won.
- Let's...

442
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,600
- The winner gets the company?
- Yes.

443
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,700
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

444
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
(Screaming)

445
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,970
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

446
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,470
(Shrieking with disappointment)

447
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,320
- Hey, just give it to her.
- What was that?

448
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,840
I remember her screaming like that.

449
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,080
- She screamed like crazy.
- The 1st person to win 2 rounds?

450
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,690
- Give it to our dear little sister.
- Right.

451
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,690
- You can have it.
- Okay. I'll give this to her.

452
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,200
- No, you don't have to do that.
- It's okay, Shin Rok. You have it.

453
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,030
Since he gave it to you,
you can have it.

454
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,070
- Really?
- Of course.

455
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,430
Soonbak Electronics is the biggest
of all.

456
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,630
- I want the entertainment agency.
- True.

457
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,590
- I want that too.
- I want...

458
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,540
- the entertainment agency.
- As for the entertainment agency...

459
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,810
Since So Min was the first one
who said she wanted it,

460
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,580
- she gets the entertainment agency.
- Thank you, Jae Suk.

461
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,650
- I want Soonbak Daily, Jae Suk.
- Okay.

462
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,310
- Soonbak Daily?
- Yes, Soonbak Daily.

463
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,410
She wants the newspaper company.
Okay.

464
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,780
- A newspaper company...
- I want Soonbak Investment.

465
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,710
- Here you go.
- A newspaper company is good.

466
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,320
- It's a good business.
- Give Jong Kook the soccer team.

467
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,550
- Jong Kook, you can have it.
- But I don't think...

468
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,690
- it's very profitable.
- You should have it.

469
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,530
How nice would it be to have
your own soccer team?

470
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,530
Exactly.

471
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,930
- Hey, give it to me.
- Next up is Soonbak Rental Car.

472
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,930
- I want Soonbak Rental Car.
- Wait.

473
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,530
Give me Soonbak Rental Car!

474
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,120
- I might get Soonbak Lodging.
- Soonbak Lodging.

475
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,670
- I want Soonbak Rental Car.
- Let's...

476
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,900
- choose the rest randomly.
- Randomly?

477
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,460
- Okay.
- That's a good idea.

478
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,100
- Let's do that.
- Then you choose first.

479
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,080
- This is...
- I pick the one in the middle.

480
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,130
The one in the middle?

481
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,080
- Soonbak Cultural Foundation. Okay.
- Oh, that's not bad.

482
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,550
- A cultural foundation sounds cool.
- Okay.

483
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,970
- Soonbak Lodging is the worst.
- All right.

484
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,280
But the lodging business...

485
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,550
- might be very profitable.
- I think we'll use our shares...

486
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,660
- Gosh. I got Soonbak Lodging.
- Great. It's Soonbak Rental Car.

487
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,160
- I knew he'd get that.
- I got Soonbak Lodging.

488
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,290
I got Soonbak Rental Car.

489
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,380
You have distributed
the eight subsidiaries.

490
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,990
- The share ratio is what matters.
- Yes. The total amount...

491
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,360
of the shares takes up 70 percent
of Soonbak Group's shares.

492
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,620
- And the shares have been...
- Did you say 70 percent?

493
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,330
- Yes. It's been divided randomly.
- I guess so.

494
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,490
I should take all those shares
from the others to win.

495
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,360
Each of you will go...

496
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,460
- and check your share ratio now.
- Oh, I get it.

497
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,910
But it could be different from
what we expect.

498
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,330
- Maybe Soonbak Lodging...
- If you look at the history...

499
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,080
- You're right.
- Rather than a large company,

500
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,320
- A small company...
- in many cases, a small one...

501
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,970
- is the holding company.
- There are many such companies.

502
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,970
I'll go first.

503
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,110
- I wonder if he has many shares.
- Maybe you have the most shares.

504
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,380
(The owner of Soonbak Investment
goes to check his shares first.)

505
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,320
(Song Choong Yi puts on airs
as he appears.)

506
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,530
Soonbak Investment.

507
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,080
I'll buy that company.

508
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,380
(Soonbak Investment)

509
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,070
The share ratio
of Soonbak Investment is...

510
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,090
What percentage did you say?

511
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,740
Out of 70 percent? That's the worst.

512
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,860
Why did I pick this company?

513
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
The next person can go now.

514
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,870
- You don't seem very happy.
- You look...

515
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,710
- You can take turns and check.
- You look a little upset.

516
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,810
- Go and check your shares.
- Shall I go next?

517
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,750
- You look really upset.
- No, I'm fine.

518
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,790
I have a feeling this company
will make me rich.

519
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,640
I don't think
it's just a small business.

520
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,580
I think there's someone
who has only one percent.

521
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,620
(Next up is FC Soonbak.)

522
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,180
I chose it because I loved soccer.

523
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,260
But soccer isn't
a profitable business.

524
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,960
I would rather suffer losses.

525
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,390
- Your share ratio is...
- Yes.

526
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,360
- eight percent.
- What percentage again?

527
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,500
Eight percent.

528
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,040
Out of 80...
I mean, out of 70 percent,

529
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,540
I only have eight percent?

530
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,010
Darn it.

531
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,640
(Next up is Soonbak Rental Car.)

532
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,020
What's my share ratio?

533
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,410
It's five percent.

534
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,520
(Soonbak Rental Car Shares:
5 percent)

535
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,850
You received one R coin
per percent stock share.

536
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,080
This is driving me nuts.

537
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,380
Gosh. I can't believe this.

538
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,920
Darn.

539
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,730
- Suk Jin.
- There must be large differences.

540
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,350
- Why do you look...
- You're done for, right?

541
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,390
- Right. He looks upset.
- Oh, no.

542
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,000
Your business went bankrupt?

543
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,970
Seok Sam is done for. I can tell.

544
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,570
- He's done for.
- He's dirt broke.

545
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,900
- Shin Rok, I'll go next.
- No.

546
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,540
- See you later.
- You can't tell by my face.

547
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,240
- I bet he's done for.
- That was funny.

548
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,600
Right. He looks disappointed.

549
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,940
All right. Let's go and check.

550
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,050
- Let's go.
- He...

551
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,580
He's bad at hiding his emotions.

552
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,820
I'll be able to tell by his face.

553
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,080
- Right. He can't hide it.
- Absolutely.

554
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,790
I'll tell you what he does.

555
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,380
If he gets disappointed,
he'll smile when he comes back.

556
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,460
If he gets more than he expected,
he won't smile.

557
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,890
- Isn't that what you usually do?
- He can't smile...

558
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,920
That's what I do.

559
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,190
(He confessed how he behaves
unintentionally.)

560
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,000
I thought
you were talking about yourself.

561
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
- He's similar to me.
- Exactly. I was surprised.

562
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
(The 2nd son lost
in the fight for a good subsidiary.)

563
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,540
Tell me how many shares I have.

564
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,360
Soonbak Lodging has...

565
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,930
(No one wanted Soonbak Lodging.
How many shares does it have?)

566
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,250
eighteen percent.

567
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,220
(Soonbak Lodging Shares: 18 percent)

568
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,440
I knew it.

569
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,820
(Soonbak Lodging turns out to be
a hidden treasure!)

570
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,020
I knew it.

571
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,650
I knew it.

572
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,030
- Hey.
- He can't hide his emotion.

573
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,090
- He got a lot.
- He's pretending he's disappointed.

574
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,530
- Stop pretending you're upset.
- He's pretending.

575
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,260
- Okay.
- I can tell he's so happy now.

576
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,270
- I bet he got a lot of shares.
- Jae Suk.

577
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,360
- That's unexpected.
- He's elated.

578
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,930
I think he got about 20 percent.

579
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,040
Usually, the front six teeth show
when he smiles.

580
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,710
- But ten of them are showing now.
- Go ahead, Shin Rok.

581
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,780
- My gosh.
- I bet he got a lot of shares.

582
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,050
- Did you get a lot of shares?
- I'm sure he did.

583
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,710
- I made it.
- Did you?

584
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,440
I see that Father...

585
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
- My goodness. Why did Father...
- hid the shares here.

586
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,750
What's with his tone?

587
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,410
Why are you speaking
in an arrogant tone suddenly?

588
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,880
- "Father..."
- "Father..."

589
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,560
"This is where Father hid those."

590
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,230
- His tone doesn't match his outfit.
- Soonbak Investment.

591
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,590
(Next is Soonbak Electronics,
which she went through hoops to get.)

592
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,260
Soonbak Electronics has...

593
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,660
(Soonbak Electronics)

594
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,730
Oh, my. Should I take this with me?

595
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,240
You received one R coin
per percent stock share.

596
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,070
- So 1 coin is worth 1 percent?
- Correct.

597
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Do I really have...

598
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,930
(Does Soonbak Electronics own
a high share ratio as expected?)

599
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,740
- Shin Rok is back already.
- That was quick.

600
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,600
- She's carrying it with her.
- She's carrying it with her?

601
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,340
- Shouldn't I? Oh, I should hide it.
- She brought it with her.

602
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,050
- It's okay, Shin Rok.
- I brought mine too.

603
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,440
I bet she only has a few coins.

604
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,750
- Oh, she didn't get many shares.
- I think she has 3 or 4 coins.

605
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,940
- Her pouch looks thin.
- Right.

606
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,610
- I should've hidden it.
- I could tell at a glance.

607
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,910
- No, that's not the case.
- Soonbak Electronics isn't so good.

608
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,730
I could just tell.

609
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,380
- She has 4 or 5 coins.
- I see. Okay.

610
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,350
I know how many she has. Okay.

611
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,960
- No, you're wrong.
- Okay. Got it.

612
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,890
- Good. I got you.
- Where should hide my pouch?

613
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
- Jong Kook went there earlier.
- I see.

614
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,160
(The rest of the members have
checked their shares as well.)

615
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,830
Soonbak Daily's shares...

616
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,860
- Yes.
- You have...

617
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,010
(Soonbak Entertainment, Soonbak
Daily, Soonbak Cultural Foundation)

618
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,780
Today, we're going to decide
which of the eight siblings...

619
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,750
will be the successor
of Soonbak Group.

620
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,320
It's Reborn Spitefully Rich.

621
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,910
- Oh, I see.
- You have to get...

622
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,880
as many shares as you can
to increase your chances...

623
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,440
- of becoming the successor.
- Yes.

624
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,080
The number of shares you hold
at the end of the race...

625
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,960
will determine the number of boxes
your name is written in.

626
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,230
We'll choose two numbers...

627
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,120
to choose the chairman
and the vice chairman.

628
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,300
The two of them will receive
different prizes.

629
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,360
You can obtain more shares through
general shareholders' meetings...

630
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,090
- or in missions.
- Yes.

631
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,570
The team that wins in a mission...

632
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,900
gets to take four percent
of the losing team's shares.

633
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,540
- My, that's a great benefit.
- Indeed.

634
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,430
Before each mission,

635
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,840
you will team up with the siblings
you want.

636
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,140
The person with the most shares
on each team...

637
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,750
- will be the major shareholder.
- I see.

638
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,940
I said the winning team
got to take four percent, right?

639
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,020
- Yes.
- The major shareholder will...

640
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,320
choose who they will take it from.

641
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,580
- Really?
- Yes.

642
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,460
That means that after one game,
someone could...

643
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,030
Someone will go broke at once.

644
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,460
In other words,

645
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,970
someone will be forced out
on the street.

646
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,030
Someone could go broke at once?
Okay.

647
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,390
- I want to be a major shareholder.
- Before we begin the first mission,

648
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,710
you'll be divided into
2 teams of 4 members.

649
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,510
For your information,
in the first mission,

650
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,600
the total number of shares held
by the members of each team...

651
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,170
will determine the winning team.

652
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,710
- The more shares, the better.
- Yes, the team with more shares...

653
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,340
- The team with more shares?
- The team with more shares wins.

654
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,400
Just like that?

655
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,990
(There's always a factional dispute
in a conglomerate family.)

656
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,910
(Join forces with the sibling
who's at an advantage.)

657
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,990
Let's leave Shin Rok out.

658
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,060
- Let's leave her out.
- That's a good idea.

659
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,680
- We'll leave you out, Shin Rok.
- That's a good idea. Seriously.

660
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
- We shouldn't team up with her.
- I swear.

661
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,060
Shin Rok, is that a good idea?

662
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,350
It's a good idea.

663
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,620
- I bet she only has a few coins.
- I know.

664
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,500
- I have an idea.
- I have quite a lot.

665
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,240
Since Shin Rok is our guest,
for the first mission,

666
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,970
let's let her choose
her team members.

667
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,040
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

668
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,660
- If she chooses 3 members,
- She'll pick 4 members. Oh, right.

669
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,510
- the rest four will team up.
- Let's do that.

670
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,540
- I think that's for the best.
- Okay.

671
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,100
- Just follow your hunch.
- Okay.

672
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,840
- To pick the ones with many shares.
- Yes.

673
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,020
Is Soonbak Entertainment doing well?

674
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,050
Yes, it's not bad.

675
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,640
I think
she has quite a lot of shares.

676
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,020
- She picked So Min.
- Her first choice was So Min.

677
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,720
- How's yours?
- You won't be disappointed.

678
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,790
What about you?

679
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:46,260
I have quite a lot,
but I don't want to join your team.

680
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,300
- I pick Haha.
- Why?

681
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,770
I think you have many shares.

682
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,270
(Shin Rok chose Haha.)

683
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,510
- It's good enough.
- Okay.

684
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,270
- Ten teeth showed when you smiled.
- When I smiled?

685
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,370
I'm bad at hiding my emotions.

686
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,480
Then I choose Jae Suk.

687
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,640
- Okay.
- I see.

688
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,370
She didn't even ask me and Se Chan.

689
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,280
- I already chose three members.
- Right.

690
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
- Do you have many shares?
- Yes.

691
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,220
- Okay. She's made her decision.
- Okay.

692
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,610
- You're divided into two teams now.
- Yes.

693
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,880
- Which team has more shares?
- Here go each team's total shares.

694
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,920
- Each team's total shares?
- Okay. Tell us.

695
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,150
The teams that were just decided,
right?

696
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,350
The cutline is 35 percent, right?

697
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,350
Our team has...

698
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,350
Soonbak Daily,
Soonbak Cultural Foundation,

699
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,000
Soonbak Lodging,
and Soonbak Electronics.

700
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,160
What a mess.

701
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,630
- Soonbak Lodging...
- That's a mess.

702
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,630
- and Soonbak Cultural Foundation.
- Soonbak Cultural Foundation.

703
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,830
I'm confused about the identity
of this group.

704
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,010
If we have more than 35 percent,
we'll win.

705
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,980
- Out of 70 percent.
- Right.

706
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,550
(Current shares)

707
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,320
(Shin Rok made a good choice.)

708
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
- She picked the right members.
- I said I had quite a lot.

709
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,250
As a result, Team A wins.

710
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,320
- We must be bad at hiding emotions.
- That's great.

711
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,220
- Almost twice as much as we have.
- They have a lot of shares.

712
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,580
One of them must have
more than ten percent.

713
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,330
- Right. I'm sure that's the case.
- Yes.

714
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,420
The major shareholders
of the two teams are...

715
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,860
(Is it Soonbak Electronics
or Soonbak Lodging?)

716
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,070
Team Shin Rok's
major shareholder is...

717
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,040
- Jae Suk.
- I knew it.

718
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,710
(Current shares: Jae Suk 18,
Shin Rok 11, Haha 10, So Min 9)

719
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,430
(Who is the major shareholder
of the losing team?)

720
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,640
(How many shares
do Ji Hyo and Se Chan have?)

721
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,870
And Team Suk Jin's
major shareholder is Jong Kook.

722
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,780
(FC Soonbak, Kim Jong Kook)

723
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,380
- Me? Are you sure?
- He must have very few.

724
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,220
I'm the major shareholder?

725
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,580
- They have less than ten percent.
- This is a total mess.

726
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,330
- What?
- My business is not so bad.

727
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,920
My gosh. They have so few shares.

728
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,190
Jae Suk, you can take four percent
from anyone on the other team...

729
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,500
- and decide how to distribute it.
- Yes.

730
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,430
But you can't have all of it.
You must pick at least two members.

731
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,130
- I must share it with someone else?
- But...

732
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,830
- It's only the first mission.
- You have to share it.

733
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,240
- I knew he had a lot of shares.
- Someone will go broke.

734
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,250
Clean one of us out.

735
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,600
- I think Suk Jin will go broke.
- He'll go broke at once.

736
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
- I...
- Suk Jin will go broke at once.

737
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,020
- I think so too.
- I'll take Seok Sam's shares.

738
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,290
- Hey.
- I've made my choice.

739
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,060
- I bet he's broke now.
- I'll take his shares.

740
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,060
- How could you?
- I think...

741
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,220
- I think he lost all of his shares.
- I think so.

742
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,830
- Come on, brother.
- Listen, brother.

743
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,120
- I'm your elder brother.
- He's broke now.

744
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,420
Just relax and enjoy yourself
for the rest of your life.

745
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,120
- That's nonsense.
- Suk Jin.

746
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,740
- They have more shares than I do.
- You should...

747
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,500
- It's fun to watch them arguing.
- just go on trips now.

748
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,540
- Hey!
- I'll pay for everything.

749
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,130
- You'll take four percent?
- Yes.

750
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,040
- You took four percent from him.
- Yes.

751
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,550
Choose the members
you want to share it with.

752
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,840
- Jae Suk.
- Will you reveal everything?

753
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,550
I wish our team had won.

754
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,870
- Jae Suk, help me out.
- Since it was Shin Rok...

755
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,880
who formed our team,
I'll give her one percent.

756
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,580
I'll give Shin Rok one percent.

757
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,150
- I bet he'll keep the rest.
- She's smiling at him.

758
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,260
- My goodness. Her face.
- Look at her.

759
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,420
What's with that face?

760
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,030
- She's smiling at Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

761
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,690
I haven't been able to pay
the building maintenance fee.

762
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,330
- All of the artists left my agency.
- Jae Suk.

763
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,970
I won't ever ask for your help again
if you help me out this once.

764
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,630
- I want to say the same thing.
- Trust me.

765
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,740
Is your entertainment agency
struggling a lot?

766
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,170
Yes, indeed.

767
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,550
She's dating an idol singer,
you know.

768
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,750
She brought it upon herself.

769
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,870
- He's dating the agency owner?
- Haha.

770
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,820
The idol singer is dating the owner
of the agency he works with.

771
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,220
- Haha. Let me explain.
- You're supposed to work with him.

772
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,760
- You should work with him. Why...
- I mean...

773
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
- Why are you dating him?
- Well, right now...

774
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,620
- Hey. She's dating...
- It's not like that.

775
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,150
- You should work with him.
- She's dating an idol singer?

776
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,530
- He's an experienced idol singer.
- Hey.

777
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,330
- I asked you not to tell anyone.
- Why would she date him?

778
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,120
- And not long ago,
- It's ridiculous.

779
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,970
Ji Hyo stopped an article about it
from being published not long ago.

780
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,600
- I mean...
- You stopped the article for me.

781
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
- You should be grateful to me.
- I know.

782
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,130
Since it's so complicated,

783
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,010
- I'll have the rest three percent.
- Jae Suk!

784
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,210
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk!

785
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,320
- Didn't you know he'd do that?
- I promise I'll never do it again.

786
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,370
He must have a lot of shares now.

787
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,940
- Jae Suk.
- That's not all. Hey.

788
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,760
Just because
we have different mothers,

789
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,120
you can't treat me like that.
I mean... Right.

790
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
(Surprised)

791
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,150
- Honestly...
- Hey, I saw Shin Rok...

792
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,000
- She looked like this.
- She was surprised.

793
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,390
- I didn't know that until today.
- And...

794
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,970
- It's different in dramas.
- They have different mothers.

795
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,000
- Did everyone else know that?
- They usually have different dads.

796
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,540
I didn't know either
because Dad kept it from me.

797
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,740
Jae Suk,
you don't do that to your family.

798
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,040
You should share everything
with your family.

799
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,870
Hey, he just took all of my shares
when we're family.

800
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,250
I'm dirt broke now because of him.

801
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,580
- He could've chosen someone else.
- Suk Jin.

802
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,140
- He could've chosen Muscle.
- Go on trips...

803
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,580
- He holds a lot of shares.
- You can just go on trips now.

804
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,720
- I don't have a lot.
- Enjoy your life.

805
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,790
- I was surprised to know...
- Go on trips.

806
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,830
I was so surprised.

807
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,300
Go on trips and enjoy yourself
for the rest of your life.

808
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,800
You have distributed the shares
that you obtained.

809
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,500
The general shareholders' meeting
will begin shortly. Before that,

810
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,240
- please change your clothes.
- Got it.

811
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,540
- That was hilarious.
- Rich people stay rich forever.

812
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,980
- I have so few shares.
- I thought I picked the worst.

813
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,840
- Is it warm, Jae Suk?
- Yes, it's warm.

814
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,980
- Is it warm?
- Yes.

815
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,220
My, this is good.
There's nothing like...

816
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,820
- a cup of hot...
- You're taking herbal medicine.

817
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,790
A cup of hot Americano
makes me happy.

818
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,790
Life is simple.
If I can afford to have a cup of coffee...

819
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,380
- and three meals a day...
- Really?

820
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,150
and have a home to keep me warm,
that'd be good enough.

821
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,060
Then why do you always check
real estate prices?

822
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,530
- Hey.
- To make the most profit.

823
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,230
- I mean, it doesn't make sense.
- He's a liar.

824
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,730
If you think you don't need much...

825
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,330
- I feel empty.
- to keep yourself happy,

826
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,160
- why would you check the prices?
- I feel empty. That's why.

827
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,040
Before the next mission,

828
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,170
you will attend
the general shareholders' meeting.

829
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,330
- Okay.
- Yes.

830
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,740
(The 1st
general shareholders' meeting)

831
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,080
(The ones
who influence stock market prices)

832
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,870
At the venue,

833
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,870
- you'll see 40 pinatas.
- Pinatas?

834
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,940
In each pinata,
there's a random percentage of shares...

835
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,680
out of the 30 percent of shares
held by minority shareholders.

836
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,990
- I really should get some shares.
- Yes, you should.

837
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,620
When you break open a pinata,

838
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,270
if there are shares in the pinata,
you can choose Go or Stop.

839
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,000
If you find shares
in all the pinatas you open,

840
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,540
you get all the shares you found.

841
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,770
But in some pinatas,
there's flour instead of shares.

842
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,280
If you open one of those,
you should pay a fine of two percent...

843
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,640
- out of your shares.
- But you know my personality.

844
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,340
I would keep going no matter what.

845
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,110
- I know. He wouldn't stop.
- Me too. I wouldn't stop either.

846
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,140
- I'd stop if I get a good one.
- Of course.

847
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,720
If you get floured
after opening several pinatas,

848
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,490
- What happens to those shares?
- the fine of two percent...

849
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,530
- and the shares you got before...
- We lose all of those shares?

850
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,380
- We'll lose the shares.
- will be moved to another pinata.

851
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,920
- Really?
- I'll choose Go to the end.

852
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,620
That could make another pinata
a jackpot.

853
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,090
I see. It'd be great
if I go last and hit the jackpot.

854
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,240
To attend
the general shareholders' meeting,

855
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,540
you must hold
more than 15 percent of the shares.

856
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,930
- What?
- I see.

857
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,400
- We have to gather our shares.
- I don't have enough shares to go.

858
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,740
If you're not qualified
to attend the meeting,

859
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,900
you can gather shares
with other members.

860
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,750
- We still won't have enough shares.
- Not many of us...

861
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,020
- can attend the meeting.
- We have only 18 percent now.

862
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,790
- Suk Jin is broke already.
- Even if we gather our shares...

863
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,410
The eldest son gets one chance...

864
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,180
to attend
a general shareholders' meeting...

865
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,920
- alone.
- Really?

866
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,030
- I'm the eldest son, you know.
- Only Suk Jin gets the chance?

867
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,530
- I'm the eldest son.
- Only the eldest son?

868
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,160
- Those of you who want to attend...
- Can we go now?

869
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,730
Yes, you can go and play the game.

870
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,770
- Really?
- I think Jae Suk can go alone.

871
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,270
- Right?
- Go and have some fun.

872
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,810
- He must have more than 15 percent.
- I hope you get floured.

873
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,980
- Then I'll...
- Okay. Go ahead.

874
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,430
- I'll go alone.
- Okay.

875
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,870
- He's going alone? My gosh.
- He's going alone.

876
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,940
- Oh, he...
- Are you going alone?

877
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,320
I hope you go broke. I really do.

878
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,250
- I'll hit some pinatas.
- Okay.

879
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,520
I hope to see you covered in flour.

880
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,020
- See you later.
- It looks like...

881
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,320
Oh, yes.

882
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,380
(The one who's 1st in rank
walks confidently.)

883
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,150
Let's go hit some pinatas.

884
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,420
(The one who's 1st in rank
walks confidently.)

885
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,620
This is it. Where is it?

886
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,000
- You hold more than 15 percent.
- Yes.

887
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,530
- You're qualified to be here.
- That's right.

888
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,040
Please enter the conference room.

889
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Yes. Thank you.

890
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,080
(10 out of the 40 pinatas have
flour in them.)

891
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,400
- You chose number one.
- Yes.

892
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,940
(He chose number 1.)

893
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,750
I'll open it. One, two.

894
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,720
(Will he get lucky this time again?)

895
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,790
(1 percent)

896
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,820
One percent?

897
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,610
(It's not a lot.)

898
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,530
Congratulations.
You obtained one percent.

899
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,060
Would you like to choose Go or Stop?

900
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,390
I choose Go no matter what.

901
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,330
I never choose to stop.
I keep going forward no matter what.

902
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,860
Okay. Let's try again. Number two!

903
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,630
I'll start.

904
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,540
(He chose number 2
right next to the pinata he opened.)

905
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,600
One, two.

906
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,400
Oh, no. Zero percent?

907
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,440
Yes, but you didn't get floured,
so you can keep going if you want.

908
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,720
(Since he didn't get floured,
he can keep trying!)

909
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,910
- Then would you like to go with me?
- Take me with you.

910
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,110
Sure. But what about him?

911
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,150
I'll leave him here.

912
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,320
Really? I see. Okay.

913
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
- Wait.
- I won't go with you.

914
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,580
- Can we go with them too?
- Do you have enough shares?

915
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,960
- I can choose one of them, right?
- Yes, you can.

916
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,060
- Really? Haha, I lied.
- I didn't know that.

917
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,590
- I was just...
- She said she lied.

918
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,120
- Don't go back on your word.
- It's not like that.

919
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
She's our guest.

920
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
She was just trying to help me.

921
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,860
- Because she's our guest.
- Sorry?

922
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,330
She's our guest. So what?

923
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,630
Hey, I have an idea.

924
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,770
- We see each other every week.
- Hey.

925
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,280
- The meeting...
- Go with me and two more members.

926
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,330
- Including you? Why should I?
- I don't want that either.

927
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,640
- Why should I do that?
- It's my loss. I won't go with you.

928
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,080
Shin Rok, let's go together.

929
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,220
You two have 15 percent?

930
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,980
- If we gather our shares.
- Do you really have enough shares?

931
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,220
- Well, my shares alone...
- I have nine percent.

932
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,250
- What percentage is yours?
- Oh, my.

933
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,610
It's a secret.
Should I tell you that?

934
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,060
Do we have enough shares
to attend the meeting?

935
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,120
- Yes, we do if we combine ours.
- Okay. Then let's go.

936
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,000
- The teams don't matter?
- Of course.

937
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,620
- I'm not sure.
- We'll know when we get there.

938
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,230
- They teamed up together.
- Oh, they...

939
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,540
Hey, do you guys have 15 percent
if you combine your shares?

940
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,930
Let them go.
I'm sure they'll get floured.

941
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:51,970
I'm sure of that.

942
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,630
They're like trains with no brakes.

943
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,240
You're right.
They don't know when to stop.

944
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
(While the sisters and brothers
formed their alliances...)

945
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,870
(Jae Suk chose Go again.)

946
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,340
I'll pick the number in the middle.
I'll go with number 11.

947
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,610
- I picked a dud.
- Pull it down.

948
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,080
Oh, is this how we play the game?

949
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,720
Pull it down.

950
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,680
- What?
- He got more shares again?

951
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,680
- I picked zero percent again. Gosh.
- He might pick all the good ones.

952
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,590
- Gosh, seriously.
- He might open all the good ones?

953
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,150
I'll open one more.

954
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,830
(He might break open
all the pinatas.)

955
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,090
Okay. Number 30!

956
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,540
(This is his 4th attempt.)

957
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,660
I'm ready. One, two.

958
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,860
- I hope it's a dud.
- Zero percent.

959
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,240
- He picked zero percent.
- My gosh. Zero again?

960
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,280
(He got no shares 3 times in a row.)

961
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,250
Are you sure you put as many shares
as you should in the pinatas?

962
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,080
I opened 4 pinatas,
but I got only 1 percent. It's not fair.

963
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,250
- Jae Suk, choose Go.
- Go!

964
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,750
(Keep going
until you hit the jackpot!)

965
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,820
It's about time I hit the jackpot.
I'll go with number 26.

966
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,990
- A number in the middle.
- Until we hit the jackpot.

967
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,530
Let's keep going
until we hit the jackpot too.

968
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,920
Because we have to share it.

969
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,330
- It's hard to share one percent.
- Right.

970
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,230
(What's in number 26?)

971
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,000
- It's zero percent.
- Darn it!

972
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,330
(Again?)

973
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,240
(He keeps picking out the ones
with 0 percent.)

974
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,800
He picked them all out.

975
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

976
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,160
- Thank you.
- He's helping us.

977
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,430
- I picked 4 of them in a row.
- Pick out 1 more for us.

978
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,280
- One more!
- One more!

979
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,820
- Okay. I'll open one more.
- Okay.

980
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,870
- You're the man.
- I'll go with number 21.

981
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,840
(He's unstoppable like a tiger moth
darting into a fire.)

982
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,650
- Get floured.
- Get floured.

983
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,850
- One percent.
- Oh, he got one percent.

984
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,960
Okay. I got one percent.
I'll stop here.

985
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,350
- Would you like to choose Stop?
- I choose Stop.

986
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,760
- Got it.
- Okay.

987
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,500
Shin Rok and I will participate.

988
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,770
This isn't easy.

989
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,830
Thank you.

990
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,660
The pension owner knows how to play.

991
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,860
The pension owner.

992
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,400
Pick one of them. A number.

993
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,330
Is there a lucky number you like?

994
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,750
No,
but there's ten percent in this one.

995
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,580
- Really? Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

996
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,050
I hope they get a flour bomb.

997
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,020
Pull it.

998
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,990
In 1, 2.

999
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,880
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1000
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,650
In 1, 2, 3.

1001
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,650
I think it's flour.

1002
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,500
Pull it.

1003
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,630
(Dud)

1004
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,930
I didn't expect that.

1005
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,310
Hey.

1006
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,840
- My gosh.
- I'm sorry.

1007
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,810
- Hey.
- Jeon So Bal!

1008
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,950
- You two failed...
- Shin Rok!

1009
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,980
to acquire your share.

1010
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,220
- How did you pick that one?
- Okay!

1011
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,680
- You failed!
- You failed!

1012
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,320
Please pay the fine...

1013
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,680
- with two percent of your share.
- Each of you should give it to us.

1014
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,780
You failed.

1015
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,830
- You failed.
- You failed.

1016
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,990
- I'm sorry.
- You failed.

1017
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,300
- You failed.
- You failed.

1018
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,800
- You failed.
- I should've changed my mind.

1019
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Okay.

1020
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,660
I mean...

1021
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,100
- Each of you should give them two.
- Right now?

1022
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,370
Shin Rok is unlucky as well.

1023
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,700
- How did she...
- Shin Rok.

1024
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,950
- You're really unlucky.
- No. I will win.

1025
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,800
Out of so many of them,
how could you...

1026
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,410
Jae Suk opened five,

1027
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,850
- he didn't get a dud at least.
- That must've been our worst.

1028
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,890
- We... It might be me.
- The two...

1029
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,390
Many of them
could have flour, right?

1030
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,890
Okay. Let's go with number 14.

1031
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,550
- Number 13. Yes.
- Number 13?

1032
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,890
All right.

1033
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,930
(The youngest chooses number 13.)

1034
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,870
Fail.

1035
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,660
(The owner of the pension ruins it
even before it begins.)

1036
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,410
Fail.

1037
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:11,870
- Success.
- Fail.

1038
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,640
- Fail.
- Fail.

1039
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,510
(The classy eldest daughter
joins them.)

1040
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,550
(She got used to Running Man.)

1041
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,180
- Success.
- Success.

1042
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,890
(They got competitive
with the ritual battle.)

1043
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,640
Fail.

1044
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,050
- Fail.
- Number 13.

1045
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,120
Pull the string to see the result.

1046
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,220
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1047
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,390
Get a dud.

1048
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,280
- Get a dud.
- Get a dud, please.

1049
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,930
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1050
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,830
Flour. Yes!

1051
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,660
(It's a dud.)

1052
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,030
You failed.

1053
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,240
- You failed to acquire your share.
- You failed.

1054
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,200
Give us two percent of your share.

1055
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,700
(Each of them should pay the fine
with 2 percent of their share.)

1056
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,370
- I'm so excited.
- Later, the remaining pinatas...

1057
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,640
- Jae Suk, you did amazing.
- What?

1058
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,970
I did amazing.

1059
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,050
How did you do it?

1060
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,120
Let's go.

1061
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,410
- Can we not try again?
- This is nice.

1062
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,120
I'm excited.

1063
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,680
Okay. He is coming.

1064
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,430
- I can tell from his expression.
- He sounds quite happy.

1065
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,390
- Didn't you get the flour bomb?
- No, I didn't.

1066
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,990
I opened about six pinatas.

1067
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,760
- Did you get shares every time?
- Really?

1068
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,030
- No way.
- You didn't get a flour bomb?

1069
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,140
No, I didn't

1070
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,300
- You're amazing.
- So you should try it quickly.

1071
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,370
- I mean he's...
- Should I do it quickly?

1072
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,530
Shin Rok got a flour bomb.

1073
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,330
- She got it.
- Yes, I did.

1074
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,430
Jae Suk isn't usually lucky,

1075
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,050
but he's lucky this time.

1076
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,350
Shin Rok turned out
to be an unlucky one too.

1077
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,740
- As soon as she picked it...
- So I should do it next time.

1078
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,820
I had a good feeling, though.

1079
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,050
Look at her.

1080
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,010
You look good.

1081
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,950
- It serves you right.
- We should get it next time.

1082
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,780
- This is why we play this game.
- It serves you right.

1083
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,680
I was crushed.

1084
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,800
- Gosh.
- At once.

1085
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,430
So Min looks like she got
more flour than anyone else.

1086
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,870
I'm sorry. I'm unlucky.

1087
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,490
This is good.

1088
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,570
Another mission will begin.

1089
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,930
The heirs and heiresses
should have knowledge in many areas.

1090
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,910
- It's about common sense.
- I'm doomed.

1091
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,200
- So...
- It's advanced common sense, right?

1092
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,780
- It is advanced common sense.
- Okay.

1093
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,010
It's advanced common sense.

1094
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,680
Yes.
The mission we prepared this time...

1095
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,640
is Conglamorate Family Quiz Class.

1096
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,050
One of them will guess the answer...

1097
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,620
and three of them
will give them hints.

1098
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,350
- It will work then. Shin Rok...
- One of us will guess the answer?

1099
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,720
- That's okay.
- After seeing the word given by us,

1100
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,330
the three of you should write
a word related to the answer...

1101
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,140
- to give a hint.
- Okay.

1102
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,370
- Gosh.
- Each of us?

1103
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,600
Hey.

1104
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,010
- But we should know the answer.
- Can we write a random word?

1105
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,910
- Why don't you come this way?
- Let's go.

1106
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,010
Who will go first?

1107
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,050
Before we decided
who will go first...

1108
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,620
- Yes.
- We will order delivery after this.

1109
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,820
Delivery sounds good.

1110
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,410
We'll order what the major shareholders
from each team want.

1111
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,850
We'll discuss it.

1112
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,580
- Let's have noodles.
- Let's have something healthy.

1113
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,760
- How about salad?
- Bossam?

1114
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,160
- Salad sounds good. It's healthy.
- Pork cutlet.

1115
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,430
- Or a sandwich.
- Let's have Korean food.

1116
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,800
I'm sorry, but the two of us...

1117
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,890
- will decide.
- I want pork cutlet.

1118
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,830
(Lifting)

1119
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,240
- What do you want to have?
- What do you want?

1120
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,430
- What do you want, Jong Kook?
- What do you want?

1121
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,330
- I'll have what you want.
- What should we have?

1122
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,910
How does bossam sound?

1123
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,430
- Something nutritious or...
- Incorrect.

1124
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,100
I know a place that has
delicious braised short ribs.

1125
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,200
- Incorrect.
- That's a no.

1126
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,370
- Fried rice.
- Fried rice is...

1127
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,510
If it's incorrect,
that means there's a correct answer.

1128
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,640
Tell us.

1129
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,820
- It means he thought of something.
- Say what you want.

1130
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,910
I want braised short ribs too.

1131
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,010
- Incorrect.
- Braised short ribs.

1132
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,180
Seolleongtang.

1133
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,660
Seolleongtang?

1134
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,330
Gamjatang.

1135
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,990
- Seolleongtang doesn't sound bad.
- I did it.

1136
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,950
- How about you, Shin Rok?
- Sundaegukbap.

1137
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,030
- Bossam.
- Bossam?

1138
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,160
Bossam is incorrect.

1139
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,370
Then what do you want to have?

1140
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,530
What do you want?

1141
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,910
- What do you want?
- Shin Rok.

1142
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,010
- I'm the major shareholder.
- What do you want to have?

1143
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,680
- I... Wait.
- I'm so curious.

1144
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,550
- The weather is quite cold.
- It's cold.

1145
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,780
Because it's cold...

1146
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,470
- What do you want?
- I'm sure he will say kalguksu.

1147
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,640
- Seolleongtang?
- It's 100 percent noodles.

1148
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,910
- How about jjamppong?
- Come on.

1149
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,620
You always have
either ramyeon or jjamppong.

1150
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,720
- How about jjamppong?
- Come on.

1151
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,260
You always have
either ramyeon or jjamppong.

1152
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,050
- He's right.
- I want to have something else.

1153
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,160
- I always feel bloated on Monday.
- Okay. Give me a suggestion again.

1154
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,330
We only had noodles.
It drives me crazy.

1155
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,700
What about baeksuk?
It's famous around here.

1156
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,140
- Baeksuk.
- How about chicken bone soup?

1157
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,010
Chicken bone soup
or braised spicy chicken.

1158
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,030
But they...

1159
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,680
- Why? What about them?
- They're on a tight budget.

1160
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,870
- Right.
- The budget...

1161
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,300
- It's not a big difference.
- You pay for it then.

1162
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,550
Yes. That sounds good.

1163
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,180
- You pay for it.
- You're okay with it, right?

1164
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,820
Why don't you treat us to a meal
after a long time?

1165
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,050
- I can treat you, but...
- He can treat us.

1166
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,180
- He can treat us.
- He can treat us.

1167
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,450
I can treat you.

1168
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,260
- It's on me.
- Then it's on Suk Jin today.

1169
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,850
- It's on Suk Jin.
- My gosh.

1170
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,080
It's on me.

1171
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,330
- No.
- Sushi?

1172
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,390
- Let's have something simple today.
- Yes.

1173
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,490
- Jjamppong.
- Yes.

1174
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,870
Please. Just once.

1175
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,890
- I'm sick of it.
- I don't like it.

1176
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,430
- Why?
- I'll have mapo tofu, then.

1177
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,530
I want to have rice.

1178
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,010
- I'm sick of it.
- Just have the same one.

1179
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,700
I don't like Chinese food.

1180
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,140
Then have fried rice.
She wants to have fried rice.

1181
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,370
- Ji Hyo, are you okay with it?
- Fried rice.

1182
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,180
- Yes. Fried rice.
- How about you?

1183
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,280
- Rice.
- Jjamppong with seafood.

1184
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,320
I'll have rice too.

1185
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,550
- Raise your hand. Jjamppong rice.
- Rice.

1186
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,680
I'll have fried rice.

1187
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,390
- Jjamppong?
- Jjamppong.

1188
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,280
Don't order things like tangsuyuk.

1189
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,950
- Pleaser order tangsuyuk.
- No.

1190
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,080
- Why not?
- We won't finish it.

1191
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,120
- We won't finish tangsuyuk.
- Right.

1192
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,430
- That's not good.
- Let's just order one then.

1193
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,390
Shin Rok is here too.
Don't you want some tangsuyuk?

1194
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,930
- Will you not have tangsuyuk?
- You want it, right?

1195
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,990
You want to have tangsuyuk, right?

1196
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,600
- Will you not have tangsuyuk?
- You want it, right?

1197
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:07,800
- If you want it, just nod.
- Shin Rok, will you have tangsuyuk?

1198
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,910
- Say it comfortably.
- Tell us what you want, Shin Rok.

1199
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,100
Tangsuyuk...

1200
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,240
- That's a no.
- What's wrong with her?

1201
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,800
What's wrong with her?

1202
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,550
- What's wrong with her?
- Mister.

1203
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,740
Do you not want it?

1204
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,680
- You don't want tangsuyuk?
- Okay.

1205
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,320
- Shin Rok doesn't want it.
- No way.

1206
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,390
- Okay.
- "No way."

1207
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,510
Let us order fried dumplings
at least.

1208
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,890
- Let's have fried dumplings.
- Yes.

1209
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,430
Okay. We'll order them.
Which team will do the quiz?

1210
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,450
They'll go first.

1211
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,450
I want to see how it goes
with those who are good.

1212
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,700
Okay. Let's do it first.

1213
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,760
Even without
a professional explanation,

1214
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,890
- he might know.
- He would guess.

1215
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,910
- Is it hard?
- But I can't think of words easily.

1216
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,680
The first question
is about current affairs.

1217
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,030
- Current affairs.
- Current affairs.

1218
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,280
I'll show you. Go.

1219
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,010
(The first word is revealed.)

1220
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,740
(Financial Independence)

1221
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,740
This is...
They've seen it many times.

1222
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,280
I think they will know.

1223
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,820
(Financial Independence,
Retire Early movement)

1224
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,820
- One, two,
- They will know.

1225
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,350
- three,
- We've seen it many times.

1226
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,720
- I think they will know.
- four,

1227
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,950
five.

1228
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,100
- Hold up your hints.
- Times up?

1229
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,620
- Hold on.
- Even Haha knows it.

1230
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,370
- Hold up your hints.
- Are you done?

1231
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:12,140
- Hold on.
- Even Haha knows it.

1232
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,260
Show us.

1233
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,470
- Are you done?
- Hold on.

1234
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,260
(I was fired from my job,
Golden retirement, Fire family)

1235
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,530
What kind of retirement?

1236
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,700
Show us.

1237
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,530
What retirement?

1238
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,640
- Five.
- It's golden retirement.

1239
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,240
Four.

1240
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,580
- Three.
- Wait. The FIRE movement.

1241
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,680
(Correct)

1242
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,160
- Is "fire family" okay?
- "Fire family."

1243
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,850
- Is "fire family" acceptable?
- I mean...

1244
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,830
- The correct answer is FIRE.
- Is "fire family" okay?

1245
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,950
- "Fire family" is a little...
- I'm sorry, but...

1246
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,660
- What's "fire family?"
- What?

1247
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,720
Isn't this too direct?

1248
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,470
- "Fire family." "FIRE."
- FIRE is...

1249
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,300
It's not that fire,
but it's still fire.

1250
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Here...

1251
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,200
- "Fire."
- What's "fire family?"

1252
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,530
- The answer is all here.
- I'll be careful.

1253
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,910
But he didn't see it anyway.

1254
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,100
Why did you not look at me?

1255
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,300
But you know...

1256
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,740
- She's just a weak link.
- "A weak link."

1257
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,140
You should go easy on me too then.

1258
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,370
- We have a weak link too.
- Okay.

1259
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,490
It's Art and Culture this time.

1260
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,490
This one sounds easier.

1261
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,220
I'll show you.

1262
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,580
- Five,
- I know it.

1263
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,890
- four,
- I knew it.

1264
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:13,220
- three, two, one.
- I don't know what it means.

1265
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,220
Hold up your hints.

1266
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,800
- What is it?
- It's...

1267
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,070
Put it up.

1268
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,830
Hold up your hints.

1269
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,700
(Stone plate grilled)

1270
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,570
(A warm and strange hint)

1271
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,640
What is it?

1272
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,580
Stone plate grilled.

1273
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,970
Life is but a dream.

1274
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,780
(Hill, Life is but a dream)

1275
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,240
- But...
- Life is but a dream.

1276
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,450
- Four.
- Stone plate grilled.

1277
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,970
- Three.
- Stone plate grilled.

1278
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,280
Dream in the oven?

1279
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,450
- Stone plate grilled.
- Life is but a dream?

1280
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,410
- These hints are better.
- Dream in the oven?

1281
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,510
("The Cloud Dream of the Nine")

1282
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:44,180
These hints are better
if you know what it is.

1283
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,390
- Dream?
- Three,

1284
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,220
two, one.

1285
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,300
- Okay.
- What is that?

1286
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,620
"The Cloud Dream of the Nine."

1287
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,470
- "The Cloud Dream of the Nine."
- "The Cloud Dream of the Nine?"

1288
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,510
(The hints are useless.)

1289
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,640
- "The Cloud Dream of the Nine."
- "The Cloud Dream of the Nine?"

1290
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,830
Life is but a dream, hill.

1291
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,780
Why did you write
"stone plate grilled?"

1292
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,580
Because it's grilled.

1293
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,140
Don't look at hers.
She's just there for fun.

1294
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,890
Why would you write
"stone plate grilled?"

1295
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,850
That was the only word
that came to my mind.

1296
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,350
That's how you're going to play it?
Okay.

1297
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,850
- Because it's grilled.
- Yes.

1298
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,760
You can guess the answer now,
Shin Rok.

1299
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,350
- Me?
- Come here.

1300
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,760
- Yes. This could work.
- So frustrating. We can't draw.

1301
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,160
How does it become
"dream in the oven?"

1302
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,430
I'll give you the next word.

1303
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,760
It's about politics and economy.

1304
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,070
Politics and economy.

1305
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,640
It's politics and economy, Shin Rok.

1306
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,240
- This is difficult.
- I don't know anything.

1307
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,140
Don't look at So Min's hint.

1308
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,410
Haha.

1309
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,550
Start.

1310
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,010
(Santa Claus rally)

1311
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,180
(Santa Claus rally)

1312
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:50,390
(A calendar effect in which
stock prices rise around Christmas)

1313
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,950
(It's a difficult question.)

1314
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,570
This is an economic term.

1315
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:00,990
Three, two, one.

1316
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,260
(She just writes even though
she doesn't know the term.)

1317
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,470
Show us.

1318
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,600
What did you write?

1319
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,140
(Christmas continues)

1320
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:09,700
You can take off the eye patch.

1321
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,050
Christmas. Stocks.

1322
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,680
- I don't know.
- She doesn't know.

1323
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,120
- Christmas.
- Christmas.

1324
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,580
It's Christmas.

1325
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,680
- Christmas.
- Shin Rok.

1326
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,050
- It continues.
- Five, four,

1327
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,220
- It continues?
- three,

1328
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,430
Christmaaas.

1329
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,100
Christmas continues.

1330
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,220
- It continues?
- It continues.

1331
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,470
Christmaaas.

1332
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,160
Shin Rok!

1333
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,030
- Christmas.
- It's Santa Claus rally.

1334
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,140
- Am I doomed?
- It's so difficult.

1335
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,280
What did you mean
by Christmas continuing?

1336
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,640
- Santa rally.
- Rally.

1337
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,510
Rally meaning going and coming back.

1338
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,720
- But this is difficult.
- It's difficult.

1339
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,240
I'll show you.

1340
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,220
(Stock option)

1341
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,280
Five, four,

1342
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,080
three, two...

1343
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,760
- One. Show us.
- This one is easy.

1344
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,430
(It's an easy question.
Would we get useful hints?)

1345
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,200
This is a bit difficult.

1346
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,800
- Show us.
- This one is easy.

1347
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,970
(Stocks that you additionally get
on the side.)

1348
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,700
- Should I take it off?
- Yes. You can see the hints.

1349
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,080
(She checks the hints.)

1350
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,240
It's easy.

1351
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,800
What did you write?

1352
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,280
Detox?

1353
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,550
(She just used
similar-sounding words.)

1354
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,280
Haha's hint is easy.

1355
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,260
The right to buy stocks.

1356
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,450
Detox?

1357
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,660
Stock option.

1358
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,600
(Stock option)

1359
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,990
(She got "stock option" right
from the hints.)

1360
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,990
- Whose hint did you see?
- Detox.

1361
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:41,300
Detox? She got it right
after seeing "detox."

1362
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,300
You get it additionally on the side?

1363
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,640
- That's how you get it.
- It's the right to buy stocks.

1364
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,240
Black swan.

1365
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,700
(Shin Rok continues to get
the correct answers.)

1366
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,780
"Les Miserables."

1367
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,350
- That's right.
- Nice.

1368
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,950
- Kim Shin Rok.
- How do you know that?

1369
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,910
- Very good.
- That was good, Shin Rok.

1370
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,280
Seoul National University,
Department of Geography.

1371
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,820
Kim Shin Rok, the best
from the department of Geography.

1372
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,850
Great.

1373
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,430
- You're really good.
- Am I?

1374
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,850
It was so difficult.

1375
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,100
This is...

1376
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,430
- It's difficult.
- We...

1377
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,530
will do it like that.

1378
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,300
- I'll try to guess it.
- That's right.

1379
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,870
- I'll guess it.
- Focus on the first letter.

1380
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,570
- I'll guess it.
- Just ignore mine.

1381
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,370
Okay. I'll just guess it.

1382
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:19,970
We should phrase it well.

1383
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:21,330
Okay.

1384
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,370
- I don't want to eat jjamppong.
- Me too.

1385
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:25,580
I don't like Chinese food.

1386
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,720
I'm tired of it too.

1387
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,490
I ate it yesterday as well.

1388
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,620
If it was bossam...

1389
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,390
Jae Suk is looking at us.

1390
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:36,050
(The jjamppong lover
is glaring at them.)

1391
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,620
I can't digest it.

1392
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,660
Really?

1393
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,100
- Hyung In,
- Then...

1394
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,570
could you get us two seolleongtang?

1395
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:46,800
They want seolleongtang
because they can't digest it well.

1396
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,160
He doesn't want to eat jjamppong.

1397
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,410
He's 44 years old now.

1398
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,580
He could want to eat seolleongtang.

1399
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,830
We have Shin Rok with us today.

1400
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,850
She said she'll eat jjamppong.

1401
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,550
- She...
- She wanted bossam.

1402
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,680
That's right. She wanted bossam.

1403
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,970
When did she say that?

1404
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,220
You're the one who wanted bossam.

1405
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,640
- She wanted bossam.
- Do you want to eat bossam?

1406
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:05,850
(Exclaiming)

1407
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,280
Tell me if you want to eat bossam.

1408
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,450
It's okay.

1409
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,530
- See.
- He's the one who stopped her.

1410
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,430
(While the jjamppong haters
make a protest...)

1411
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,620
The first question is about economy.

1412
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,260
I'll show you.

1413
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,870
(The first question
is about economy.)

1414
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:21,760
Goodness, this is nuts.

1415
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,140
- This is...
- This is hard.

1416
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,930
- Four,
- I'll write.

1417
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,580
- This is hard.
- Four,

1418
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,280
- three,
- You know this, right?

1419
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,350
two, one.

1420
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,450
Show us.

1421
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:33,970
Let's see.

1422
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,240
Here.

1423
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,720
(North pole, bird)

1424
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,780
North pole.

1425
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,490
- Think about it one by one.
- You'd know if you know.

1426
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,820
- You know it.
- What did you write?

1427
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,760
A bird that lives on ice
and can't fly.

1428
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,490
It can't fly? Penguin?

1429
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,720
It can't fly.

1430
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,930
What is this question about?

1431
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,070
It's an effect.

1432
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:51,600
I'll give you five seconds.

1433
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,640
- It's very easy.
- Look at the sentence.

1434
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,700
- The one in your mind.
- Four,

1435
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,870
- It's correct?
- Yes.

1436
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,100
- It's easy.
- Penguin effect?

1437
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,660
Okay.

1438
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,740
(Penguin effect)

1439
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,930
(He guessed it right.)

1440
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,600
They shouldn't do it like this.

1441
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,280
You should explain what it is.

1442
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,680
- You should explain.
- Why should I?

1443
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,910
- I just need to say the answer.
- You should explain.

1444
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,580
You should explain the answer.

1445
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,950
- I just need to get it right.
- That's right.

1446
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:14,990
Penguin effect...

1447
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,330
is when people buy goods
after watching other people buy it.

1448
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,990
- That's right.
- Yes. You follow what others do.

1449
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,970
Penguins follow other penguins
like this.

1450
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,970
That's what it is.

1451
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,830
- "I'll buy it too."
- That's not what it is.

1452
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,260
When one penguin jumps into water,
the crowd also follows.

1453
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,430
That's right. That's what I meant.

1454
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,410
Then why did you imitate
how they walk?

1455
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,410
(He randomly walked cutely.)

1456
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,300
- He doesn't know the term.
- That's the penguin effect.

1457
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,200
- He got it right.
- Yes.

1458
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,970
I don't know economic terms.

1459
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,180
- I did okay, right?
- You did well.

1460
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,180
That was a good start.

1461
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,760
The next question
is about current events.

1462
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,320
- Current events?
- Current events.

1463
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,530
(Noblesse oblige)

1464
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,200
- This one is doable.
- But this one is...

1465
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,300
Two, one.

1466
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,930
It's what you don't keep at all.

1467
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,370
- Show us.
- Let's see.

1468
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,390
(Will he be able to keep his honor?)

1469
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:04,010
(Rich foreigner)

1470
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,070
(Exclaiming)

1471
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,780
This is what it is.

1472
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,080
Give?

1473
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:10,850
(A rich person giving
as fitting his class)

1474
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,050
(I know!)

1475
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,870
I'll give you five seconds.

1476
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,550
- Five, four,
- You know it, right?

1477
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:16,990
- three,
- It's easy.

1478
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,620
- It's not Buenos Aires.
- two,

1479
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,720
(Buenos Aires?)

1480
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,620
- It's noblesse oblige.
- Is this about capital cities?

1481
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,120
- Don't you know that?
- I know.

1482
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,620
I know, but I couldn't remember
what it was.

1483
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,070
Buenos Aires?
What is he talking about?

1484
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,870
He just said that to be funny.

1485
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,430
- Why Buenos Aires?
- You wanted to be funny, right?

1486
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,530
Noblesse...

1487
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,410
- You wanted to be funny.
- No, I didn't.

1488
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:40,640
You do it.

1489
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,530
- It's difficult.
- But you know more.

1490
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,410
I know noblesse oblige.

1491
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,580
Noblesse oblige.
But she counted down so suddenly.

1492
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,910
It made me nervous.

1493
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:54,450
What's Buenos?

1494
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,620
The capital city.

1495
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,080
Where? I don't know.

1496
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,220
- The capital city of Argentina.
- Argentina?

1497
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,600
(She learns something from this.)

1498
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,890
- I knew it was wrong. It just came.
- It's because...

1499
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,490
- Noblesse...
- It sounded similar.

1500
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,200
It was noblesse oblige.

1501
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,740
I'll show you.

1502
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,200
(Metaverse)

1503
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,140
Hold on.

1504
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,180
- Five, four,
- Okay.

1505
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,780
- three, two,
- Do you know it? Is it easy?

1506
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,050
- It's super easy.
- one.

1507
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,350
- Okay.
- Show us.

1508
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,050
- You should get it right.
- Lift them up.

1509
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,280
(You have to get it right.)

1510
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,390
- It's easy, right?
- I couldn't write the front part.

1511
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,320
(Where we invested)

1512
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,660
- You know this one.
- Metaverse!

1513
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,660
- That's right.
- Yes!

1514
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,620
(He got it right immediately.)

1515
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,890
We invested in metaverse.

1516
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,490
We invested in metaverse.

1517
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,220
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1518
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,200
Ji Hyo wrote, "Seoul Tayo Bus."

1519
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,570
(She really wrote that.)

1520
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,010
- Bus.
- Let's see.

1521
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,450
- Seoul Tayo Bus.
- Bus.

1522
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:52,140
- It's a bus.
- She used "bus."

1523
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,510
How could he not see Jong Kook's...

1524
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,240
and get it right
from "where we invested?"

1525
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,410
That's amazing.

1526
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,180
Where we invested. Metaverse.

1527
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:02,780
- Let's go.
- This one is about current events.

1528
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,680
- That's great.
- I'll show you the word.

1529
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:05,950
(Genome)

1530
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:06,950
Five,

1531
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,620
- Is it doable?
- This...

1532
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,970
- four, three,
- You should write it, Se Chan.

1533
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:13,740
two, one.

1534
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,240
(Ji Hyo confidently writes.)

1535
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,700
- Show us.
- What was that?

1536
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,640
Ji Hyo is awesome.

1537
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,350
Seriously.

1538
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,580
Your handwriting.

1539
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,620
Baby. What's that? Child?

1540
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,280
- What did you write?
- Child.

1541
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,490
Child?

1542
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,850
(Various words inspired
from the word "genome")

1543
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,080
This...

1544
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,600
That's right.

1545
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,720
(His hint is useless too.)

1546
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,220
- Project.
- It's germandeuk.

1547
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,330
- What?
- Five,

1548
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,030
(Germandeuk, Project This Brat,
That Brat, Baby Child)

1549
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,660
What? This is about current events?

1550
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,510
- That's right.
- "Ge" is the first word.

1551
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:51,530
Three.

1552
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:55,080
(He's the only one
Suk Jin can rely on.)

1553
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,050
- Geo...
- Wrong.

1554
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,970
- Genome.
- Genome.

1555
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,640
- Genome.
- That one is funny.

1556
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,140
No one said anything about genes.

1557
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,010
- Germandeuk.
- Genome.

1558
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,910
- No one wrote genes.
- Ji Hyo.

1559
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,080
There's something
called Project Genome, right?

1560
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,620
- Baby, child?
- Project Genome.

1561
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,350
It's correct.

1562
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:15,260
Genome. Baby, child, and genome?

1563
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,890
- That's right.
- This is crazy.

1564
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:17,970
Baby, child, genome.

1565
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,530
It goes in gradation.

1566
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,160
- It was a gradation.
- It was a gradation.

1567
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:24,260
- That's right.
- I totally understood.

1568
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,370
Shin Rok's team won.

1569
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,640
- Okay.
- My goodness.

1570
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,100
Okay.

1571
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,410
The major shareholder
of the winning team...

1572
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,280
can take four percent.

1573
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,280
That's nice.

1574
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,450
I thought we would win this time.

1575
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:40,490
- Seriously.
- I worked hard.

1576
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,760
- Don't worry.
- I am hungry.

1577
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,050
- Whose shares should I take?
- I only ate flour-based food.

1578
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,950
- This time...
- Jong Kook has the most.

1579
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,470
How about one percent
from each member?

1580
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:52,830
I will take one percent
from each member.

1581
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,800
- One percent? In that case,
- Yes.

1582
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,990
- give him one coin each.
- Thank you.

1583
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,010
- One coin each?
- Give me one coin each.

1584
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,640
- Now?
- Yes, give him one coin each.

1585
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,930
- One coin each?
- It's in my bag.

1586
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,300
Maybe Suk Jin doesn't have it.

1587
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:02,430
- Maybe he doesn't have it.
- One coin each?

1588
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,850
- Hey.
- Here you go.

1589
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,010
Well...

1590
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,010
(With 1 percent,
Suk Jin is close to bankruptcy.)

1591
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,320
- He is close to bankruptcy.
- What happens then?

1592
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,450
- Does he go home?
- You just participate in the games.

1593
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,140
I just participate in the games.
It doesn't mean anything.

1594
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,220
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1595
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,550
- Give me another one.
- Another one? Okay.

1596
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,580
He has one. He showed it to me.

1597
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,720
- It's Soonbak Group.
- Suk Jin, do you have a coin?

1598
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,430
Of course. The eldest son
has one more chance.

1599
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,720
It's my only coin.

1600
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,030
(Jong Kook submitted 1 percent
instead of the eldest son.)

1601
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,800
- One percent each.
- Thank you.

1602
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1603
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,260
Are we doing the pinata now?

1604
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,430
Jae Suk, do it.

1605
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,010
- We got it!
- We got it!

1606
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,410
Stay.

1607
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,450
One, two.

1608
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,580
(Se Chan and Jae Suk picked a dud
at a general shareholders' meeting.)

1609
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,410
(The eldest and the youngest
are close to bankruptcy.)

1610
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,640
(Soonbak News, the end)

1611
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,680
I will give you
the current shares...

1612
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,390
- of each team.
- Okay.

1613
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,530
Jong Kook's team has...

1614
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,930
- ten percent.
- What?

1615
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,530
(Their total is 10 percent.)

1616
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,100
(Their wealth became quite small.)

1617
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,930
Ten percent?

1618
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,570
- Where did my shares go?
- Ten percent?

1619
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,430
- My goodness.
- Ten percent?

1620
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:10,510
Hold on. Are you saying
these 4 have 10 percent?

1621
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,800
(1, 2, 1, and 6 percent)

1622
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,950
(They lost a lot of shares
at the meeting.)

1623
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,450
We need to stay together.

1624
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,680
I see that Jong Kook doesn't have
a lot of shares.

1625
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,490
I gave Jae Suk two coins earlier.

1626
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,280
Then we should mix up the members.

1627
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,530
If Jong Kook remains
the major shareholder,

1628
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,830
he will get coins.

1629
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,800
The other team has 57 percent.

1630
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,030
(Team A has 57 percent.)

1631
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,620
If you have
a moderate amount of shares,

1632
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,240
you will be the major shareholder
in this team.

1633
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,660
Totally.

1634
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,800
I have one last chance.
I have a benefit as the eldest son.

1635
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,030
- Father...
- You keep talking about it.

1636
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,580
- That lousy benefit.
- I am the eldest son.

1637
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,740
- Seriously.
- Father didn't give me shares.

1638
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,550
But he did give me an advantage.

1639
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,450
An advantage.

1640
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,850
The eldest son's advantage.

1641
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,410
- It's here.
- It's here. The food is here.

1642
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,120
- Jjamppong is the best in winter.
- Jjamppong is the best in winter.

1643
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,120
Look at the color. It's amazing.

1644
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,530
The soup looks delicious.

1645
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:03,200
I ordered seolleongtang for them.

1646
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:05,890
They have an upset stomach.

1647
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,890
Good job.

1648
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,530
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy the food.

1649
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,030
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the food.

1650
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:12,370
Do you even feel like eating?

1651
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:13,830
(Current shares: 1 percent)

1652
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,930
What? I need to eat.

1653
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:18,450
- Let's eat before work.
- That's right.

1654
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:20,010
Thank you for the food. Is it tasty?

1655
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,010
Yes.

1656
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:22,740
- Is it good?
- My goodness.

1657
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,740
(The noodle lover became happy.)

1658
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,910
It's so nice.

1659
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,660
(The noodle lover became happy.)

1660
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:29,260
- It's so tasty.
- Radish looks tasty.

1661
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,260
(The siblings of the Soonbak family
enjoy the 8-dollar jjamppong.)

1662
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,390
It's so tasty.

1663
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:33,550
- It isn't too far.
- It's nice.

1664
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:35,030
(The siblings of the Soonbak family
enjoy the 8-dollar jjamppong.)

1665
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,160
It's so tasty.

1666
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,530
It's really tasty.

1667
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:41,740
It's so tasty.

1668
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,200
Soup is the best in winter.

1669
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,240
- This is a nice restaurant.
- It's tasty.

1670
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,330
It's nice.

1671
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,930
Look at this. Father bought...

1672
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,450
- a big house.
- This place is so pretty.

1673
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:54,220
I didn't know such a place existed
in the backyard.

1674
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,050
I have lived here for 50 years,
but there are places I haven't been.

1675
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,180
- This place is nice.
- My goodness.

1676
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,910
- It's nice.
- Yes.

1677
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,030
Hold on. Let's stand
with our teammates.

1678
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,080
You guys...

1679
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,530
Team Beggars, go over there.

1680
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,720
- What? Team Beggars?
- Don't say that.

1681
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,100
- Don't say that.
- Don't say that.

1682
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,390
Please give us a chance to recover.

1683
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,890
- It's time for the second mission.
- Okay.

1684
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:17,800
It will be another team competition.

1685
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,030
Team up with members of your choice.

1686
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:22,830
- Shall we change things up?
- Shall we do that?

1687
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,740
Jae Suk, let's switch the members.

1688
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,240
- Let's do that.
- We should stay as we are.

1689
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,240
- That's right.
- They won't take too much from us.

1690
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,450
- Hold on.
- We need members with more shares.

1691
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,350
If we lose,
they will take coins from me only.

1692
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:34,660
- That might happen.
- Right?

1693
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,180
Of course,
they will take coins from you only.

1694
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,830
In the previous round,
I submitted one more coin.

1695
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,620
- Send us two beggars.
- That's right.

1696
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,120
We will send you two members.

1697
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,160
We became a team of beggars.

1698
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,390
- The beggars should go.
- Yes. Come over here.

1699
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:45,930
- Okay.
- Shin Rok, go over there.

1700
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:47,740
- Shin Rok.
- Shin Rok.

1701
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,100
- Haha should go.
- Even if I switch teams...

1702
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,160
- Right?
- We can do the pinata together.

1703
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,330
- Switch coats with me.
- We can still team up.

1704
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,470
- This is small.
- It's okay.

1705
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,850
- Stop picking on me.
- It's nice and tight.

1706
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,220
The team members have been decided.

1707
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,320
As a result,

1708
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,490
Team A's major shareholder
is Jae Suk.

1709
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,780
- You can't beat him.
- Move back.

1710
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,280
- Team B's major shareholder is...
- Haha.

1711
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,720
- Haha.
- Is it you?

1712
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,030
- It's him.
- Look at you guys.

1713
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,430
I knew it would be him.

1714
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,430
- I came to save the team.
- Yes.

1715
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:21,430
- Save the team.
- Team A has 36 percent...

1716
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,470
- and Team B has 31 percent.
- Okay.

1717
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,100
- It's neck and neck.
- What?

1718
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,140
- The shares are similar now.
- Okay.

1719
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,330
Then the two of them...

1720
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:30,050
- Then the two of them...
- Why did you give them the total?

1721
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,580
Then they would know
how much we have.

1722
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,850
They brought nothing
but their mouths.

1723
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:34,910
Why did you give them the total?

1724
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,410
How much does our team have?

1725
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,050
- Our team has 36 percent.
- It dropped so much.

1726
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,950
- The shares are similar now.
- How did it drop so much?

1727
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,760
- My goodness.
- Haha has a lot of shares.

1728
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,620
- There is a balance now.
- Haha does.

1729
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,990
- Shin Rok contributed too.
- My situation isn't half bad.

1730
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:47,120
- My goodness.
- I see.

1731
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:00,670
And you... I am sorry, but...

1732
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,840
- What?
- I will tell you later.

1733
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,840
- What?
- Tell him now.

1734
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,840
Shin Rok and Haha.

1735
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,170
What about them?

1736
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,210
- A hot pack is in the pocket.
- Yes.

1737
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:08,320
Would you give it to me?

1738
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,920
Would you give it to me?

1739
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,320
(He asked Haha to return
the hot pack.)

1740
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,610
It's cold.

1741
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,320
- Was that what you wanted to say?
- That was unbelievable.

1742
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,150
- Seriously.
- I mean...

1743
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,820
Would you give me my hot pack?

1744
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,820
- All right.
- It's here.

1745
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,170
Since our jackets were changed...

1746
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,900
All right. Return the hot pack.

1747
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,400
- Okay.
- All right.

1748
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,400
- Okay. I didn't mind.
- Okay.

1749
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,670
I was going to ask later,
but it entered my mind.

1750
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,900
The next mission is...

1751
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,800
the Deflated Heir.

1752
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,610
The swan is the number one treasure
of Soonbak Group's chairman.

1753
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:42,320
Deflate it and put it
in a plastic container.

1754
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,010
- You must close the lid completely.
- Okay.

1755
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,380
- Let's do this.
- Those are inflatable swans.

1756
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,110
- You use them at a pool.
- Let's win.

1757
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,260
- Here it is. There are two valves.
- One is on the neck.

1758
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,260
No, there are three valves.

1759
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,030
Two on the wings
and one on the neck.

1760
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,550
You use them at a pool.

1761
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:57,800
- Where will you go?
- It's fun.

1762
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,900
- I want to go sledding.
- Go ahead.

1763
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,340
It would be hard
to use it as a sled.

1764
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,070
(They begin to race on the snow.)

1765
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:05,710
He must play with Na Eun like that.

1766
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,780
- Jae Suk, it's so much fun.
- My goodness.

1767
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,510
(He plays with Ji Hyo
as if he is playing with Na Eun.)

1768
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,210
- He sure is a dad with a daughter.
- It's so much fun.

1769
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,320
- Hold on. We...
- Hey.

1770
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,480
What are you doing? Look at them.

1771
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,880
(Hitting)

1772
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,320
They are different.

1773
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,380
It's because he is single.

1774
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,780
- A single man is different.
- Most dads are like that.

1775
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,820
He is different.

1776
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,150
- When dads are energetic...
- He is so different from Jae Suk.

1777
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,190
(Shin Rok rides the tube too.)

1778
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,190
- Do that for me.
- My goodness.

1779
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:33,320
Se Chan.

1780
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,900
- Se Chan, do that for me.
- It's nice.

1781
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,510
- Do that for me.
- You need strength.

1782
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,340
- It's nice.
- We put it in this box, right?

1783
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,530
- Make sure you close the lid.
- This is fun.

1784
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,070
- Please listen to me.
- Where are the valves.

1785
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:47,510
Let's focus.

1786
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:48,880
Please focus.

1787
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,380
- Okay.
- Focus.

1788
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,820
- Okay.
- Okay.

1789
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,320
It would be fun
to ride it down the hill.

1790
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,320
I know. It sounds fun.

1791
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,820
- I want to do it.
- Go ahead and do it.

1792
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,880
- Really?
- Is there a hill?

1793
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,280
Hyung In told us
to go ahead and do it.

1794
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,550
- On top of the hill?
- Yes.

1795
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:03,990
It's fun to ride a tube like this.

1796
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,170
- It does sound fun.
- It's so much fun.

1797
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,590
I can ride it by myself.

1798
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:08,360
- Is there a hill?
- Yes. You just need to push it.

1799
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,800
- There he goes again.
- Do it.

1800
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,110
He will get hurt.

1801
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:13,240
- Don't get hurt. Be careful.
- Why...

1802
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,510
(His mischievous side comes out
when he sees the snow.)

1803
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,630
There you go.

1804
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,780
- Yes. That's how you do it.
- It hurts.

1805
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,610
Let's please play the game.

1806
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:27,710
Why can't you focus?

1807
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,190
- Go ahead.
- Please focus!

1808
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:31,780
Let's play the game.

1809
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:35,090
I am sorry.
All of us were born mischievous.

1810
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,820
- Do we deflate it now?
- Are you ready?

1811
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:38,690
- Let's go.
- Do we begin now?

1812
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,670
Let's divide up the sections.

1813
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,900
- Take the biggest section.
- Okay.

1814
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,340
- I will take the head.
- Okay.

1815
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,960
- Get ready.
- How many valves are there?

1816
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,630
- Are there four?
- Get that one out first.

1817
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,780
- Take it out.
- Take it out first.

1818
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,800
Take it out. There you go.

1819
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,800
This one too.

1820
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,480
My goodness.

1821
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,780
- Deflate this part.
- I can't get the valve out.

1822
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,650
- Can't you get it out?
- There is one here too.

1823
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,420
- I can't get it out.
- There is one on the head.

1824
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,010
There is one here too.

1825
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:03,320
My goodness.

1826
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,280
- I didn't get it out.
- Did you get it out?

1827
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,820
The valve needs to come out.

1828
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,420
For goodness' sake.

1829
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,630
(At that moment,
Se Chan gets the valve out!)

1830
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:12,530
- Se Chan, I got it out.
- Did you get it out?

1831
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,440
- Press down on the head.
- It needs to come out.

1832
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,030
- Use your teeth.
- My teeth?

1833
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:19,210
- Use your teeth.
- I got this valve out. Deflate it.

1834
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,440
Is it out?

1835
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:24,170
(Thanks to Suk Jin's teeth,
air begins to come out.)

1836
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,400
Hey, get the valve out first.

1837
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,550
There we go.

1838
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:30,940
- Ouch.
- Move out of the way.

1839
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,210
- So Min.
- So Min.

1840
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,550
Move out of the way.

1841
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,190
- So Min, get the valve out.
- There is a valve on the head.

1842
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,230
- So Min, get the valve out.
- We are going fast.

1843
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,050
- Air is coming out.
- Good.

1844
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,150
It will come out soon.

1845
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,490
- It's in so deep. There we go.
- There we go.

1846
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,090
This is hard.

1847
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,070
We need to press the area around it.

1848
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,010
For goodness' sake.

1849
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:53,240
Is it coming out, So Min?

1850
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,530
I will deflate the wing first.

1851
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,010
- Is this wing separate?
- Okay.

1852
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,130
Look at them.

1853
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,900
The air is coming out fast
since I gained weight.

1854
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,820
- Jong Kook, look at them.
- They are almost done.

1855
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,610
What should we do about them?

1856
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,880
- I will fold this part.
- Here.

1857
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,210
- We need to fold it.
- Here.

1858
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,280
- Get up.
- Se Chan.

1859
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,780
- Fold it.
- We need to fold it.

1860
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,280
- Wait a second.
- Hey.

1861
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:13,190
- Fold it. Wait a second.
- Hey.

1862
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,130
What are you doing?

1863
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,530
- Wait a second.
- Good job.

1864
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:18,900
- Good job.
- What's wrong with her?

1865
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,590
- Shin Rok.
- Hey.

1866
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:22,670
What are you doing?

1867
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,300
(She returns
after throwing the container away.)

1868
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,530
- We need to deflate it more.
- I mean...

1869
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,570
- For goodness' sake.
- They aren't done yet.

1870
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,840
Hey, put it in here.

1871
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,340
It isn't completely deflated.

1872
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,340
- Put it in the container first.
- Let's deflate it further.

1873
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,840
- The tail part.
- Where is it?

1874
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,840
Hey.

1875
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,840
- The tail part.
- Where is it?

1876
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,990
Hey.

1877
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,440
- Come on.
- Hey.

1878
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,610
Good job.

1879
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:42,820
(Running away)

1880
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:43,960
Hey.

1881
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,590
For goodness' sake.

1882
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,050
You are so mischievous.

1883
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,360
(Shin Rok perfectly adjusted
to Running Man.)

1884
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,530
For goodness' sake.

1885
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:51,400
I can't believe her.

1886
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,530
(A real smile
people couldn't see in the drama)

1887
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,360
How am I supposed to bring it?

1888
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,240
(Ouch)

1889
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,960
There are thorns.

1890
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,130
- Bring it here. Open it.
- Open it.

1891
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,010
Let's put it in the container first.

1892
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,710
- Put it in.
- If we put it in, the valves...

1893
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:06,840
Deflate it.

1894
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,110
(They plan to deflate the swan
as they put it in the container.)

1895
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,420
- One, two, three.
- Most of the air is out.

1896
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:11,550
Most of the air is out.

1897
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:12,780
- Okay. Suk Jin, bring it here.
- Again.

1898
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,050
I think it will go in.

1899
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,650
I think it will go in.

1900
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,260
Hurry up and bring it.

1901
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,780
Step on it.

1902
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,900
Suk Jin, put it inside.

1903
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,590
Suk Jin, put it inside.

1904
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,400
Come on.

1905
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,590
Hurry up and put it inside.

1906
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,170
(Haha stole the lid
right before they put it in!)

1907
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,940
- It won't go in.
- We need the lid.

1908
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,210
- Where is the lid?
- Here.

1909
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,480
It's ours. Oh, you are my teammate.

1910
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,070
The lid.

1911
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,940
- Run.
- Shin Rok.

1912
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,710
The lid.

1913
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:45,090
(Haha passed the lid to Shin Rok.)

1914
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,440
- Hey.
- The lid.

1915
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,320
We just need the lid.

1916
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,590
- We just need the lid.
- Suk Jin.

1917
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,860
We need to put it in.

1918
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,760
(Suk Jin tries to stop them.)

1919
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,230
- My goodness.
- How is she so strong?

1920
01:03:58,590 --> 01:03:59,730
Hey.

1921
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:01,940
(It doesn't occur to him
that he is weak.)

1922
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,740
- Hey.
- My goodness.

1923
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,940
- It broke.
- He broke it.

1924
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,610
- He broke it.
- He broke it.

1925
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,380
Why am I putting it in? Hold on.

1926
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,800
He is putting it in.

1927
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,420
What am I doing?

1928
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,820
- Jae Suk, there is the lid.
- Jae Suk.

1929
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,840
- What?
- Where?

1930
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,510
- Hold on.
- What happened?

1931
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:22,510
She is so mischievous.

1932
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,920
- Hey.
- Jae Suk, close the lid.

1933
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,990
- Hey.
- Here.

1934
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:26,490
- Is it in?
- No.

1935
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:27,960
It needs to be brought to the front.

1936
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,050
No!

1937
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,050
- He did it.
- It's done.

1938
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:31,260
- We closed the lid.
- We closed the lid.

1939
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,490
- Success.
- We closed the lid.

1940
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,230
- It's done.
- We closed the lid.

1941
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,900
- We closed the lid.
- Success.

1942
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,510
- We did it too.
- We brought it to the front.

1943
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,110
- We did it perfectly.
- Let's see it.

1944
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:42,130
- Good job.
- We almost lost.

1945
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:44,340
The team that put away
the tube perfectly,

1946
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,110
- Suk Jin's team won.
- I finally won.

1947
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:49,050
Do you know what startled me?

1948
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,740
I went over there to stop them
and began to put the tube in.

1949
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,590
I became flustered.

1950
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,010
- "Why am I putting it in?"
- He was helping us.

1951
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:56,880
- He was a helper.
- Good.

1952
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,960
The major shareholder,
Jae Suk, can take...

1953
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,460
- four percent.
- Four percent?

1954
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:03,690
- Take Haha's coins.
- Haha.

1955
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:04,820
I will take Haha's coins.

1956
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,920
- Is Haha the richest?
- Give him four coins.

1957
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:08,570
- Come on.
- Give him four coins.

1958
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,670
- Okay.
- Shin Rok has a lot too.

1959
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:12,440
- Now,
- Shin Rok has a lot too.

1960
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:14,170
why don't you give us
two coins each?

1961
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:15,240
- What?
- Come on.

1962
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,630
Two coins each? That's nonsense.

1963
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,440
- Two coins each.
- Even if he does that...

1964
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,150
- Get lost.
- You won't even have six coins.

1965
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,820
What did you say?

1966
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,820
- You wanted two coins.
- "Get lost?"

1967
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,490
- There are 4 members.
- There are 4 members.

1968
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,610
They have a lot of shares.

1969
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,280
- Where are my coins?
- They must be in there.

1970
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,860
- Right?
- There is no way you lost them.

1971
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:33,880
(Shin Rok lost her money pouch.)

1972
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,260
This is my scarf.

1973
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,400
Come on.

1974
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:40,320
Look for it.
You rolled around on the snow earlier.

1975
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,260
- It must be there somewhere.
- Go over there and look.

1976
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,440
- Go.
- I will be back.

1977
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:46,440
(Shin Rok goes to find her pouch.)

1978
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,340
(Why is Se Chan grinning?)

1979
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,240
- I have Shin Rok's pouch.
- Really?

1980
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,340
She needs to find it.

1981
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,240
(They exchanged their jackets
before the mission.)

1982
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,650
(Thus, Se Chan obtained
Shin Rok's money pouch.)

1983
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,920
Shin Rok.

1984
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:00,550
- It's missing.
- Shin Rok,

1985
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:02,420
give me two coins if you find it.

1986
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,320
- He must have it.
- No.

1987
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,530
It isn't me.

1988
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:07,530
I can't give it to you otherwise.

1989
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:09,320
- You must have it.
- No.

1990
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,490
Will you give me a coin?

1991
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:11,760
- This is mine.
- Really?

1992
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,670
- I will give you a coin.
- Give me a coin.

1993
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,800
He is good.

1994
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,800
- It was in the pocket.
- He has good business skills.

1995
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,460
It's not over until it's over.

1996
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,570
It's not over until it's over.

1997
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,050
My goodness.

1998
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:27,570
- What was that?
- You got fooled!

1999
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,320
What was that?

2000
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,070
- You should have taken one out.
- You should have done that first.

2001
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,610
You got fooled!

2002
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:34,490
It's not over until it's over.

2003
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,010
You got fooled!

2004
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,420
- Take that!
- This is ridiculous.

2005
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,690
Do Jun, you punk.

2006
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:41,230
(Do Jun tricked her in the drama,
so she took it out on Se Chan.)

2007
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,860
Okay. I got it.

2008
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,150
- Thank goodness.
- How annoying.

2009
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,190
- That was refreshing.
- Good job.

2010
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,860
- Okay.
- Now, Team B's major shareholder...

2011
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,170
became Shin Rok.

2012
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,690
Is it Shin Rok now?

2013
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:52,800
Let's go and have the last
general shareholders' meeting.

2014
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,300
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

2015
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,710
(They set off for the last
general shareholders' meeting!)

2016
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,210
It's finally the last one.

2017
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,980
I have a benefit.

2018
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:01,110
Let's do this.

2019
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,510
Let me join you guys.

2020
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,990
You poor thing.

2021
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:06,050
Shall we let him join us?
He is pitiful.

2022
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:07,340
- Okay. You can join us.
- You can join us.

2023
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,710
- All right.
- Just like the last time,

2024
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:12,280
you need 15 percent or more
to attend the meeting.

2025
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,260
- Fifteen percent or more.
- The eldest son's advantage.

2026
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,650
The eldest son's advantage remains.

2027
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:19,730
Those who want can participate.

2028
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:22,260
- Who wants to go first?
- We need three members, right?

2029
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,990
We should go
after people get a flour bomb.

2030
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,740
- That's right.
- We should go...

2031
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:29,130
- after the shares add up.
- Going first has pros and cons.

2032
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,780
- I need a big break.
- Will you get a big break...

2033
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,210
or a flour bomb?

2034
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:34,780
- The 3 of us will go.
- The 3 of us will go.

2035
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,320
We let Se Chan join
since he looked so pitiful.

2036
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,650
- He looked so pitiful.
- Do you want to go first?

2037
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:38,880
- Yes.
- Go first.

2038
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,420
- I will go next.
- No, don't go first.

2039
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,110
- It's more advantageous.
- It's more advantageous.

2040
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:44,050
- We need to lose some flour bombs.
- No. It's more advantageous.

2041
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:45,260
There are pinatas with a big prize.

2042
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,550
That's right.
It's more advantageous.

2043
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:47,860
- Seriously.
- A pinata with a big prize.

2044
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,990
The two of you should go then.

2045
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:50,960
- We can't.
- We can't. We need one more person.

2046
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:54,360
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

2047
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,490
- Haha.
- Let's not go right now.

2048
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,360
- I can't get 3 flour bombs.
- Let's pick number 35.

2049
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:00,940
- Give me a chance.
- Number 35.

2050
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,070
- Let's go with number ten.
- Haha.

2051
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:03,740
- I like number 8.
- Let's go with number 8.

2052
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,780
- I like number 8.
- Number 8? Se Chan is unlucky.

2053
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,380
Let's go with number 8.
It's number 8.

2054
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,420
I hope they get a flour bomb
right away.

2055
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,740
- I know.
- Three flour bombs.

2056
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,550
- Three flour bombs.
- Three flour bombs.

2057
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,150
It will be so funny.

2058
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:16,320
- One, two, three.
- Flour.

2059
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,380
- What?
- There is something inside.

2060
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,960
- Something came out.
- Zero percent.

2061
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,190
- One percent.
- Okay.

2062
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:21,730
- They got one percent.
- Go.

2063
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,050
- They should keep going.
- Let's go with number ten.

2064
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:25,230
- Let me pick it just once.
- Number 35.

2065
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:27,420
- Let's have Se Chan pick it.
- Sure.

2066
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,630
- Number 3.
- Number 3?

2067
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,440
- How about number 4?
- Number 4?

2068
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,630
Okay. We will live if we try to die.

2069
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:33,960
- Let's go with number 3.
- Number 3?

2070
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:34,980
Number 4 and number 3.

2071
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,240
Can we open them at the same time?

2072
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,240
- No.
- No?

2073
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,410
Open one at a time.

2074
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:40,150
What kind of nonsense is that?

2075
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,410
For goodness' sake.

2076
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:43,080
Had that been allowed,
we would have gone together.

2077
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,480
- We would have gone together.
- This one?

2078
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,910
- Can I open them with both hands?
- This one?

2079
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:47,880
- This one?
- That was nonsense.

2080
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,050
- Not number four?
- Let's go with this one.

2081
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,550
- Let's go with number four.
- All right then.

2082
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:51,990
- Number four.
- Go.

2083
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:53,750
- I don't think it's number 4.
- Go with number 3.

2084
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,290
- Number three.
- For goodness' sake.

2085
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:56,590
One, two, three.

2086
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,700
Flour.

2087
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:58,900
- One percent.
- One percent.

2088
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,330
- One percent. Go.
- We now have two percent.

2089
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:01,500
- Go.
- One percent per person.

2090
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,700
Let's open number four.

2091
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,260
Number four? Okay.

2092
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,570
We will live if we try to die.

2093
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,940
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2094
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,980
Two percent.

2095
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,110
- Two percent.
- Two percent.

2096
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:12,170
- Go or stop?
- We now have four percent.

2097
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:13,780
- Go.
- Go.

2098
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:16,210
- This had better be a bomb.
- I hope they lose it all.

2099
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:17,620
- I hope they lose it all.
- Then it will be redistributed.

2100
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,080
- Seriously.
- Lose it all.

2101
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,690
- Lose it all.
- Please.

2102
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,490
- A flour bomb.
- Shall we go with number ten?

2103
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,250
- Let's go with number 10.
- Let's go with number 10.

2104
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:25,580
- All right. Gather around.
- Number ten.

2105
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:26,880
All right.

2106
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,200
One, two, three.

2107
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,030
No way.

2108
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:32,230
- Two percent.
- Two percent. We have six percent.

2109
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:33,660
- Go.
- Go.

2110
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:35,460
- Two percent.
- How did it happen?

2111
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,570
- Go.
- Go.

2112
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:39,630
Will you keep going?
They are unbelievable.

2113
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:41,830
- They are getting lucky.
- I am impressed with their guts.

2114
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,280
I would have stopped no matter what.

2115
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,910
If they gather the shares
and get a flour bomb in the end...

2116
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:48,510
- Haha, how about number 22?
- Okay.

2117
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,480
- Number 22. It's a good number.
- I am a bit nervous.

2118
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,790
- Come. Number 22.
- Number 22.

2119
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:53,040
- Let's go.
- So far, the odds are good.

2120
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,340
A flour bomb.

2121
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,990
Number 22, let's go.

2122
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:57,620
- One, two, three.
- Flour.

2123
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,660
I shouldn't have teamed up
with an unlucky punk.

2124
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:02,750
- One, two, three.
- Flour.

2125
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,530
(They got a flour bomb.)

2126
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,590
- I got unlucky.
- That's it.

2127
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,440
That's it.

2128
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:12,910
That's it.

2129
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:14,980
(Laughing)

2130
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,300
Why did you pick number 22?

2131
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,340
Redistribute the six percent.

2132
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,540
- Why did you pick number 22?
- You had gathered 6 percent.

2133
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:22,540
Since a flour bomb went off,

2134
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,210
we will put the shares
in other pinatas.

2135
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,690
- Turn in 2 percent each.
- Turn in 2 percent each.

2136
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:27,150
- Okay.
- A flour bomb went off.

2137
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:28,910
- Okay.
- Here goes the eldest son.

2138
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:30,860
- Will you go in there?
- I will go in there.

2139
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,190
- Let's go.
- Here goes the eldest son.

2140
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:35,120
- I...
- I am bankrupt.

2141
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,120
So Min and I will go again.

2142
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,260
- We will go again.
- We will go again.

2143
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,260
It's meaningless
unless I place first.

2144
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:42,000
- It's over.
- Soonbak Investment is over.

2145
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,570
- Finally...
- Soonbak Investment...

2146
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:44,960
- is out of business.
- Se Chan is done.

2147
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,300
The youngest one...

2148
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,300
- is done.
- I am done.

2149
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:51,700
(Se Chan went bankrupt.)

2150
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,170
I was nearly there.

2151
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:54,670
Will the eldest son go in?

2152
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,450
Is it better to go now
or after another round?

2153
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,450
- He would stop after a big prize.
- A big prize.

2154
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:01,010
- I am not the type to take risks.
- I would stop after a big prize.

2155
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:03,010
- Do you want to go?
- Then I will go first.

2156
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,360
- My goodness.
- Will you go first?

2157
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,030
- He is showing his ambition.
- The eldest son.

2158
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:09,230
Unless I place first,
it's meaningless.

2159
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:12,290
I will stop after opening
15 pinatas.

2160
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:13,960
Fifteen pinatas?

2161
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,330
The odds would be crazy.

2162
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:16,900
The eldest's hope.

2163
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,160
(He's been keeping his position
without any performance.)

2164
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,160
The eldest.

2165
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,330
(He's been keeping his position
without any performance.)

2166
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:21,500
Because he's the eldest?

2167
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,540
Suk Jin is gambling big time.

2168
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,300
The eldest son chose number 14.

2169
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,250
The eldest.

2170
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,170
The eldest's privilege.

2171
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,210
- Yes. It's two percent.
- Okay.

2172
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,340
- Awesome.
- Five percent.

2173
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,160
- It's two.
- It's the other way around.

2174
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,230
- What are you doing?
- Two percent.

2175
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:40,660
- It was upside down.
- Suk Jin.

2176
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,360
(He begins
with dim sight and 2 percent.)

2177
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,500
- Number 11.
- Next to the bomb...

2178
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:48,160
You don't know how the show works.

2179
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,090
They never leave a bomb
next to a bomb.

2180
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:52,240
We didn't know.

2181
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,870
- Get ready.
- You need to step forward.

2182
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,580
- You were right. It's five percent.
- Five percent.

2183
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,800
- Awesome.
- Okay!

2184
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,750
(Suk Jin is getting closer
to his big picture.)

2185
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,480
This is bad.

2186
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,510
Seven. I'm still hungry.

2187
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:08,510
- Please let it be a bomb.
- Seven percent.

2188
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:09,990
There's still a big shot left.

2189
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,080
- It's getting nervous.
- The big one still remains.

2190
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,380
If I hit the jackpot, I'll stop.

2191
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:15,030
- It's the flour.
- What are you doing?

2192
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:18,000
- He's amazing.
- I don't think...

2193
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,660
- Have you decided it?
- there's flour here.

2194
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:21,570
- What's the number?
- It's 17.

2195
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,400
Okay. It's the lucky number.

2196
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,760
- Flour.
- Flour.

2197
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:25,830
(What about this time?)

2198
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,040
He failed.

2199
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:34,000
(It's flour.)

2200
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,320
- Why didn't he stop?
- He failed.

2201
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,380
You should've stopped.
Didn't you get seven?

2202
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,510
You should've stopped
after getting seven percent.

2203
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:44,710
(Suk Jin got 7 percent, but he lost
everything for being greedy.)

2204
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,790
- Is he left with nothing now?
- That was amazing.

2205
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:49,030
- Suk Jin has nothing now.
- His car rental...

2206
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:50,620
- is closed as of today.
- Seven percent.

2207
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,260
- That was a bummer.
- You should've stopped...

2208
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,730
- after seven percent.
- He's got nothing.

2209
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:55,330
It's my turn now.

2210
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:59,800
It's about time to get covered with flour,
Mr. Major Shareholder.

2211
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,280
I can't believe he's shopping alone.

2212
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,540
- That's cool.
- He must have so much.

2213
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,610
Once you grab it, it's over.

2214
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:08,650
Okay. Here.

2215
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,040
- Number 28.
- Number 28.

2216
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:14,340
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2217
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,550
- It's 14.
- How did he find it?

2218
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:17,880
- It's 14 percent.
- Is it 14?

2219
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:21,380
(Jae Suk found 14 percent at once.)

2220
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:22,530
- It's 14 percent.
- How is that possible?

2221
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:23,900
Is it 14?

2222
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,260
It's 14.

2223
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:26,570
- It's 14.
- It's 14 percent.

2224
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:27,620
That upsets me.

2225
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,900
- Are you stopping?
- It's noblesse oblige.

2226
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,000
- I'd stop if I were you.
- What happened?

2227
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,200
Do it again.

2228
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,440
- Do it again.
- Do it again.

2229
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,480
- Stop.
- No.

2230
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,280
- Keep going.
- Stop.

2231
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,010
- Stop.
- Stop.

2232
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:43,840
- Stop. There are still more.
- Seriously.

2233
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,010
So Min and me.

2234
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:47,490
That's awesome. 14 percent.

2235
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:49,880
That's awesome.

2236
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:53,160
If you lend us three,
we'll go hit the jackpot.

2237
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,330
We'll go together.

2238
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,590
If you lend us, I'll take him too.

2239
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:58,460
No, that's not right.

2240
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:01,090
- Haha.
- Stay quiet, you unfortunate boy.

2241
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:03,290
My brother will kill you.

2242
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,940
- Fight for real.
- Yes.

2243
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:07,910
If you give me three,
I'll take them with me.

2244
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,370
- I'll go with him.
- If you take me...

2245
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,130
- Give us three.
- You should go together.

2246
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:12,870
- Okay.
- We'll pay you back.

2247
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,500
- Here are three.
- Got it.

2248
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,170
- Thank you.
- I got it.

2249
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,710
- We have 15.
- Let's go there after this.

2250
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,490
- It's 39.
- Just trust me.

2251
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:22,910
All right. 1, 2, 3.

2252
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,490
Seriously. It's so annoying.

2253
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:26,530
Jae Suk.

2254
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,160
(It's flour again.)

2255
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,360
What is this?

2256
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,900
Lend me five.

2257
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:34,420
So Min. Let's go for number 24.

2258
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,160
- One, two, three.
- Flour.

2259
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:38,160
- It's 11 percent.
- It's 11 percent.

2260
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,830
- Let's open one more.
- One more?

2261
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,440
- I'm going to be rich.
- Let's take it to the end.

2262
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:43,780
- Let's go!
- Please.

2263
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:44,870
One, two, three.

2264
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,870
(It's flour again.)

2265
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:49,320
Let's shout "rich."

2266
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,870
- Rich.
- Rich.

2267
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:52,580
One, two, three.

2268
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:55,010
(They face ruin in the end.)

2269
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,550
(Jumping)

2270
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:59,080
It's a festival.

2271
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:01,730
It's a festival.

2272
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,500
- We should do it now.
- About five...

2273
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,700
It upsets me so much.

2274
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,620
- Jae Suk. I'll join them.
- I'll give it to you.

2275
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:09,090
Go away.

2276
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:12,040
Let me play for the last time.

2277
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:14,660
Those beggars.

2278
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,540
Those beggars.

2279
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:19,000
- Hey...
- I was the major shareholder.

2280
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:23,340
I was the major shareholder,
but I hung out with beggars.

2281
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,380
That So Min beggar and I...

2282
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:29,510
Hey. So Min.

2283
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:30,860
(Looking pitiful)

2284
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,530
You...

2285
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,230
(Blaming)

2286
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,290
How many are there left?

2287
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,830
Two jackpots and two flour.

2288
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,330
- Two jackpots and two flour.
- See?

2289
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:41,570
We just need to hit the jackpot.

2290
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:44,460
(There are 4 pinatas left.)

2291
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,800
(Among them, only 2 are jackpots.)

2292
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,200
- Two jackpots?
- Yes.

2293
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,440
Two flour?

2294
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:51,330
Among the four?

2295
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:52,780
It's a 50-50 chance.

2296
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,610
- I can't do it.
- We have to do it.

2297
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,580
- We have to do it.
- Give us a chance.

2298
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:58,280
- Because I hung out with beggars...
- We have to do it.

2299
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,510
Jae Suk.

2300
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:01,950
- We're family.
- Hey.

2301
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,990
- Give me one last chance.
- Go away.

2302
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:06,030
Oh, Jae Suk.

2303
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:07,880
Hey. Shall petty shareholders
gather together?

2304
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:10,330
We just need to make 15.

2305
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,120
- How many do you have?
- Three.

2306
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:14,370
- I have two.
- I have four.

2307
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,290
- Four? If we're going to play...
- You should work together.

2308
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:17,500
Jae Suk.

2309
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:20,410
Just one more round.

2310
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:23,200
- It's heavy.
- It looks heavy.

2311
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,540
Right?

2312
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,370
Do you think this is light?

2313
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,820
This is ambiguous.

2314
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,170
The two feel different.

2315
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,320
Yes. Hang on.

2316
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,190
- The way they shake...
- They shake.

2317
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,380
It looks about right.

2318
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:42,230
You can't shake them.

2319
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,160
- Okay.
- They're heavier.

2320
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:46,570
- Why are you shaking them?
- I want to leave.

2321
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:47,870
- No way.
- You should leave.

2322
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:48,940
- You should leave.
- It's a 50-50 chance.

2323
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,700
Two flour and two jackpots.

2324
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:52,540
Twelve? 35?

2325
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:54,000
- Yes.
- Let's go for it.

2326
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,240
Whatever.

2327
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,630
You touched it already.

2328
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:57,780
One, two, three.

2329
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,170
(Number 35 was a dud.)

2330
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:07,820
- Jae Suk. Give me one last chance.
- Jae Suk. Just this once.

2331
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,750
- I'll do anything you say.
- It's your era.

2332
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,210
Please.

2333
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,990
The jackpot is guaranteed.

2334
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:15,360
You're the energy of Soonbak.

2335
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,660
It hit me right in the face.

2336
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,500
I can't believe it ends here.

2337
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,090
It hit me right in the face.

2338
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:23,160
You look like a white tiger.

2339
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:24,400
Thank you.

2340
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,000
- I'm going in again.
- How many do you have?

2341
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:27,630
- After this, I have 17.
- Let me go play.

2342
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:28,700
Seven.

2343
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,480
- How many do you have?
- I have three.

2344
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,800
If anyone with two joins us,
we can go in.

2345
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,780
- I have two.
- Come join us.

2346
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:36,010
- The four of us should go.
- What?

2347
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:37,750
We're going in.

2348
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:40,120
- There's only one bomb.
- Suk Jin.

2349
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,990
- Can you let me in for once?
- Let's remove two.

2350
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,490
Suk Jin.

2351
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:44,820
- Suk Jin. Please let me play.
- Let me join you.

2352
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,290
No. We collected everything we got.

2353
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:47,620
- We have four people already.
- We have four people already.

2354
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,360
- The major beggars must leave.
- Thank you, Suk Jin.

2355
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,530
Go away, you beggars.

2356
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:52,620
- Go away.
- Let us join you just this once.

2357
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:53,760
Let's just do it.

2358
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,540
- Six people.
- Let's go for 6 and 7.

2359
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:56,960
- How about 6 and 7?
- Hey.

2360
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,290
Here we go.

2361
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,830
Haha. Come here.

2362
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:02,480
One, two, three.

2363
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,200
(Will the petty shareholders
turn the tables?)

2364
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,000
Two, three.

2365
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,170
- Okay.
- What is it?

2366
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:10,820
It's 22.

2367
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:12,010
- Okay.
- What is it?

2368
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,540
(They hit the jackpot.)

2369
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:15,690
It's a jackpot.

2370
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:18,580
(Jealous)

2371
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:20,620
- Let's do one more.
- How many are there left?

2372
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:22,660
One 16 percent.

2373
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:25,420
- It's one of the two, right?
- Yes.

2374
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,370
- One is flour and that's the other?
- Let's come back.

2375
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:28,700
- Let's come back.
- Let's go for it.

2376
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:29,740
- No.
- We have to go for it.

2377
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:30,760
They should go for it.

2378
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,410
You need to go for it right away.

2379
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:34,610
Suk Jin. Let's stick to 22 percent.

2380
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:36,170
- Stick to it?
- Yes.

2381
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:37,580
- Let's come back.
- Okay.

2382
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,110
- You weak cowards.
- Stop.

2383
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:41,450
How many do I get?

2384
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,670
- What?
- Right. You should stop.

2385
01:18:42,670 --> 01:18:44,670
Honestly, you should take less.

2386
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:46,120
Let's split them.

2387
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,290
I don't mind taking less.

2388
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,450
- We'll split them.
- You may split them.

2389
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:50,320
The major shareholder
should distribute them.

2390
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,380
- Wait.
- Let me do it.

2391
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:52,620
- I'm the major shareholder.
- She should take them.

2392
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,330
The major shareholder
should distribute them.

2393
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,660
- You should distribute them.
- Okay.

2394
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,050
- How many do we get?
- We got 22.

2395
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:00,160
Take four first.

2396
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,620
Thank you.

2397
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,290
- Thank you.
- That's fair.

2398
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:05,960
- This is enough for me.
- Four times five.

2399
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,260
I'm good.

2400
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,200
Here's one more
for the one you lost earlier.

2401
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,980
- Thank you.
- Okay.

2402
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,580
- Done.
- It was 22. Okay.

2403
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:15,780
(Happy ending)

2404
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,780
- It's the last chance.
- It's really the last chance.

2405
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,210
- I feel confident.
- I feel confident.

2406
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,790
- There's a number I have in mind.
- We'll only succeed.

2407
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,010
- Jae Suk. Help us.
- We won't fail.

2408
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:25,380
Give us one more chance.

2409
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,950
- Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk.

2410
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:29,830
- They...
- It's the last round.

2411
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:32,070
keep telling me to play.

2412
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:33,760
- Jae Suk.
- I said no.

2413
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,400
- Just this once.
- You're the energy of Soonbak.

2414
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,290
- They've gone crazy.
- Okay.

2415
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,760
- Hurry up.
- Good. Haha, come here.

2416
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:42,800
- Seriously.
- Okay.

2417
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,940
- Let's hit the jackpot.
- Haha.

2418
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,000
- Which one is it?
- I'll hit the jackpot tonight.

2419
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:50,480
- Seriously, these kids.
- It's all about one shot.

2420
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,080
How can you manage the company
like that?

2421
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,340
We'll turn the tables.

2422
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:56,490
Haha. Do you think it's number six?

2423
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:58,660
- It's not number six.
- No?

2424
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,990
- Number 36.
- Stay still.

2425
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:03,530
We were going to choose
number six next.

2426
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:05,030
- What if we went for it?
- Go for number six.

2427
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:06,570
- I'll give you the chance.
- Me?

2428
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:08,420
- Yes.
- Not her.

2429
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:09,830
She's possessed.

2430
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:13,200
She needs an exorcism.

2431
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,610
She's darn unfortunate. It's crazy.

2432
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:17,130
Go away!

2433
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:18,700
Go away, you prick.

2434
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:21,650
She looks like a ghost right now.

2435
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,210
They've lost their minds.

2436
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:26,820
- This is why...
- One last chance.

2437
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,010
- This is why gambling is scary.
- Right.

2438
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:30,410
- It's really scary.
- Yes.

2439
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,690
You should've gone for it.

2440
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:33,190
Number 36 won't move.

2441
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:34,530
- Look.
- Number six.

2442
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,700
- The line is long.
- We'll go for number six.

2443
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:39,160
Okay. They'll go for number six.

2444
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,200
Number six.

2445
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:44,900
One, two, three.

2446
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:48,440
- It's 16.
- It's 16. Good.

2447
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,110
(They succeed
in drawing 16 percent.)

2448
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:54,580
- I'm lucky.
- Number six.

2449
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:56,010
We should've gone for number six.

2450
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:57,250
- It was a jackpot.
- It was a jackpot.

2451
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:59,490
Let's bring in the heir board.

2452
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:00,750
This is so much fun.

2453
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,660
I shouldn't team up with So Min.

2454
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,790
Do you all remember Soonbak's motto?

2455
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:06,790
- Yes.
- Yes.

2456
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:07,790
What is it?

2457
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:10,360
Everything depends on luck,
not effort.

2458
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,620
It's
"Everything depends on luck, not effort."

2459
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,260
I got it. Give me one.

2460
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,730
I still got it.

2461
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:17,070
I was the first one to say it.

2462
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:19,410
Why do I want it so badly?

2463
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:21,440
I can pull it all day. I love it.

2464
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,910
- Me too.
- Why is it so fun?

2465
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:24,940
It was
"Everything depends on luck, not effort."

2466
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:27,910
We'll decide the heir
by following the motto.

2467
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:29,980
Numbers 1 to 100 are written
on the heir board.

2468
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:33,410
You'll put as many stickers
as your share.

2469
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:36,880
We'll draw a number,
and the person's name on the number...

2470
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:38,990
will become Soonbak's chairman
and vice chairman.

2471
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:40,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

2472
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,250
Your chances are so high.

2473
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:45,620
The person with the most shares
will put his name first.

2474
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,700
I'll reveal the share ratio.

2475
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,830
- Why would you?
- It's Jae Suk.

2476
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:50,240
The person with
the most shares is...

2477
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:52,240
Jae Suk with 45 percent.

2478
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,040
- He has nearly half.
- He took most of them.

2479
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,440
- That's amazing.
- Next is Shin Rok.

2480
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,330
Second place goes to Kim Shin Rok
with 16 percent.

2481
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,870
She has 16 percent.

2482
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:02,650
There are more than one third place.

2483
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:04,040
- With eight percent...
- Did I place third?

2484
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,510
He placed third.

2485
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:08,340
Song Ji Hyo, Yang Se Chan,
and Ji Suk Jin.

2486
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,160
We borrowed so many.

2487
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,690
- Well done.
- I placed last.

2488
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:14,080
Next is So Min with six percent.

2489
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,590
Next is Jong Kook with five percent.

2490
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,370
Last place goes to Haha
with four percent.

2491
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:21,590
- Darn it.
- Go away.

2492
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:23,040
I was once a major shareholder.

2493
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,540
Wasn't he a major shareholder?

2494
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,240
I was a major shareholder,
but after I met these devils...

2495
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,170
He kept paying the penalty.

2496
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:32,540
- It's upsetting.
- That was hilarious.

2497
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,700
- That was funny.
- That's life.

2498
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,250
- You never know.
- You never know.

2499
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:38,340
- You never know.
- My goodness.

2500
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:39,620
(Laughing)

2501
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:40,690
It's annoying.

2502
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:44,290
- Right. Draw a line.
- Really?

2503
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,830
Are you going diagonal?

2504
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:46,830
- That's a good idea.
- Yes.

2505
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:48,620
- X? That's cool.
- Draw an X like a bingo.

2506
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,730
- That's 20.
- That's cool.

2507
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,460
- I know.
- It's nice to have a lot.

2508
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,120
- He still has many left.
- That's 20.

2509
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,070
- Thirty six.
- Do I put it anywhere?

2510
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:57,940
I'll draw one more here.

2511
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,540
Eight is mine.

2512
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:00,940
Fifty six.

2513
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,610
I'm taking seven.

2514
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:03,980
Sure. Take it.

2515
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:05,950
Shin Rok.

2516
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:08,150
- Take it.
- Ji Hyo.

2517
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,080
What if Jae Suk doesn't become one?

2518
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,870
- That might happen.
- That's also his luck.

2519
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:15,340
I'm getting nervous.
Will I become lucky?

2520
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,620
(Who will become the owner
of Soonbak?)

2521
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,880
In the end, it's a family fight.

2522
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,080
(Who will become the owner
of Soonbak?)

2523
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:21,190
- Is this the chairman?
- Yes.

2524
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:24,250
The first number becomes
the vice chairman.

2525
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,870
The second number becomes
the chairman.

2526
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:28,120
- The first one is the chairman.
- The vice chairman.

2527
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,260
- The first one's the vice chairman?
- They both might be his number.

2528
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:31,500
What if he gets both numbers?

2529
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,500
Then he'll take both positions.

2530
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,110
- Really?
- Okay.

2531
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:35,410
Go.

2532
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,500
- But as a major shareholder,
- Pick one.

2533
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:40,610
the first number should be
the chairman for a higher chance.

2534
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,040
- You're right.
- That makes sense.

2535
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,320
- If you say so.
- Am I right?

2536
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,320
Who will pick the number?

2537
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,150
The guest?

2538
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:47,790
- The guest?
- Okay.

2539
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:49,320
- Are we picking the chairman?
- It's the chairman.

2540
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:50,450
- The chairman?
- The chairman?

2541
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:51,910
- The chairman.
- We'll pick the chairman.

2542
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:53,160
- Are we picking the chairman?
- Yes.

2543
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,450
- The guest will pick one.
- It's mine.

2544
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:56,250
Jae Suk. Don't complain.

2545
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,420
- Of course.
- Don't complain later.

2546
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:58,960
- Number 74.
- He can't help it.

2547
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,870
- Okay.
- It should be my number.

2548
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,760
- The chairman.
- Number 74.

2549
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:17,410
(Jae Suk was on a roll
with his extreme luck.)

2550
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:19,530
- How is that possible?
- It's 14.

2551
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:23,320
(He even stopped himself
unlike usual.)

2552
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:27,230
(Will Jae Suk with 45 percent
become the chairman?)

2553
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:28,640
You never know.

2554
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,600
- Lady luck is never on my side.
- You never know.

2555
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,140
- Number 14.
- That means I'm unfortunate.

2556
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:34,530
- Stay still.
- I'm nervous.

2557
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:36,680
- What is it?
- Will I be lucky?

2558
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,350
The chairman?

2559
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,180
What's the number?

2560
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,020
- Number 9.
- Number 9.

2561
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,280
- Number 9.
- Number 9.

2562
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:46,890
Yang Se Chan.

2563
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:48,520
I'm the chairman.

2564
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,230
- Number nine.
- What?

2565
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:54,120
(Chairman Yang Se Chan)

2566
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,700
I'm the chairman.

2567
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:58,860
- That's unbelievable.
- I won.

2568
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,960
- He...
- I'm the chairman.

2569
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,640
(A bolt out of the blue)

2570
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,140
(Jae Suk failed even though
he has 45 percent.)

2571
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,350
The youngest son is the chairman.

2572
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:13,950
He was a beggar.

2573
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:15,150
How many do you have?

2574
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:16,740
- He only has ten percent.
- Four?

2575
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:18,390
- You never know.
- Chairman Yang.

2576
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:20,150
You must not forget me.
I let you join at the end.

2577
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:21,610
Chairman Yang.

2578
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:24,110
- Don't forget I gave you one more.
- Well done.

2579
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:26,580
- You never know.
- Well done.

2580
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,530
- Chairman Yang.
- How is that possible?

2581
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:29,930
You know I let you join at the end.

2582
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:30,950
- Of course, I know.
- You know?

2583
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:32,460
Chairman Yang.

2584
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,030
- Se Chan.
- Chairman Yang.

2585
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:35,940
- You're amazing.
- How dare you.

2586
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,440
You're truly amazing.

2587
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,140
Let's pick the vice chairman.

2588
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:40,740
- You're awesome.
- Oh, my.

2589
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,940
How did you pick that
of all numbers?

2590
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,950
- Does it make sense?
- Pick one, sir.

2591
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:46,700
- Pick one.
- Now, it's the vice chairman.

2592
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:47,700
- Let me pick one.
- If I don't become one...

2593
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,020
You're picking your assistant.

2594
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,410
- I have so many shares.
- Please pick number 87.

2595
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:52,740
- Okay.
- Got it.

2596
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,860
- What is it?
- The number is...

2597
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,860
Tell me the first number.

2598
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,780
- The first number.
- Two digits or one?

2599
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:00,030
- Two digits.
- Two digits.

2600
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,430
- What's the first number?
- All right.

2601
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:03,820
- Fifty...
- Fifty...

2602
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,070
- Fifty...
- Gosh.

2603
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:06,530
- I'm not there.
- It's Jae Suk.

2604
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:07,820
- Fifty.
- It's Jae Suk.

2605
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,770
- It's you.
- It's Jae Suk.

2606
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:11,900
- It's Jae Suk.
- It's Jae Suk.

2607
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,960
- There's no tension at all.
- The vice chairman.

2608
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,330
- He became the vice chairman.
- Only if I didn't switch it.

2609
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:18,500
Hey. Go be his assistant.

2610
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,540
- Hurry up.
- Congratulations.

2611
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:20,850
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

2612
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:23,520
The chairman to lead
Soonbak Group is...

2613
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,040
- Yang Se Chan.
- You're amazing.

2614
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,750
- It's honey.
- It's meat.

2615
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,150
Korean beef for the chairman.

2616
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:34,390
Luxury honey for the vice chairman.

2617
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:35,430
(Prime Korean beef and honey
for the chairman and vice chairman)

2618
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,930
- Let's hear from the chairman.
- Yes.

2619
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:39,860
Thank you.

2620
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,740
How did that beggar
become the chairman?

2621
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:45,240
- I'm the chairman.
- He doesn't look like one.

2622
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,740
It's the same as the drama.

2623
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,530
Song Joong Ki takes all at the end.

2624
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:49,830
- He's the youngest.
- "Song Joong Ki."

2625
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:52,850
You look so different
from the drama.

2626
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:54,310
- I may look different.
- He's the real life version.

2627
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:57,150
I didn't become the chairman alone.
You all helped me.

2628
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:58,210
- Right.
- It's amazing.

2629
01:26:58,210 --> 01:26:59,610
He even learned a lesson.

2630
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:01,110
- There was none.
- There was none.

2631
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:03,710
The first number was supposed
to be the vice chairman.

2632
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:05,950
- He changed it.
- But you changed it.

2633
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:08,820
Everything depends on luck,
not effort.

2634
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,700
Shin Rok joined us today.

2635
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,070
It was so much fun.

2636
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:14,490
- Thank you.
- Tell us what you thought about it.

2637
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:16,940
It was so much fun. It snowed.

2638
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:20,900
I haven't played in the snow for so long.
It was so much fun.

2639
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,900
Let's give it up for Shin Rok again.

2640
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2641
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:28,070
Well done.

2642
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,110
(2023, the Year of Rabbit)

2643
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:32,950
(13 rabbits gathered.)

2644
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:35,690
(IVE is here.)

2645
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:37,580
(Ga Eul, Jang Won Young, An Yoo Jin,)

2646
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,320
(Rei, LIZ, LEESEO)

2647
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:40,430
You're so pretty.

2648
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:42,320
(I know I'm pretty.)

2649
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,530
(The earnest and bold
variety show idols...)

2650
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:45,030
(and pro entertainers volunteer
to become their role models.)

2651
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,600
(The national MC approaches
them smoothly.)

2652
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,440
Were you popular back in school?

2653
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,490
I had no friends.

2654
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,770
(I see.)

2655
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:53,070
(Time to check their talents)

2656
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,780
(Blowing)

2657
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:55,940
This is your last chance.

2658
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:58,610
(Even the national MC struggles
to lead the show.)

2659
01:27:58,610 --> 01:27:59,610
(He turns over a new leaf.)

2660
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:00,610
Say pass if you don't count.

2661
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:01,980
Pass.

2662
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,110
(It's going to be a long day today.)

2663
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:05,240
Bunny.

2664
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,650
(The two groups never get along.)

2665
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:08,110
(Will they become friends?)

2666
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,280
(Despite the chaos,)

2667
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,530
there's one rabbit
with no liver hiding.

2668
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:14,120
(Who's the intruder
that fooled everyone?)

2669
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:15,250
(Rabbit with No Liver)
