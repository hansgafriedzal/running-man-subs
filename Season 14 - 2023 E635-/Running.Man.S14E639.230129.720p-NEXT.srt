00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,790
Hello.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,130
I think this place is
for rich people.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,130
What is this place for?

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,070
I think I saw this in a movie.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,190
What is this place for?

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,910
I think this place is
for rich people.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,270
I think this is for a concert.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,470
- Look at this.
- My gosh.

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,110
- I bet it's for a concert.
- My goodness.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,040
I live in Gangnam, but I had no idea
there was a place like this.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,700
- I didn't know that either.
- This is cool.

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,880
You don't know
because you rarely go out.

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,380
I almost died without having been
to a place like this.

14
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,190
This is really nice.

15
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,880
Why would you talk about dying
so early in the morning?

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,830
A joke like this works for you now.

17
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,500
- Right.
- What about it?

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,400
- It sounds sincere.
- Now you're old enough...

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,720
to talk about the next world.

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,940
The thing is, we are having...

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,140
IVE for today's guests.

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,760
- That's right. IVE is coming.
- I read an article.

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,230
I read an article about that.

24
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,760
- There were a lot of articles.
- IVE.

25
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,580
Hey, Se Chan even lost weight...

26
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,870
- because IVE was coming.
- Suk Jin.

27
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,180
- Look at him.
- Think about that.

28
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,750
How can I lose weight only in a week
just because IVE is coming?

29
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,870
He lost weight.

30
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,220
He even went to a beauty shop.

31
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,940
Why would I do that because of IVE?

32
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,790
Se Chan got his hair done.

33
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,460
Suk Jin, you look nice today.

34
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,650
- Do you like this?
- I like your pants.

35
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,390
- When I got these pants...
- They are cute.

36
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,650
Doesn't he look like a gypsy?

37
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,060
There's flour.

38
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,560
- Gypsy? How dare you...
- Suk Jin.

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,830
You got some flour on your shoes.

40
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,340
I see. So these shoes are
from back then.

41
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,970
- Back when we...
- It wasn't a long time ago.

42
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,000
- It's from Reborn Spitefully Rich.
- I often wear...

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,310
- the same shoes.
- It's flour.

44
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,580
- I see.
- You can wear the same shoes again.

45
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,950
Of course.
You know I'm not so picky.

46
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,370
Hey, are you Daddy Long Legs or what?

47
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,450
(Long)

48
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,840
- What is it you're standing on?
- Hey.

49
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,280
- Ji Hyo.
- I'm wearing heels today.

50
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,220
- My gosh.
- You look so tall.

51
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,560
- Too tall.
- I looked at her like this.

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,030
Why are you so tall today?

53
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,920
It's the New Year,
so I'm wearing heels.

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,590
- She wears heels a lot these days.
- I know.

55
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,830
Is that because IVE is coming?

56
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,890
- Because of IVE?
- Like you just said, we have...

57
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,470
- special guests today.
- Yes, we do.

58
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,790
They even prepared
a special performance for you.

59
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,870
Really? I love IVE.

60
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,370
We're so lucky.

61
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,640
- I know.
- I love "Love Dive."

62
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,500
- I like IVE.
- Please come on out.

63
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,200
- Where are they?
- There they are.

64
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,540
There's IVE.

65
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,080
- Yoo Jin.
- Hey.

66
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,640
(They are the ones who swept
awards ceremonies with mega hits.)

67
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,190
- Ga Eul.
- Welcome.

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,480

They're here.

72

It's "Eleven."

73
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,160
Are they performing "Love Dive?"

74
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,630
It's "Love Dive."

75
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,710
This is interesting.

76
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,310
We go to the same gym.
It's crazy to see her here.

77
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,780
I often see her at the gym.

78
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,070
They're so pretty.

- IVE.
- Gosh.

They are the members of my gym.

- I'm so grateful.
- Me too.

102
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,870
- It's so nice.
- I can't believe they're here.

103
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,780
They must be happy to be here
because we like them.

104

There he goes again.

105
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,310
He says that all the time.

106
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,910
- Seriously, this is embarrassing.
- Let's be honest.

107
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,220
They must be as happy as we're now.

108
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,590
- Yes, we are.
- Of course, we're happy.

109

And I'm sure they are
happy to be on Running Man.

110
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,190
I'm so sorry.

111
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,060
It's not an overstatement...

112
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,400
to say the year 2022 was IVE's year.

113
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,090
We look forward to their exploits
in this year as well.

114
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,090
So we're going to have
an in-depth conversation with them.

115
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,240
- All right.
- That sounds like a good idea.

116
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,000
It will be hosted...

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,370
by the nation's beloved MC,
Yoo Jae Suk...

118
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,970
- and his assistant MC he picked.
- An assistant MC? Then...

119
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,650
- It's definitely him.
- Assistant MC.

120
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,990
Suk Jin does assist me well,
but sometimes he acts up.

121
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,850
- Let's see him assist.
- Let's watch.

122
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,490
Let's see how he does
after "Star Golden Bell."

123
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,790
I used to deal...

124
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,560
- with 20 people at a time.
- Right. He's a star.

125
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,320
I took care of everything myself.

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,930
So this is what I wonder.

127
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,300
We have LIZ
and other members of IVE here.

128
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,600
I wonder what they think
Suk Jin's real job is.

129
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,040
- Go ahead and say it.
- Do you know?

130

131
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,830
His real job.

132
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,180
His real job. Just tell us...

133
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,540
- how you feel.
- His real job?

134
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,750
Yes. His real job.

135
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,180
- An office worker.
- A small business owner.

136
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,370
A fertilizer sack.

137
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,550
A comedian?

138
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,940
(A comedian?)

139
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,290
But he was a singer.

140
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,420
- That's true.
- He used to be a singer.

141
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,080
- That's how I started my career.
- He was a singer.

142
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,450
- Really?
- You didn't know, did you?

143
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,950
- I debuted like...
- He started as a singer.

144
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,430
thirty years before you.

145
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,800
(Surprised)

146
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,730
- Do you know "I Know?"
- You're our senior.

147
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,890
My song was released on LP, CD,

148
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,460
and cassette all at the same time.

149
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,300
- I was the first generation.
- He's a senior artist.

150
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,110
Did you see that?
You know what this means.

151
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,330
- "Yes."
- "Enough."

152
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,330
- "All right. It's over."
- They give me a big hand.

153
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,330
"That's enough, so stop it."

154
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,940
And she gives two thumbs-up.

155
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,350
Stop talking.

156
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,940
Stop talking.

157
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,850
- This is what it is.
- Stop talking now.

158
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,210
Are you pressing your thumbs...

159
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,560
- against his lips?
- Yes, that's it.

160
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,120
- Like this?
- "I want to shut your mouth."

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,730
- Stop talking.
- It's not two thumbs-up.

162
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,500
- I didn't know.
- You shouldn't do that.

163
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,500
I'll pick an assistant MC then.

164
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,100
- I want Seok Sam.
- All right.

165
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,390
- Go up.
- He gets mad if I don't pick him.

166
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,670
He will say something like this.

167
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,610
"Hey, I'm an experienced MC."

168
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,480
(The old rookie is selected
thanks to his experience.)

169
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,330
- Seok Sam, come here.
- I don't say that.

170
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,750
- Go up.
- Assist him.

171
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,250
So we have the six members...

172
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,710

173
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,010
- Welcome.
- Running Man...

174
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,990
- often has idol guests,
- We do.

175
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,490
But they mostly play some games...

176
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,320
- and leave.
- That's true.

177
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,820
Now that they're here,

178
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,500
- we should get to know them better.
- We don't know them well.

179
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,060
The thing is,

180
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,830
this must be meaningful to IVE.

181
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,240
It's not easy to be on Running Man
as a whole band.

182
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,330
I'm sorry, but...

183
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,770
It's not the assistant MC
who invited them here.

184
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,240
You kind of kill the mood.

185
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,140
- You're supposed to assist.
- Why are you acting out of line?

186
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,000
I think it's a problem...

187
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,750
- when an MC sounds bossy.
- Right.

188
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,250
He sounds too bossy.

189
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,440
- IVE must be feeling nervous now.
- You should make them comfortable.

190
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,210
All right.
She tells you to stop talking.

191
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,990
- Stop talking.
- It's two thumbs-up.

192
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,250
Pressing his philtrum.

193
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,560
I'll talk to them one by one.

194
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,300
- First, we have An Yoo Jin.
- Yes.

195
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,260
Yoo Jin, you were born
in the Year of the Sheep.

196
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,760
- Yes.
- That's the year I was born in.

197
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,240
Really? I was born...

198
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,260
- in the Year of the Sheep.
- Really?

199
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,500
But he's an old sheep.

200
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,870
- He's an old sheep.
- And she's a lamb.

201
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,070
- He's old.
- Are we 24 years apart?

202
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,480
- Is that 24 years?
- Really, 24 years?

203
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,570
My goodness. You're
24 years older than her.

204
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,870
He's such an old sheep.

205
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,440
So...

206
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,810
her specialties are hanok challenge
and singing with an echo effect.

207
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,140
I watched it before.

208
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,660
- You did?
- Singing with an echo effect.

209
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,950
I've never heard of that.

210
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,160
Yoo Jin.

211
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,360
- Like karaoke?
- I know what it is.

212
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,880
- I watched it too.
- She's really good.

213
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,820
- She did really well.
- It's Yoo Jin's specialty. Show us.

214
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,390
- She's different.
- She's really good.

215
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,690
I'll sing "Snow Flower."

216
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,940
Suddenly as I flowed

217
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,610
Your growing shadow

218
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,870
And this is our song.

219
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,310
My boring eyes

220
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,140
The expressionless face

221
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,810
- Isn't this from "Gag Concert?"
- Just stay quiet.

222
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,010
Come on.

223
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,010
(The assistant MC
kills the mood again.)

224
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,060
- It was going well.
- Please.

225
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,820
- Mister!
- Hang on a second.

226
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,660
"My beloved..."

227
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,100
(Suspicion of an homage
to "Gag Concert" from 10 years ago)

228
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,800
- Why would you bring that up?
- That's the worst.

229
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,910
- Mister!
- Hang on a second.

230
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,370
Se Chan, switch.

231
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,940
- "My beloved..."
- Suk Jin, go.

232
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,180
- "My beloved..."
- Go away.

233
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,640
- Go away.
- Just go.

234
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,070
- I can't believe this.
- What was that?

235
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,180
- "Gag Concert?"
- Suk Jin.

236
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,980
- They did this before.
- Stop it.

237
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,640
Did I just get kicked out?

238
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,080
- You sit here.
- Just listen.

239
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,560
Go sit over there.

240
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,430
- What's wrong with what I said?
- You ruined it.

241
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,060
You brought her down.

242
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,230
- Suk Jin.
- All right. Two thumbs-up.

243
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,820
What goes around comes around.

244
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,520
- You're really good.
- Thank you.

245
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,170
They say you have two different egos
as an idol and an entertainer.

246
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,600
You're a good entertainer
on variety shows.

247
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,180
What are you like as an idol artist?

248
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,310
You look so pretty.

249
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,150
That's so flattering. Thank you.

250
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,570
So she sounds modest.

251
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,740
(She sounds modest as an idol.)

252
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,920
She sounds calm.

253
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,420
So she sounds modest.

254
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,550
But what are you like
on a variety show?

255
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,610
You look so pretty.

256
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,790
I know I do!

257
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,560
(I know I do!)

258
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,690
You look so pretty.

259
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,820
I know I do!

260
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,760
(She admits it in a cool way.)

261
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,300
- I'm pretty.
- That's nice.

262
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,560
I feel so comfortable.

263
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,460
- I feel so comfortable.
- I like that.

264
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,090
- She's just like So Min.
- I like that.

265
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,540
- I feel so comfortable.
- I like that.

266
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,540
- She's just like So Min.
- I like that.

267
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,410
- That's nice.
- I'm pretty.

268
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,200
- "I'm pretty."
- She's so cheerful.

269
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,470
I like that.

270
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,100
- That's nice.
- I'm pretty.

271
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,920
I like that, Yoo Jin.

272
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,050
- She's different.
- She sounds just like So Min.

273
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,310
So Min looks so proud.

274
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,810
- So Min and Yoo Jin are similar.
- I know.

275
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,260
- She's just my style.
- I know.

276
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,820
- She's my role model.
- That's true.

277
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,480
- You're my style.
- She is her role model.

278
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,900
Is So Min your role model?

279
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,220
- Yes.
- All right.

280
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,090
As a lot of people know,
she made her debut on "Produce 48."

281
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,670
- I see.
- That's how she debuted...

282
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,940
- as an idol artist.
- Wait.

283
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,460
Is Se Chan a mascot or something?

284
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,440
I don't have much to do here.

285
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,970
I just need
to listen carefully to him.

286
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,470
"I see."

287
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,680
You're just like us.

288
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,440
We're just like IVE.

289
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,180
- That's why he's good.
- He's good.

290
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,650
I just say things like, "I see."

291
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,210
- He makes an agreeable response.
- I do.

292
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,480
- So...
- To tell me that I'm doing well.

293
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,160
you should just sit there
like a puppet.

294
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,160
- That looks quite nice.
- I know.

295
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,890
So...

296
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,560
- You should read this.
- Which one?

297
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,820
I see.

298
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,270
They say your nickname is
An Yoo Jae Suk.

299
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
An Yoo Jae Suk?

300
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,140
- Is that true?
- Because her name is An Yoo Jin.

301
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,440
- Are you a good MC?
- The thing is,

302
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,830
I try to be an MC
when I'm with the members.

303
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,880
What do you think?
Tell us what she's like.

304
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,780
What do you think?
Tell us what she's like.

305
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,110
(What?)

306
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,550
Are you tired now?

307
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,020
- Her eyes lost their focus.
- No.

308
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,840
You were spacing out.

309
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,950
- Do you not want me to talk to you?
- I was listening.

310
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,820
- Are you all right?
- Looking straight ahead.

311
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,320
It will be your turn soon.

312
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,160
I don't think Rei was looking ahead.

313
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,530
She was somewhat like...

314
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,190
- What's wrong?
- Rei, relax. It's okay.

315
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,960
Let's move on to Ga Eul.

316
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,040
- Senior Ga Eul.
- Senior Ga Eul.

317
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,010
She's the oldest member of the team.

318
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,330
- Really?
- Yes.

319
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,910
- Who?
- She's 22.

320
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,280
Her introduction is quite unique.
I'd like to hear that.

321
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,410
Your introduction
as a member of IVE.

322
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,290
Hello, I'm Ga Eul of IVE,
the fairy on the team.

323
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,740
- A fairy?
- My goodness.

324
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,450
Aren't S.E.S fairies?

325
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,850
- A fairy.
- A fairy?

326
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,190
- Fairies last forever.
- So Ga Eul is a fairy.

327
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,820
What about you, Won Young?

328
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,030
- Irreplaceable charm.
- Irreplaceable charm?

329
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,320
So you still use
expressions like that.

330
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,940
- Do you still do that?
- The word still works.

331
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,270
- What about you, Yoo Jin?
- I'm Jeon So Min.

332
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,330
What are you?

333
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,810
Jae Suk, let So Min
introduce herself.

334
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,810
- So Min, you have something?
- She came up with this on her own.

335
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,410
What is it?

336
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,070
Hello. I'm Jeon So Min
with an addictive charm...

337
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,110
that you recall
before you fall asleep.

338
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,420
"Addictive charm."

339
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,310
(Lengthy)

340
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,580
"Addictive charm."

341
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,190
(You will recall her shamelessness
before you fall asleep.)

342
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,130
"Addictive charm."

343
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,950
- It's so embarrassing.
- It sounds...

344
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,220
like a very old expression.

345
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,060
- I can work on it.
- It's hilarious.

346
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,630
That was funny.

347
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,960
It's fun.

348
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,230
Do you often eat alone?

349
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,770
But there's one thing
I haven't tried yet.

350
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,540
I never went
to a barbecue restaurant on my own.

351
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,140
- Pork belly?
- You should come to my restaurant.

352
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,830
I ate tenderloin and eels
in a restaurant alone.

353
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,810
- Really? Can you order one serving?
- Yes.

354
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,610
- No, you can't.
- They don't sell one serving.

355
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,780
I ate one serving
and ordered porridge to go.

356
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,520
- You ordered takeout.
- I see.

357
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,920
Then you can order one serving.

358
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,710
They thought I was pregnant.

359
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,260
(They thought I was pregnant.)

360
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,660
So they...

361
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,400
You can't say that
to young girls like them.

362
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,220
- Hey, So Min.
- Wait.

363
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,820
- So Min.
- We don't know how to react.

364
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,360
- I don't know what to say.
- Come on.

365
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,090
People don't usually go
to a barbecue restaurant alone.

366
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,670
My role model.

367
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,960
But I went there by myself...

368
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,230
- and ate meat.
- She's unbelievable.

369
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,700
That's funny.

370
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,910
(You will recall her silly remark
before you fall asleep.)

371
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,310
Back in high school, you were
called The Beauty of the School...

372
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,050
as you looked like Seolhyun
and Actress Shin Hyun Been.

373
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,550
- What?
- She was famous for her beauty.

374
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,790
You were called like that?

375
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,650
I didn't know that.

376
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,660
- The members didn't know?
- No.

377
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,560
I went to girls' middle school
and girls' high school.

378
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,820
- I was popular...
- Among your friends?

379
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,930
Yes. I was popular among my friends.

380
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,990
I bet you were.

381
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,990
- I can imagine.
- They all have pretty faces.

382
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,800
So Min and Ji Hyo
were just like that.

383
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,990
- That's not the case for me.
- They are like your seniors.

384
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,440
- Right. Your senior.
- Not me.

385
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,730
She was just popular.

386
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,640
- She was just popular.
- She was a boss.

387
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,600
Rei, weren't you called
like that back in school?

388
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,840
- Me?
- Yes.

389
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,680
- I had no friends.
- Why not?

390
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,980
(I see.)

391
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,150
No friend at all?

392
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,310
Not even one friend?

393
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,810
Things are not working out with her.

394
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,390
Don't wrap things up yet.
We still have a long way to go.

395
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,480
- Please.
- Don't give up.

396
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,790
Please hang in there.

397
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,030
- I just...
- Please.

398
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,820
I just lost my desire to talk.

399
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,030
- Please, Jae Suk.
- All right.

400
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,720
- We can do this.
- All right.

401
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,090
- Hang in there. You can do this.
- Okay. We should do this.

402
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,900
Let's move on to Rei.

403
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,230
- Rei, you...
- Are you going to be all right?

404
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,310
I need to pull myself together.

405
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,310
Take a deep breath. Take it slow.

406
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,910
- It can take an hour. Take it slow.
- Okay. Let's take it slow.

407
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,570
- We can do this.
- We have a lot to do today.

408
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,740
Let's do this, Rei.

409
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,150
- You support him well.
- So...

410
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,740
About Rei...

411
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,440
Your real name is Naoi Rei.

412
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,310
- That's right.
- Is that correct?

413
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,690
You're in charge of rapping...

414
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,130
and have a lovely
and unique charm. Right?

415
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,450
You can't just read it.

416
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,530
You should ask questions.

417
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,090
- You're just reading it?
- Please ask questions.

418
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,590
It doesn't happen a lot that I'm
afraid to ask someone a question.

419
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,540
- But I'm afraid.
- Let's go for it.

420
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,670
Okay.

421
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,600
You like four-syllable words.

422
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,730
Right. Four-syllable words.

423
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,100
- Like what?
- She must like idioms.

424
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,680
What I found novel was...

425
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,180
- the word, "anyway."
- Anyway?

426
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,310
The members know that.

427
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,020
- Do you like the word?
- When do you use the word?

428
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,680
- When she needs to make a decision.
- Right.

429
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,810
"I think this will be nice anyway."
She always adds the word.

430
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,580
Why do you like the word so much?

431
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,920
Because it's a four-syllable word.

432
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,520
What?

433
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,530
Because it's a four-syllable word.

434
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,790
(Because it's a four-syllable word.)

435
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,060
What on earth?

436
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,430
- "Because..."
- She cut him off completely.

437
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,860
- There isn't a bottom consonant.
- She's not wrong though.

438
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,960
- Jae Suk, get a grip on yourself.
- It's a four-syllable word.

439
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,540
- A 4-syllable word?
- Yes, it's a 4-syllable word.

440
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,700
You sometimes come across
people like her.

441
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,640
- Rei, I hear you.
- You should overcome this.

442
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,070
Yes, I should overcome it. Good.

443
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,010
Give her a book
on four-syllable Chinese idioms,

444
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,570
and she'll have fun all on her own.

445
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,240
What's your take on "gyeoksejigam?"

446
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,390
- That...
- It's a bit too hard for her.

447
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,840
- It's not that cool.
- What about "ilseokyijo?"

448
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,690
- You don't find that cool?
- No.

449
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,480
(What makes you the best
is that you're honest.)

450
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,560
Are you all right?

451
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,220
It's okay.

452
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,130
- She doesn't find it cool.
- You're halfway there.

453
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,770
I get that Chinese idioms
aren't all that cool,

454
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,690
but they're way better
than words like "because."

455
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,690
- Those four syllables...
- But...

456
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,960
- contain various meanings.
- What about "surreptitiously?"

457
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,380
Is it true that you like
the word "whatever?"

458
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,600
Yes, I used to love saying that.

459
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,550
Can you do the longer version of it
with the TV and fridge?

460
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,680
- No, I can't, but...
- I see.

461
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,150
I also like saying
I'm ticked off and...

462
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,310
You both failed,
so step down from there.

463
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,390
- This won't do.
- No, wait.

464
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,920
- Get back here.
- I...

465
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,130
- It's okay.
- Yes, she's hard to win over.

466
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,220
She won't let us in.

467
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,060
Rei isn't an easy one to crack.

468
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,130
So that was Rei.
We'll now move on to Won Young.

469
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,360
- We'll talk to Won Young next.
- Hi.

470
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Hey, Won Young.

471
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,730
Her talent is her prettiness.

472
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,770
- What more can you say?
- No way.

473
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,060
- She can confidently say that.
- It's written down here.

474
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,410
- It's cool that you can say that.
- I see.

475
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,100
- Her talent is her prettiness.
- How does one do that?

476
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,970
Don't you agree though?

477
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,840
- I do.
- I also agree.

478
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,650
Can you do what Yoo Jin did earlier?

479
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,790
She stood up and struck some poses.

480
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,560
Can we ask that of you as well?

481
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,950
Should I mimic the situation
or strike some poses?

482
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,450
- The poses.
- Strike poses of a certain vibe.

483
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,930
- That enhances my looks?
- That's right.

484
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,060
I'm dying to see this.

485
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,320
- Then...
- Could you stand up?

486
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,130
- Can you call for me from behind?
- Okay, I like that.

487
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,860
- Why don't you walk over there?
- Go ahead.

488
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,690
- Here we go.
- I'll turn to this camera.

489
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,960
Sure thing.

490
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,970
- I'll turn around thoughtlessly.
- Sure thing.

491
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,200
What's the time?

492
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Won Young.

493
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,810
Yes?

494
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,020
Who took a photo just now?

495
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,680
(Hold on.)

496
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,260
- Who took a photo?
- Someone took a photo.

497
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,420
Who was it?

498
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,290
(The sound of a shutter
resonated in the silent auditorium.)

499
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,100
(The PR team
couldn't help themselves.)

500
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,340
- Someone took a photo.
- Who was it?

501
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,510
- Who was it?
- Show yourself.

502
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,870
(The person
was quickly apprehended.)

503
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,160
- Who do you think you are?
- Who was it?

504
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,510
Who are you?

505
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,880
- He's from SBS.
- I heard the sound of a shutter.

506
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,300
- He's from the PR team.
- Who are you?

507
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,650
- He's from the PR team.
- You're inspiring though.

508
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,940
- You didn't just turn around.
- I added a wink.

509
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,490
- You also winked.
- As if something were in my eye.

510
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,410
Let us call for you
in a different way this time.

511
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,910
Go ahead.

512
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,020
Won Young.

513
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,060
(She slows it down herself.)

514
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,800
- She slowed it down herself.
- It was in slo-mo.

515
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,260
That was nice.

516
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,960
- It was in slo-mo.
- As if I wasn't expecting it.

517
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,460
- I slowed it down.
- I'm impressed.

518
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,040
Like we said...

519
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,840
- She's really pretty.
- It sure is a talent.

520
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,230
- Thanks.
- Mi Joo and I...

521
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,080
- were in the green room...
- Yes?

522
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,740
- when Won Young appeared on TV.
- Really?

523
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,940
She looked at her and said,

524
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,440
"She has it all."

525
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,820
- Oh, no.
- It's true.

526
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,390
Even guys give up when we see men
who are too good looking.

527
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,980
- That was so cool.
- We give you that.

528
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,300
- We can only agree.
- Yes, we admit you're pretty.

529
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,600
- Thank you.
- In 2022...

530
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,830
We'll now move on to LIZ.

531
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,070
- LIZ.
- Your real name is Kim Ji Won.

532
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,140
- Yes.
- And you're the lead vocalist.

533
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,870
I hear you have the most
special talents in the group.

534
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,500
- Yes, I guess you can say that.
- You seem talented.

535
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,970
- What can you do?
- Can you show us something?

536
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,400
- Could it be...
- I have something new to show you.

537
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,170
I practiced this
to present on Running Man.

538
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,050
- Really? That's what we should see.
- We're grateful.

539
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,280
- That's what we should see.
- It's something new.

540
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,480
Here we go.

541
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,710
And go.

542
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,600
Who are you doing an impression of?

543
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,450
Is it Christina?

544
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,720
- Hold on a second.
- Tell us who it is first.

545
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,490
- We should know who this is.
- Was that Italian?

546
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,900
- Let us guess instead.
- You have to guess.

547
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,840
- Is it Christina?
- Let us guess.

548
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,310
Was it Maenggu?

549
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,780
- Let us guess.
- Was it Maenggu?

550
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,000
Show us once again.

551
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,940
- I wasn't done.
- She wasn't done.

552
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,820
- Liz, try that again.
- Let's listen.

553
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,970
Go ahead.

554
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,940
- It's a quiz.
- All right.

555
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,390
How many people are you mimicking?

556
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,130
- Hold on a second.
- There's no need to confront her.

557
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,130
- Let her finish.
- I'm sure it wasn't over.

558
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,460
- Let her finish.
- I'm scared.

559
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,840
- You guys are scary.
- It's okay. You can overcome this.

560
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,430
- Are you mimicking three people?
- They're not angry, guys.

561
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,930
- Also...
- What is it?

562
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,500
- It's too strict here.
- This is something new, right?

563
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,580
- Let them be at ease.
- Exactly.

564
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,200
Yes, be at ease.

565
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,280
- We only want to guess the answer.
- Of course.

566
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,320
I hear you can also mimic...

567
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,050
- the sound of an ocarina.
- That's right.

568
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,820
Can you show us?

569
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,440
Here I go.

570
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,860
You did it well earlier though.

571
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,150
(The sound of air)

572
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,600
- You did it well earlier though.
- Try that again.

573
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,860
It's because of her sweaty palms.
Wipe them first.

574
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,190
Wipe them dry.

575
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,130
This is your last chance.

576
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,100
(In comes
another strict drill sergeant.)

577
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,340
I'm sorry about that.

578
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,730
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on.

579
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,900
- Mister!
- Are you the drill sergeant?

580
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry about that.

581
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
It's all right.

582
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,400
We all get three chances.

583
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,440
Go ahead. It's okay.

584
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,110
IVE has been
on many variety shows before,

585
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,550
but I doubt
any of them were like this.

586
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,780
- It's icy cold in here.
- Right.

587
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,650
- We're old-fashioned.
- We're strict.

588
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,180
- Please show us.
- We're mostly strict.

589
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,320
- One last try.
- Okay.

590
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,790
- I heard a sound.
- You're doing it.

591
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,920
- It's working.
- Keep going.

592
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,490
You failed.

593
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,920
- She made a sound though.
- Then...

594
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,800
- I did make a sound.
- I'll erase that...

595
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,540
from your lists of talents.

596
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,110
- Cross that out.
- We got to know about LIZ.

597
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,900
- Lastly, we'll talk to LEESEO.
- The youngest member.

598
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,730
- It's finally my turn.
- Her real name is Lee Hyun Seo.

599
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,670
- She's 17.
- The vibrant youngest member.

600
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,620
Winking quickly is your talent?

601
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,120
That...

602
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,590
- In ten seconds?
- It was a talent of mine,

603
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,560
but Won Young turned out
to be better at it.

604
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,590
- You stole it from her.
- She stole her talent.

605
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,390
- It's understandable.
- We'll cross that one out...

606
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,560
- and say Won Young stole it.
- It was stolen.

607
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,100
Won Young stole her talent.

608
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,800
I want to see it though.

609
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,900
How fast can you wink?

610
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,630
- I'll show you.
- Sure.

611
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,110
- That's really fast.
- You're good at it.

612
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,460
- Really?
- Yes.

613
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,200
- That was fast.
- How fast can Won Young do it?

614
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,730
I do it with just one eye,

615
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,500
- not both.
- Please show us.

616
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,740
- I do it with one eye.
- Is it different?

617
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,010
You're not kidding. No way.

618
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,940
- So Min winks really fast as well.
- With just one eye.

619
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,120
Steal that talent from her.

620
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,820
- So Min, let's see it.
- Have some magnesium.

621
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,680
- You need magnesium.
- You need vitamin D as well.

622
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,180
- She can wink really fast.
- I can do it too.

623
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,180
Go ahead.

624
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,530
- Forget it.
- Your lips twitch up.

625
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,570
Show us.

626
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,600
(Got you, didn't I?)

627
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,040
- Won Young...
- Ji Hyo, hold on.

628
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,300
Why can we see your grinders
when you're winking?

629
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,200
- Won Young.
- Hold on.

630
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,900
That's due to a lack of magnesium
in her system.

631
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,470
- How...
- It's lack of magnesium.

632
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,670
Anyway, we got to know IVE
a little more.

633
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,670
(IVE has been analyzed.)

634
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,110
Thank you.

635
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,710
- We now feel closer to IVE.
- We know them better.

636
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,320
- I know them now.
- Right?

637
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,510
Before we begin today's race,

638
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,250
you will play a game
that will decide your teams.

639
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,720
My Strength Is That
I'm the Best Dancer.

640
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,720
IVE has already been split
into teams of two,

641
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,190
and you will play the game
of Green Light, Red Light.

642
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,690
Unlike the basic rule,

643
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,500
the one who's It
will step forward while dancing.

644
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,700
The other member of IVE
will blow the whistle...

645
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,310
while watching
the Running Man members dance.

646
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,080
That will have you eliminated.

647
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,470
The remaining members
will join that team.

648
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,010
A total of three rounds
will take place.

649
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,790
Won Young and Rei are up first.

650
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,390
- Okay.
- Won Young and Rei.

651
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,680
Okay!

652
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,830
Is Won Young like the referee?

653
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,250
- That's better.
- Watch closely.

654
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,220
- Won Young will eliminate us.
- Watch closely.

655
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,190
I'll watch you dance
and eliminate you one by one.

656
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,260
Well, we...

657
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,070
We've been dancing
all our lives, right?

658
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,800
- Dancing is my life.
- Of course.

659
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,200
- We'll be on Rei's team, then.
- Even if you do the moves right,

660
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,310
I'll blow the whistle
if I'm not satisfied.

661
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,000
- Decide who you want on your team.
- Don't you worry.

662
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,440
She's strict, isn't she?

663
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,850
Let the music play.

664
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,550
Go ahead.

665
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,750
(She blows the whistle.)

666
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,330
Suk Jin, you're out.

667
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,600
Why?

668
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,040
- Suk Jin, you're out.
- Why?

669
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,140
But... Hold on.

670
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,610
- This...
- Nicely done.

671
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,660
- Nicely done, Won Young.
- Hold on a second.

672
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,500
- Nice job.
- Isn't this because she hates me?

673
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,310
- It seems to me like...
- Nicely done.

674
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,400
- The moves weren't that hard.
- It wasn't difficult.

675
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,350
- What's the reason?
- I love how she put it.

676
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,820
- I liked the tone.
- Hear me out.

677
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,050
His moves were completely off.

678
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,120
- Is that so?
- Yes.

679
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,180
- Something about him...
- I'm sure she was objective.

680
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,910
- It was this move, but...
- I understand.

681
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,030
I think his palms were open.

682
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,530
- It was this.
- Haha also mentioned this,

683
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,530
but her tone was hilarious.

684
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,060
- Exactly.
- "Suk Jin, you're out."

685
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,420
Suk Jin, you're out.

686
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,540
- Gosh.
- Suk Jin, you're out.

687
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,300
Oh, man. This isn't easy.

688
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,460
(The music is played again.)

689
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,230
- Is this song "Red Flavor?"
- Let's go! One, two!

690
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,140
Here goes a difficult move.

691
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,350
- What do I do?
- Here goes a difficult move.

692
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
What do I do?

693
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,010
- You're doing great.
- Oh, good. I'm doing it right.

694
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,150
(Way to go!)

695
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,980
(The whistle is blown.)

696
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,750
- Only he...
- Yoo Jae Suk is out!

697
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,450
(Changing his pose)

698
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,330
- She's so strict.
- Hey.

699
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,530
- She's so strict.
- Hold on.

700
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,430
- Won Young, you're so strict.
- "Yoo Jae Suk is out!"

701
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,960
- Wait. I'd like to...
- Won Young is quite strict.

702
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,000
- take back my decision.
- Why?

703
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,280
I think it's acceptable.

704
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,580
- Right. You can do that.
- Yes.

705
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,940
- Really?
- It's up to you.

706
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,550
- Yes. I want to let him off.
- Oh, I see. Okay.

707
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,170
But Jae Suk is out, right?

708
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,470
- No, he's not.
- He...

709
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,470
Isn't he out?

710
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,710
- What?
- Suk Jin, you're out.

711
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,090
- Isn't he out?
- Suk Jin, you're out.

712
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,390
Am I the only one to be eliminated?

713
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,330
Why won't you let me off?

714
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,720
- "You're out!"
- You get a yellow card instead.

715
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,190
- I'll give you a yellow card.
- A yellow card? Okay.

716
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,560
- Why can't I get a yellow card?
- I'll try harder from now on.

717
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,100
- That's great. Do your best.
- And those at the back,

718
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,960
- You're such a great dancer.
- make sure to do it properly.

719
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
- We're doing well.
- We're doing our best.

720
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,570
- We're doing our best.
- Now, play the music.

721
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,070
(The music is played.)

722
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,380
Hey, look at him.

723
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,740
Haha, you're out.

724
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,470
(Haha is out.)

725
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,350
- It's because...
- Yes.

726
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,940
- He looked too much from behind.
- I see.

727
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,180
- She had her reason.
- You stuck out your butt too much.

728
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,450
- Okay. I admit that.
- I'm next to Se Chan.

729
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,630
Referee,
you seem to like Jae Suk...

730
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,420
- too much.
- I did well this time, right?

731
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,660
That's not the point.

732
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,900
- Why...
- You're out.

733
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,490
- Good job!
- I mean...

734
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,070
- She favors Jae Suk.
- That's great.

735
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,730
- Jae Suk gets a yellow card.
- Okay.

736
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,170
- That's what he deserves.
- I didn't get eliminated.

737
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,470
- Right.
- He doesn't deserve to be out.

738
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,650
- And I'm good at dancing.
- He got another yellow card.

739
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,350
- He didn't do so poorly. Trust me.
- You heard her.

740
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,910
- Let's continue.
- Okay.

741
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,150
(There are 5 members left now!)

742
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,790
- Oh, my. They're cute.
- Indeed.

743
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,190
Hey!

744
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,690
(Moon Hee Joon's signature dance)

745
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,070
Wait. What is it? I can't see her.

746
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,870
- Who?
- Song Ji Hyo is out.

747
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,430
No. Why me?

748
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,460
Ji Hyo, she's right.
We can see why you're out.

749
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,640
- After this move, swing your arm.
- Ji Hyo, accept it.

750
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,380
- Was that it? I couldn't see it.
- That's what I did.

751
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,900
- Ji Hyo is out.
- I'm relieved.

752
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,670
- Gosh. I couldn't see it.
- I couldn't see her well.

753
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,670
Even I could see
you were doing it wrong.

754
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,980
- I expected to do this dance.
- I thought we'd do this dance.

755
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,050
- Right.
- Jae Suk, it's too hard for you.

756
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,120
- Understood. She's strict.
- Yes.

757
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,030
It's going to get harder.

758
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,450
(There are 4 members left now!)

759
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,100
- My hair is too short for that.
- My hair is too short.

760
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,300
I can't grab my hair like that.

761
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,070
You have to move further forward.

762
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,660
They're moving
in different directions.

763
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,580
They're all doing well.

764
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:32,120
(The dancers are starting to
get excited.)

765
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,410
Oh, gosh. What should I do?

766
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,750
- It's difficult.
- Oh, yes, treasure!

767
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,410
(The whistle is blown.)

768
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,860
- It's difficult.
- Yoo Jae Suk is out.

769
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,950
- I can't let you off this time.
- Why am I out?

770
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,370
- Unbelievable. Yoo Jin, tell her.
- Jae Suk was doing well.

771
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,830
- You were over the top.
- That's fair.

772
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,760
- I was doing so well.
- Listen.

773
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
- You got too excited.
- She's a fair referee.

774
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,200
- I got too excited? Is that it?
- Jae Suk, come here.

775
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
That's right. You were over the top.

776
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,260
- You were too frivolous.
- My gosh. I can't believe this.

777
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,580
That had a sort of American vibe.

778
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,880
But I really like that vibe.

779
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,440
- You're out.
- Gosh.

780
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,940
(The referee tells him
to stop acting up and leave.)

781
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,480
- She's rigid.
- She's so strict.

782
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,590
- She's strict, indeed.
- Won Young is...

783
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,210
- rigid.
- What a shame.

784
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,980
- We're like a mixed-gender group.
- Turbo is back.

785
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,750
- Stand in the middle, Jong Kook.
- We're a mixed-gender group.

786
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,890
- Jong Kook, stand in the middle.
- Okay.

787
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,830
- Let's begin the final round...
- I'm out of breath.

788
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,860
- with these three members.
- This is the final round?

789
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,900
- Those dance moves...
- It's difficult.

790
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,330
- were so difficult.
- The two of you who survive...

791
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,370
will team up with them.

792
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,830
- Only one of you will be out.
- The game will be over.

793
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,570
- Please play the music.
- I don't want to be eliminated.

794
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,460
You know, the two of you...

795
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,080
(The whistle is blown.)

796
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,740
- The member to be eliminated...
- Their foot positions are reversed.

797
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,890
lost her balance at the end.

798
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:45,950
Jeon So Min is out.

799
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,420
- Hey, we made it. This is great.
- Congratulations.

800
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,450
Jeon So Min is out.

801
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,920
(The final 2 survivors are
Se Chan and Jong Kook!)

802
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
- Hey, we made it.
- We made it!

803
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,990
- Actually...
- Are you sure?

804
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,230
- I didn't want to do it again.
- Okay.

805
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,230
- The first team has been formed.
- You see, Rei...

806
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,930
Next up are Yoo Jin and LEESEO.

807
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,110
- Yoo Jin and LEESEO.
- Okay.

808
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,440
- Oh, they...
- Yoo Jin and LEESEO?

809
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,650
- It's a strong team.
- Yoo Jin, do difficult dance moves.

810
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,280
- I danced so hard to survive.
- Please play the music.

811
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,120
- Let's go!
- I'll dance like crazy.

812
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,290
- Please play the music.
- I'm exhausted.

813
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,740
("Swallowtail" by Kim Heung Guk)

814
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,790
Oh, it's "Swallowtail."

815
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,510
(As his favorite song is played,)

816
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,920
(Suk Jin starts dancing
right away.)

817
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,990
A tiger.

(The whistle is blown.)

819
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,100
- Oh, no. I can't do that. Gosh.
- That was too difficult.

820
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,760
Suk Jin, you failed.

821
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,640
- Why me?
- He...

822
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,840
Suk Jin, you failed.

823
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,960
(He's the 1st member
to get eliminated again.)

824
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,700
- She said, "You failed."
- Why?

825
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,170
- But Yoo Jin...
- Why me?

826
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,170
- We didn't do much.
- You...

827
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,200
- Why...
- I didn't like it. At all.

828
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,850
- You didn't like it?
- LEESEO didn't know this dance.

829
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,650
- That's the original dance.
- This is the original dance.

830
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,150
Besides, I saw Yoo Jin
while we were dancing. She...

831
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,530
didn't see anyone else but Suk Jin.

832
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,150
- She looked at no one else.
- She stared at him, right?

833
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,720
- I don't like his dance.
- You don't like it?

834
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,950
- I don't like it.
- Okay.

835
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,990
- At all.
- Okay. Let's keep going.

836
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,570
- Play the next song.
- So Min, you're doing great.

837
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,730
(Play the next song.)

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,370
I like this song.

- Oh, man. This is...
- Gosh, this is so difficult.

841
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,550
- Gosh, this is so difficult.
- I can't believe she's dancing...

842
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,910
- this dance move to that song.
- What is this?

843
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,170
Hey, this is not the original dance.

844
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,590
(She doesn't know this song
for sure.)

845
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,860
Keep going!

846
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,560
(As the familiar chorus begins...)

847
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,800
(Jeon Sin Ae appears.)

848
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,920
(The whistle is blown.)

849
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,160
- So Min danced as she wanted.
- But it doesn't matter...

850
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,460
as long as Yoo Jin likes it.
Am I wrong?

851
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,460
She just let herself go.

852
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,430
- You did great, So Min. I love you.
- My goodness.

853
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,580
- Then who is it?
- See? It's okay if she likes it.

854
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,400
- Who's eliminated?
- Who's out?

855
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,110
Who's eliminated?
I just wanted to say I liked it.

856
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,380
But she danced as she pleased.

857
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,970
So Min danced a different dance.

858
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,380
- I liked her dance.
- She didn't copy it. Is that okay?

859
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,440
- It's my style.
- Right? I knew it.

860
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,940
- Okay.
- Her dance is a good example.

861
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,250
- LEESEO, you're a great dancer,
- Yes?

862
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,950
but can you do a dance
that suits the songs they play?

863
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,560
- She really is an expert.
- Right. She's an expert.

864
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,830
- Okay.
- But it was a girl group dance.

865
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,450
- So I can just dance as I want?
- Yes.

866
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,450
As long as Yoo Jin likes it.

867
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,960
- Oh, as long as she likes it?
- Yes, as long as I like it.

868
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,260
She altered the game.

869
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,200
- Let's go!
- What is she doing?

870
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,970
(This time, they played a song
that LEESEO would know.)

871
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,780
On, no. It's hard.

872
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,050
(Jae Suk doesn't know what to do.)

873
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,950
- Why?
- Jae Suk, you failed.

874
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,180
Gosh, seriously.

875
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,250
How did he dance?

876
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,420
- You're out.
- I want to know.

877
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,950
- I'm so curious.
- Come here.

878
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,690
- Hey, Yoo Jin.
- How did he dance?

879
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,720
- You didn't do it right.
- I did this move properly.

880
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,800
- I'm so curious.
- But...

881
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,900
He has pride in his dancing skills.

882
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,930
- What are your standards?
- Gosh, seriously.

883
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,160
- He looked like a locust.
- He's cute.

884
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,460
A locust?

885
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,730
That's because I'm dressed in green.

886
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,900
Can you do it just one more time?

887
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,170
- Sorry?
- Can you do it just one more time?

888
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,170
- Why should I...
- How did you dance?

889
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,810
- Just one more time.
- I'm curious.

890
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,850
Oh, my. He's doing well.
I think he's doing it right.

891
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,410
He's trying hard to do it well.

892
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,790
(He's trying hard.)

893
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,460
- I see why he got eliminated.
- Jae Suk, you failed.

894
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,990
You're still out.

895
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,900
- Gosh. I can't believe this.
- He failed.

896
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,430
- Yoo Jin is so picky.
- This is the final round.

897
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,110
- Is it over when one of us is out?
- I really want to join this team.

898
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,280
- I want to join their team too.
- Me too.

899
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,280
- I want to join this team.
- You've got this.

900
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,940
- I mean it. I have a strong desire.
- I want to join their team too.

901
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,170
- I have no idea what Yoo Jin likes.
- This team doesn't suit me.

902
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,970
(The last song is played.)

903
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,950
Hey.

904
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,560
(Excited)

905
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,160
- What are you guys doing?
- LEESEO is dancing alone here.

906
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,460
- Hey.
- Guys, look at LEESEO.

907
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,800
- We have no choice.
- Hey...

908
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,430
(Frightened)

909
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,570
What are you doing?

910
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,000
The game has changed.

911
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,430
- Why are they all here?
- My goodness.

912
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,430
- Why?
- Why?

913
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,670
- Hey, LEESEO danced alone.
- Right.

914
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,580
- Hey, why...
- Unfortunately,

915
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,900
Haha is out.

916
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,780
- So Min.
- Oh, they're joining this team?

917
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,880
Are you serious?

918
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,010
As a result, the four of them
are on the same team.

919
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,850
- You three have to play the game.
- This is driving me nuts.

920
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,710
We made it! We pulled it off!

921
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,560
- Only two of us will survive?
- Yes.

922
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,360
- So one of us will be alone.
- What happens to him?

923
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,800
- Will he be the weak link?
- Senior Ga Eul and LIZ, right?

924
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,690
- Yes.
- Senior Ga Eul and LIZ.

925
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,070
This is the final...

926
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,760
- I really want to join this team.
- Senior Ga Eul.

927
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,260
- Let's do this!
- I wanted to join this team before.

928
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,200
- I wanted that from the get-go.
- Let's go.

929
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,070
- They're trying to be chosen.
- This is our last chance.

930
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,470
- Senior Ga Eul...
- Let's do a chant.

931
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,700
- One, two, three. We've got this!
- One, two, three. We've got this!

932
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,580
- This is our last chance.
- Senior Ga Eul is my favorite.

933
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,670
- If you fail to join this team...
- You'll be an outcast if you lose.

934
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,080
- There's no other team to join.
- We must join this team.

935
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,940
- Senior Ga Eul, I respect you.
- Let's do this.

936
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,150
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go. LEESEO.

937
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,290
- Let's go, Senior Ga Eul.
- Oh, she's Ga Eul.

938
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,060
(This is the final game
to decide the outcast.)

939
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,800
- Ddu-du
- Ddu-du

940
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,340
(Singing awkwardly)

941
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,370
(Middle-aged men in the neighborhood
gathered to dance.)

942
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,900
- Ddu-du
- Ddu-du

943
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,080
(The whistle is blown.)

944
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,000
- Well... Haha...
- Oh, my gosh.

945
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,080
- His face...
- His face? My gosh.

946
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,080
- That's hip.
- She didn't like his face.

947
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,850
- All right. I guess...
- He's pouting.

948
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,010
- he's out.
- LIZ.

949
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,120
I...

950
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,950
(Who will be left alone?)

951
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,330
choose Jae Suk and Suk Jin...

952
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,990
(She chose Suk Jin and Jae Suk.)

953
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,830
- as our team members.
- Haha failed.

954
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,330
- Haha is out.
- Haha is out.

955
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

956
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,030
- Okay. Let's go!
- Okay. Let's go.

957
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,070
- Haha...
- Let's win!

958
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,840
- He's aged.
- He's old now.

959
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,730
- Mister!
- I feel bad for him.

960
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,730
- Haha is left alone.
- Poor Haha.

961
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,900
Why me?

962
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,310
(Why me?)

963
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,380
- Poor Haha.
- We don't want him.

964
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,580
- We won't accept that old man.
- Oh, no.

965
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,880
- It was a dance competition.
- Exactly.

966
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,210
(He lost in the dance competition.)

967
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,820
- Let's bring him into our team.
- Okay.

968
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,360
- Come here.
- Haha.

969
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,820
- Okay. Join that team.
- Haha, come here.

970
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,480
- Join our team.
- Go and join that team.

971
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,830
- Okay!
- He's on Yoo Jin's team.

972
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,490
This team has five members.

973
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,800
After you change your clothes,
we'll move to another location...

974
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,760
- I'm out of breath.
- to begin the first mission.

975
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,070
(Since Seok Sam risked his life
and fought hard to the end...)

976
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,230
Suk Jin is having chest pain.

977
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,370
I'm out of breath.

978
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,160
- He danced for too long.
- That's hilarious.

979
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,460
(Team Won Young and Rei:
Jong Kook, Se Chan)

980
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,670
(Team Yoo Jin and LEESEO:
Ji Hyo, So Min, Haha)

981
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,110
(Team Ga Eul and LIZ:
Suk Jin, Jae Suk)

982
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,050
L to the O and there's more

983
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,510
- Yoo Jin, sit with your team.
- Okay.

984
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,780
Yoo Jin, what are you wearing?
Is it that cold?

985
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,550
- It's warm today.
- Here?

986
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,160
- Hey, Rei.
- This is LEESEO's seat.

987
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,930
Ga Eul, you sit here.

988
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,950
- She looks cute, right?
- Indeed. She looks so cute.

989
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,300
(She spotted the camera
that was filming her.)

990
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,800
I see that you pose like that
automatically in front of a camera.

991
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:45,130
- We're not good at that.
- She found the camera right away.

992
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,430
Suk Jin would do it
if he gets paid for it.

993
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,050
- He'd do anything if he gets paid.
- As soon as I get paid.

994
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,470
The moment the money is wired,
he'd start striking cute poses.

995
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,110
Suk Jin is grateful for attention,
but money makes him happier.

996
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,380
- Money is important.
- Right.

997
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,820
He'd do whatever he's asked
as soon as he's paid.

998
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,360
- The bus is fully packed today.
- Here you go.

999
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,660
Put on your seat belt.

1000
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,990
- It looks like a bear.
- That's right.

1001
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,280
Thank you.

1002
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,990
- Won Young, did you put yours on?
- Yes, I put on my seat belt.

1003
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,530
- "Really."
- Is that the right expression?

1004
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,630
- Your seats are switched.
- She's from Nagoya?

1005
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,630
But it doesn't matter.

1006
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,930
- It's okay.
- It doesn't matter.

1007
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,630
By the way, the bus is fully packed.

1008
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,910
- Exactly.
- It's nice.

1009
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,260
- It hasn't happened in a while.
- It's so crowded.

1010
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,510
- It's like a school trip, right?
- Yes.

1011
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,780
- Hey, you'd be the principal.
- Teacher.

1012
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,970
- Don't act like you're their age.
- Teacher.

1013
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,010
- If this were a school trip,
- Do they still go on a school trip?

1014
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,450
- Haha would be a teacher.
- I'm sure they do.

1015
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,470
- He'd be a teacher.
- A PE teacher. No, wait.

1016
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,240
- A principal.
- He'd be a chemistry teacher.

1017
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,450
- A chemistry teacher?
- I think it suits you.

1018
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,660
I bet
he knows nothing about chemistry.

1019
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,050
- By the way, So Min.
- Yes?

1020
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,360
There's nothing you can teach kids.
What kind of teacher would you be?

1021
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,030
- Me? What do you mean?
- Sorry?

1022
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,490
I would teach them about love.

1023
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,760
(I would teach them about love.)

1024
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,200
- You're really something, So Min.
- They're too young to love.

1025
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,030
- She's really something.
- They're not too young to love.

1026
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,630
- I'd teach them how to love.
- They're too young to love.

1027
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,530
Nonsense. Ga Eul here is 22.

1028
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,970
- Ga Eul, are you 22?
- Yes.

1029
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,510
- Were you born in 2002?
- Yes.

1030
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,970
- I'm a World Cup baby.
- You're a World Cup baby?

1031
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,280
You couldn't watch
the 2002 World Cup, right?

1032
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,570
(You couldn't watch
the 2002 World Cup, right?)

1033
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,650
The 2002 World Cup.

1034
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,320
I didn't know she was born
in the year of the World Cup.

1035
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,550
- You heard that many times, right?
- Yes.

1036
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,090
- She's a World Cup baby.
- I'm LEESEO's guardian.

1037
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,410
- I don't know why, but...
- LEESEO was born in 2007, right?

1038
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,320
- Yes, correct.
- Oh, my. She was born in 2007.

1039
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,050
- That means we're quite old, right?
- Exactly.

1040
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,160
- I'll tell you the rules in here.
- Really?

1041
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,400
The race hasn't begun yet?

1042
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,490
- When will we begin the race?
- The race has begun.

1043
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,660
Today's race we're having...

1044
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,530
with the IVE members
who are as cute as rabbits are...

1045
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,240
- Yes.
- Rabbit with No Liver.

1046
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,130
- Rabbit with No Liver?
- A rabbit has no liver?

1047
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,840
- No liver?
- That's not good.

1048
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,110
- I thought she said "no sense."
- I'll give you these first.

1049
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,450
- No liver?
- Oh, I see.

1050
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,410
- You mean, like in the folktale?
- What's that?

1051
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,650
This year is the Year of the Rabbit.
Each team gets a different type.

1052
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,110
- These are for Jong Kook's team.
- It's cute.

1053
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,160
- These are for my team?
- It's cute.

1054
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,090
- Oh, rabbit ears.
- It's cute.

1055
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,320
- Oh, my. Look at this.
- It's cute.

1056
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,950
- All idol singers...
- Thank you.

1057
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,630
- say it out loud always.
- I like it.

1058
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,160
- When they see something cute,
- It's cute.

1059
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,400
- they say, "It's cute."
- It's cute.

1060
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,090
- "Right?"
- "Right?"

1061
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,240
Rei.

1062
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,910
As you can see,

1063
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,800
- there are 13 rabbits here.
- Continue.

1064
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,780
But among the normal rabbits,

1065
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,700
- a Rabbit with No Liver is hiding.
- Of course.

1066
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,150
- Who is that?
- Of course, there's a twist.

1067
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,910
(1 of them is a spy.)

1068
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,240
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

1069
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,510
- What's going on?
- Really?

1070
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,320
- Does the spy know that?
- Is it you, Won Young?

1071
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,660
Yes, the spy knows who he or she is.

1072
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,880
One of you is
the Rabbit with No Liver.

1073
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,220
You'll guess who's the rabbit
with no liver at the end.

1074
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,900
- If you're right, you get a prize.
- It'll be hard to figure out.

1075
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,430
- Only one of us all?
- Then...

1076
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,590
- You have no liver, right?
- Only one...

1077
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,160
- You're the spy, right?
- Just one of us?

1078
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,470
- Me?
- Is the Rabbit with No Liver...

1079
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,800
- I'm not... No.
- already decided?

1080
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,470
(I'm not... No.)

1081
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,700
- She's suspicious.
- Why? You mean, LEESEO?

1082
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,550
- I asked if she was the spy.
- There's one among us.

1083
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,070
And she got so flustered.

1084
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,650
- Aren't you the spy?
- No, I'm not.

1085
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,340
- She stuttered.
- Pretending he didn't hear me.

1086
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,090
- We must find the spy by any means.
- Of course.

1087
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,660
- Yoo Jin seems suspicious.
- That's awesome.

1088
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,530
- We must find the spy by any means.
- Of course.

1089
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,490
(Why is she smiling?)

1090
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,950
- Jae Suk.
- Yoo Jin seems suspicious.

1091
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,360
- Yoo Jin could make a good spy.
- I'm not the spy.

1092
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,660
- Oh, it must be Yoo Jin. It's you.
- It's highly likely she's the spy.

1093
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,930
- I'm not the spy.
- Okay. Yoo Jin is the spy.

1094
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,160
- It's Yoo Jin.
- That's very likely, right?

1095
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,360
- Yes, it's very likely.
- I agree.

1096
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,260
- It could be LIZ.
- If it's one of us, it's too easy.

1097
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,800
- Right. We can just tell.
- How about Rei?

1098
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,700
I think they chose the leader.

1099
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,410
- Me?
- Since Yoo Jin...

1100
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,110
has been on many variety shows,

1101
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,680
- she would do a great job. Hey.
- Suddenly...

1102
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,180
- No, I'm not the spy.
- So Min seems suspicious too.

1103
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,650
- I would've been an obvious choice.
- Right.

1104
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,410
- I think...
- Won Young, why are you so quiet?

1105
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,110
No, it's not like that.

1106
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,490
- She's pretending she's the spy.
- She's suspicious.

1107
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,430
- We're all bad at lying.
- Really?

1108
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,360
- That's true.
- Yes, it's true.

1109
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,470
- It shows when we play a game.
- We can't fool one another.

1110
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,470
But Ga Eul, you know what?
Before we joined Running Man,

1111
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,160
- we used to be bad at lying too.
- Of course.

1112
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,240
- This show made us like this.
- We improved gradually.

1113
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,470
So Min.

1114
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,110
How did you feel
when you heard you were the spy?

1115
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,050
Jong Kook,
I'm too timid to be a spy.

1116
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,200
Her reaction is strange, right?

1117
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,610
- No, I'm too timid.
- She never reacts like that.

1118
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,950
- I do have a liver.
- She said she was too timid.

1119
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,220
- Haha, you've been acting weird.
- It could be her.

1120
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,610
- Oh, come to think of it,
- You're suspicious too.

1121
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,010
- he was left alone earlier.
- No, I'm not the spy.

1122
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,490
Jae Suk.

1123
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,760
You seem suspicious since you're
asking so many questions.

1124
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,990
- Right. That's how you find a spy.
- Won Young.

1125
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,030
- That's why you seem...
- I always ask a lot of questions.

1126
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,400
- to be at an advantage.
- I agree.

1127
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,240
And he looks most similar
to a rabbit among all of us.

1128
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,070
- He looks like a rabbit.
- That's true.

1129
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,260
- Rabbits are pretty. Take it back.
- Haha is right.

1130
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,570
- He's cute.
- There are various rabbit breeds.

1131
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,470
- Some rabbits have crooked teeth.
- Rabbits are so lovely.

1132
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,550
- So you have no liver?
- Some have crooked front teeth.

1133
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,910
- You're so suspicious.
- No way.

1134
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

1135
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

1136
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,320
I feel like...

1137
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,360
- I'm in Thailand.
- Exactly.

1138
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,860
- People wait in line to eat here.
- It's interesting.

1139
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,900
- I feel like I'm in Thailand.
- Is this a popular restaurant?

1140
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,700
- Hello.
- One, two, three, four, five...

1141
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,490
Thank you!

1142
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,760
- Thank you.
- Hello.

1143
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,570
I'm hungry. I'm glad we're here.

1144
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,360
I must say, this place is...

1145
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,970
I guess
I haven't dined out in a long while.

1146
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,510
This place is... I mean...

1147
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,050
I know this place
because my wife likes it.

1148
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,840
- Oh, I see.
- This is her favorite restaurant.

1149
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,050
- I'm so excited.
- Before the shoot,

1150
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,680
we asked the IVE members
about the restaurants...

1151
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,910
- where they're regulars.
- Really?

1152
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,320
- Yoo Jin recommended this place.
- Oh, I see.

1153
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,380
- We all like this restaurant.
- Oh, Yoo Jin knew this restaurant.

1154
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,360
- Yoo Jin, are you a regular here?
- I like this place too.

1155
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,800
Yes, I eat here often.

1156
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,320
I wait in line for an hour
to eat here.

1157
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,240
- You have to wait in line? Really?
- Yes.

1158
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,260
- You will play a game first.
- Okay.

1159
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,410
The IVE members said they wanted to
play this game in the pre-interview.

1160
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,840
- It's a debate game.
- A debate?

1161
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,780
- A debate?
- We're good at it.

1162
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,590
- Hold Your Breath And Debate Dive.
- Okay.

1163
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,090
You will freely debate
on a given topic...

1164
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,760
and make your choice individually.

1165
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,430
What more staff members choose
will be the correct answer.

1166
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,260
Those of you who choose
the same answer...

1167
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,050
- will get one point.
- Okay. That's great.

1168
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,090
The team with the highest score...

1169
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,660
- will get a hint about the spy.
- Nice.

1170
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,700
- The spy should try hard, right?
- Of course.

1171
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,910
- Not to get caught.
- The spy should stand firm, right?

1172
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,240
- I don't think I can do that.
- That's right.

1173
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,570
The spy should be active.

1174
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,180
Won Young, are you good at arguing?

1175
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,380
I think I can argue logically.

1176
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,720
Really? Okay. That's good.
It's important in this game.

1177
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,950
- Here goes your first topic.
- Yes.

1178
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,550
(What's the definition
of a dog's upper and lower bodies?)

1179
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,050
- A dog?
- What's this?

1180
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,780
- Oh, boy.
- What's that?

1181
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,950
- What part is the upper body?
- I know what it means.

1182
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,490
- Those who have a pet dog...
- It's obvious.

1183
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,720
- would choose A.
- The answer is...

1184
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,030
- Obviously, the answer is...
- It's A.

1185
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,990
- It's definitely A.
- This is too obvious.

1186
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,570
- A is the correct answer.
- There's nothing to talk about.

1187
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,970
- We'll all choose the same answer.
- It's B.

1188
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,240
- No, it's A!
- It's A.

1189
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,610
- It's B.
- I expected no one to choose B.

1190
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,470
- A is the correct answer.
- It's A.

1191
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,630
- Of course, it's A. It's too easy.
- No, B is right.

1192
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,680
The part where its legs are
should be the lower body.

1193
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,780
You should consider
the forelimbs its arms.

1194
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,490
But if you think about it,

1195
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,180
those are all considered as legs.

1196
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,760
- They're front and hind legs.
- That's right.

1197
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,450
Let's hear what each of us thinks.

1198
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,680
What do you think, LIZ?

1199
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,400
- When you put clothes on a dog,
- Yes.

1200
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,820
it usually covers the front part
from the neck.

1201
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,070
So I think the part that's covered
is the upper body.

1202
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,470
- She's right.
- When you dress a dog,

1203
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,260
the clothes cover the top...

1204
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,300
- Also...
- The belly faces down,

1205
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,430
and there's the back.

1206
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,340
- What did you say?
- What do you mean by that?

1207
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,780
- What I'm saying is...
- Yes.

1208
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,010
When you dress a dog,
you put clothes on its back.

1209
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,950
Does it only cover its back?

1210
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,650
Yes. It doesn't cover the belly.

1211
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,410
- That's because they have to pee.
- It doesn't cover the belly.

1212
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,160
- But if you look at B,
- Yes.

1213
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,930
the upper body includes...

1214
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,660
- the butt and the tail.
- That's right.

1215
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,530
That means the tail is a part
of the upper body.

1216
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,570
That's a good point.

1217
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,740
I'm not sure if it's okay to say this,
but the anus...

1218
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,260
- The anus is in the upper body.
- should be in the lower body.

1219
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,970
- The anus...
- It should be in the lower body.

1220
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,380
The anus is in the lower body.

1221
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,280
- But the tail...
- Although the tail is included...

1222
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,680
- I know this because I have a dog.
- Do you think it's A or B?

1223
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,780
I think it's B.

1224
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,910
A is the correct answer.

1225
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,840
- No, B is correct.
- We have different opinions.

1226
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,820
I think A is the correct answer.

1227
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,820
- Why?
- Yoo Jin had a dog too.

1228
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,950
It's because...

1229
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,660
when you train a dog to give its paw,
you say "hand."

1230
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,320
- That's right.
- Exactly!

1231
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,860
- When you train a dog?
- True.

1232
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,320
Then the dog puts
one of its front paws on your hand.

1233
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,030
- That's right.
- Therefore,

1234
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,970
we should consider
the front paws as the hands...

1235
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,570
and front legs as the arms.

1236
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,570
The part with the arms...

1237
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,860
- That's easy to understand.
- is the upper body.

1238
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,430
- Thus, the answer is A.
- I agree.

1239
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,910
- If B is the correct answer,
- Yoo Jin has a pet dog.

1240
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,280
- a dog would give all four paws.
- Exactly.

1241
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,380
- Listen to me.
- Then...

1242
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,570
- A dog can be trained differently.
- But that's how we train dogs.

1243
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:14,340
You can train a dog
to give a hind paw...

1244
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,410
- when you say, "Give me your hand."
- She's right.

1245
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,720
- Dogs can be trained to do so.
- So you think it's B?

1246
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,360
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I believe B is the correct answer.

1247
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,630
- If compared to a human body...
- Yes.

1248
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,430
- The pelvis is in the lower body.
- Of course.

1249
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,300
- You said to compare it to us...
- Yes.

1250
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,800
- Right.
- But that's a dog in the picture.

1251
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,630
- It's a dog.
- It's a dog.

1252
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,930
- So?
- For the dog, they're all paws.

1253
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,570
- Right. They don't have hands.
- They don't have hands.

1254
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,470
- They don't have hands,
- They...

1255
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:41,740
- They walk with paws.
- but...

1256
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,680
- I think it makes sense.
- Right?

1257
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,720
- Think that it's a horse.
- Right?

1258
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,010
We call it a front leg.
We don't call it hand.

1259
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,010
- Of course.
- Of course.

1260
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,320
- Of course.
- We don't call it hand.

1261
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,280
- We're humans. But that's a dog.
- Tell them.

1262
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,180
- Right.
- We should understand them first.

1263
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,630
- Yes.
- That's right.

1264
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,490
- So what do you say?
- That's very good.

1265
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,930
- I choose B.
- B.

1266
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,400
- LEESEO, you tell us.
- It's B.

1267
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,660
I'll choose A
because Yoo Jin thinks it's A.

1268
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,300
- Say your opinion.
- That's great.

1269
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,630
- I mean...
- Look.

1270
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,300
- Why would you...
- Why did you follow...

1271
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,800
- Yoo Jin's opinion?
- Tell us your opinion.

1272
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,010
- Why did you follow her opinion?
- I...

1273
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,410
LEESEO.

1274
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,720
Humans used to walk on all fours
before evolving.

1275
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,510
- And...
- Yes. Go ahead.

1276
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,110
- Walking upright...
- Won Young is talking.

1277
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,760
- Won Young is talking.
- Won Young is talking.

1278
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,950
I'm talking too.

1279
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,720
Won Young is talking.

1280
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,930
- Won Young, tell us.
- What's your opinion?

1281
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,570
And look. Fundamentally, we call it
the upper body and the lower body.

1282
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,970
- "Up" and "low."
- Yes.

1283
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:42,510
- Dogs basically stand like this.
- That's true.

1284
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,530
Then isn't this their upper body
and this the lower body?

1285
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,530
Exactly.

1286
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,380
- That's right.
- If you look it like this,

1287
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,570
- But Won Young.
- that's left and right.

1288
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,910
- So it's A, isn't it?
- If it's A, it's left and right.

1289
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,970
- So it's B.
- This is frustrating.

1290
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:57,050
- If it's A, it's left and right.
- Let's say you took a dog to a vet.

1291
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,860
If you say you want to get
the upper body X-ray done,

1292
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,450
- Okay.
- then which part will they X-ray?

1293
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,280
- This part?
- Right.

1294
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,950
- They will X-ray this part.
- That makes sense.

1295
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,720
- That makes sense.
- Why would you X-ray it?

1296
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,720
- I'm going back to A.
- Great.

1297
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,340
- If you go to a vet...
- Have you taken a dog to a vet?

1298
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,760
I've never done it.

1299
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,030
- But people know...
- You were lying then.

1300
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,110
- from experience.
- You stay still.

1301
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,700
You know when you go to a vet...

1302
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,300
and tell them their upper body
is bad,

1303
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,570
do you think
they will check that part?

1304
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:26,780
- It'd be that part.
- But which part is the upper one?

1305
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,590
- This is the upper part.
- Which is "up" in the picture?

1306
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,510
- In the picture.
- It's B.

1307
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,110
- No.
- A is...

1308
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:36,320
- Won Young is good.
- A is left and right.

1309
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,550
It's B.

1310
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,950
- Look.
- That was nice, Won Young.

1311
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,860
It's confusing because the picture
is put horizontally.

1312
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,430
- It's not A.
- Look at this.

1313
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,660
No, that's...

1314
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,860
- It's more comfortable to look at.
- This is not how dogs stand.

1315
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,340
- No. Why would you do that?
- Look at this.

1316
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,660
- Do dogs live like this?
- Look at it this way.

1317
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,840
- Do dogs live like this?
- That's what I'm talking about.

1318
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,030
- They live like this.
- What do you know?

1319
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,240
- "What do you know?"
- Hey, and...

1320
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,240
Think that it's cut like this.
It's an awful thing to do to a dog.

1321
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,340
- I mean the legs...
- I feel so bad.

1322
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,410
Is it not awful
if it's cut vertically?

1323
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,410
- It's awful.
- Is it not awful...

1324
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:03,410
if it's cut like this?

1325
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,680
- Are you that cruel, Won Young?
- Tell us.

1326
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,680
If you go to a pet shop
and ask for pants for a dog,

1327
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,680
how do they look?

1328
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,700
Have you seen pants that cover
the dog like this?

1329
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,700
The pants...

1330
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,660
You don't put pants
on the lower part only.

1331
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,700
We get pants that cover this part.

1332
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,660
- We get pants that cover this part.
- It's A.

1333
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,130
- It's A, right?
- It's A.

1334
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,200
- How many times are you changing?
- You get pants like this.

1335
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,530
Think about it.
Do you get pants like this?

1336
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,530
- Suk Jin.
- Why?

1337
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,180
Have you bought pants for a dog?

1338
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,650
Not even once.

1339
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,110
- No, right?
- You don't buy them like that.

1340
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,110
He's talking
about something he doesn't know.

1341
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:33,820
- No dog pants...
- I know from my life experience.

1342
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,650
- look like that.
- It's like a onesie.

1343
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:40,950
- Ji Hyo raised many dogs.
- I know. She loves dogs.

1344
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,660
- But Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

1345
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,320
Look at this.
Anyway, they sell pants like this.

1346
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,070
- Not this.
- They don't sell those.

1347
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,820
No.

1348
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,970
- The diaper.
- That's not true.

1349
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,660
- Do they sell pants like that?
- You put all their legs into holes.

1350
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,630
- Then you zip it up.
- That's...

1351
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,840
(Four legs?)

1352
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,410
- That's for a walk.
- Hey.

1353
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:04,240
What about dog shoes?

1354
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,070
- We buy four.
- They give you four.

1355
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:09,090
- We put them on all fours.
- We don't ask for gloves and shoes.

1356
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,320
- Right?
- Yes.

1357
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,880
We call it four shoes.

1358
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,880
- It's four shoes.
- No.

1359
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,430
It's B.

1360
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,860
- Right.
- It's B.

1361
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,220
- Do you know what's important here?
- We've never heard of dog gloves.

1362
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,220
- No. I think it's A.
- It's about if it's the upper...

1363
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,220
or the lower body.

1364
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,660
This is about separating
the upper and lower body.

1365
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,840
It's not about if they have
4 feet or 2 hands.

1366
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,530
Then it means feet
can be attached to the upper body.

1367
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,970
- Sorry?
- Feet can be attached...

1368
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,200
to the upper body?

1369
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,410
- Yes. To the upper body.
- Feet are attached...

1370
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,740
to the upper body?

1371
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,050
But... Okay. Go ahead.

1372
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,510
Hey. It's A.

1373
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,880
- It's A.
- It's A.

1374
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,320
- It's A.
- The nipples.

1375
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,320
Nipples can't be attached
on the lower body.

1376
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,450
Hey. Someone got nipples
on their lower body.

1377
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,450
Who?

1378
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,160
- Who?
- Over there.

1379
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,660
- Nipples...
- It's B.

1380
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,070
- It's B.
- Nipples...

1381
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,090
(He got it at once.)

1382
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,340
Right. It's B.

1383
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,700
- No.
- He got nipples on his lower body.

1384
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:05,070
That's not true.

1385
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,610
That's not true.

1386
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,840
- I want to know the answer quickly.
- Yoo Jin, speak one more time.

1387
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,050
- I want to be persuaded.
- Shall we vote?

1388
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:16,090
- We chose B. But we can pick A.
- Should we go for B?

1389
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,510
Let's go with A.

1390
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,950
- It's A.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1391
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:24,630
- A.
- It's A.

1392
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,050
- They picked A.
- Everyone picked A.

1393
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,990
- Did they pick A?
- We followed the popular opinion.

1394
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,630
- Hold on.
- Only Ji Hyo...

1395
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:31,630
- chose B.
- Only Ji Hyo picked B.

1396
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,200
It's B for me.

1397
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,410
She's stubborn.

1398
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,630
- Hand. Leg.
- The staff members will vote too.

1399
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,910
- Please.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1400
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,340
Hand.

1401
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,610
- A.
- A.

1402
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:46,840
- What?
- One of them picked B.

1403
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,950
One of them picked B.
One of us picked B too.

1404
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,990
Everyone receives a point except
Ji Hyo as A received more votes.

1405
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,220
- A.
- Ji Hyo.

1406
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,320
This is how you do it.

1407
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,220
This is the second theme.

1408
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,630
Is human nature fundamentally
good or evil?

1409
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:03,760
This is hard.

1410
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,430
- We're going to argue a lot.
- This is hard.

1411
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,090
- We'll argue a lot.
- It's definitely evil.

1412
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,800
It's neither good nor evil.

1413
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,930
I've raised a child.

1414
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,110
- I'm neutral.
- You know?

1415
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:16,240
- I think it's good.
- I thought it was good.

1416
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,410
- You think it's good?
- A.

1417
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,470
- I think it's A too.
- A.

1418
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:22,590
- That's...
- Everyone is born with good nature.

1419
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:26,050
- Right. The society.
- The environment and the society...

1420
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,450
- can affect it.
- All babies seem to be good.

1421
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:31,550
- I was such a docile baby.
- Okay.

1422
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:35,090
But the society
changed me a little...

1423
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,700
- as I grew up.
- How did you change?

1424
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,820
- How did you change?
- How did you change?

1425
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,490
- I'm a little evil now.
- Really?

1426
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:41,760
- Yes. I think human nature is good.
- And you used to be nice?

1427
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,130
- Yes. I used to be nice.
- That happens.

1428
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,260
But the society
and my surroundings...

1429
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,470
- changed me.
- So human nature is good...

1430
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:47,680
- based on your experience.
- Yes.

1431
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,550
Some evil ones change
and become good people too.

1432
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:53,910
For Haha, before he got married,

1433
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,340
- he did so many evil things.
- It's not related to the topic.

1434
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,950
After he got married,
he completely changed.

1435
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,530
Is Haha's nature good or evil?

1436
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,550
(The theory that Haha was reformed
after he got married)

1437
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:08,300
People can change.
I started believing it,

1438
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,990
watching Haha.

1439
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,800
You can completely change.

1440
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,490
How about you, Rei?

1441
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,510
Rei.

1442
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:16,570
Yes?

1443
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,860
Do you know what it means?

1444
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,800
- Yes. I learned it.
- She heard the explanation.

1445
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:25,150
I also thought everyone
was born as good person.

1446
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,950
You thought human nature
was fundamentally good.

1447
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:31,490
But everyone is a little evil.

1448
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,410
But by watching how others behave,
they learn...

1449
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,680
- They can become better people.
- to be a better person.

1450
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,260
So you think human nature
is fundamentally evil.

1451
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,050
- Yes. I think that's right.
- It's evil.

1452
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,630
- It's evil.
- Yes.

1453
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:45,900
At school, we learn ethics.

1454
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,430
- We learn what's good.
- People learn.

1455
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,430
And they realize it.

1456
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,070
But people do bad things
even without being taught.

1457
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:52,570
- They already know it.
- Right.

1458
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:54,910
- That's...
- So people are born evil.

1459
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:56,280
- That's right.
- Because...

1460
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,510
- if you give a bug to children,
- Yes.

1461
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,820
- they don't feel guilty.
- Right.

1462
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:00,820
It doesn't mean they're evil.

1463
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,320
- Yes.
- They just destroy it.

1464
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,320
- Right.
- They don't know then.

1465
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,150
- I used to destroy many things.
- They do it without knowing.

1466
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,220
- They naturally destroy things.
- Right.

1467
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,720
- No, that's not true.
- I know.

1468
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,660
- It's their instinct.
- Some children...

1469
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,860
treat even a flower or a bug
with kindness.

1470
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,530
- Of course, everyone is different.
- People are basically evil.

1471
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,470
Even if they're young...
When there are two babies,

1472
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,410
if you take care
of just one of them,

1473
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,510
the other one gets jealous
and cries and whines.

1474
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,110
- Right.
- Yes.

1475
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:30,840
Jealousy is a negative feeling.
So human nature is more like evil.

1476
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,180
- That's right.
- Yes.

1477
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,820
- She's smart.
- Yes!

1478
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,180
- Yes!
- She's doing good.

1479
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,720
Guys, think about this.

1480
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,780
People learn very quickly
when they are young.

1481
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,780
Yes.

1482
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,160
- They learn from others.
- They might've learned to be evil.

1483
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,970
Are you saying that people know...

1484
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:51,660
how to hit others as soon
as they're born? It's not like that.

1485
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,090
- I know.
- They learn from others.

1486
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:58,260
- This is why humans...
- That's why human nature is evil.

1487
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,010
- learn from people around them.
- Okay.

1488
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,180
That's why human nature is good.

1489
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,970
It's because they learned to do so.

1490
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,820
Right.
They might've learned to be evil.

1491
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:11,220
The moment a baby is born,
do they smile?

1492
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,680
- Right. They cry.
- Or do they frown?

1493
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,950
- They frown and cry.
- They frown.

1494
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,860
- Come on.
- They cry when they're born.

1495
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:20,530
- We wish we were born good.
- It would've been nice.

1496
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,530
- But we were not. We can't help it.
- We want to believe...

1497
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,860
that our nature is good.

1498
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,530
But I'm saying human nature
is more evil than good.

1499
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:28,430
- Anyway,
- Let's vote.

1500
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:29,660
it's A or B.

1501
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,610
- B is evil.
- A is good.

1502
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:34,610
- A is good and B is evil.
- B is evil. Okay.

1503
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,300
- One.
- It would be half and half.

1504
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,240
- No. I don't know.
- When people are born...

1505
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,780
Guys, let me say the last word.

1506
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,340
Everyone is good.

1507
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,110
- Everyone is evil.
- Everyone is good.

1508
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:49,430
Don't consider them evil because
of their instinctive behaviors.

1509
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,130
- Everyone is evil.
- Everyone is good.

1510
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,430
- They cry when they're born.
- Right. They cry when they're born.

1511
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:55,220
Everyone is restraining themselves.
You know it.

1512
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,930
- Put it up.
- Put it up on the count of three.

1513
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,240
In 1, 2, 3.

1514
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,470
Everyone is restraining themselves.

1515
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,990
In 1, 2, 3.

1516
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,010
Everyone is restraining themselves.

1517
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,570
- Human nature is evil.
- We're restraining our evil side.

1518
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:06,300
Am I the only one who picked A?

1519
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,070
- We're restraining ourselves.
- Yes. We're restraining ourselves.

1520
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:10,340
Only Jae Suk thinks
human nature is good.

1521
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,470
- Yes.
- The staff members will vote too.

1522
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,410
Everyone...

1523
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,610
- is born good.
- Don't listen to him.

1524
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,180
People cry when they're born.

1525
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,610
- No.
- For real.

1526
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:23,130
- In 1, 2, 3.
- I wish we were good.

1527
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,260
- What?
- A!

1528
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,860
- It's A!
- They chose A.

1529
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,530
- Two, three.
- I wish we were good.

1530
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,970
- What?
- A!

1531
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:30,400
- It's A!
- They chose A.

1532
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,470
- It's a miracle.
- No way.

1533
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,860
- It's a miracle.
- It's A.

1534
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,200
Jae Suk spoke too much.

1535
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,860
- What is this?
- Dear people.

1536
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,510
- Dear people.
- This is nonsense.

1537
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,510
You will be blessed.

1538
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:41,680
It's A.

1539
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,970
You will be blessed.

1540
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,340
- Did you choose Side A?
- Yes.

1541
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,050
(Hold on.)

1542
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,880
- Isn't he the Rabbit with No Liver?
- Did you choose Side A?

1543
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,010
- The Rabbit with No Liver.
- The Rabbit with No Liver.

1544
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,220
- He doesn't have a liver.
- The Rabbit with No Liver?

1545
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,590
- Isn't it him?
- He's the Rabbit with No Liver.

1546
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,030
- It was a mission.
- He did it on purpose.

1547
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:59,050
Everyone has to go
with what he chooses.

1548
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:03,820
- He chose something else.
- Right?

1549
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,530
That's right. I guess they have
to go with what he chooses.

1550
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,740
He's the Rabbit with No Liver.

1551
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,340
They were influenced by what I said.

1552
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,030
- No.
- No.

1553
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,510
- I persuaded them.
- That's not true.

1554
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:17,570
- It makes no sense.
- It doesn't.

1555
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,470
Let's ask someone.
Why did you come to that decision?

1556
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,610
Why did you think so?

1557
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:23,880
(He's flustered.)

1558
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,880
- Myung Sub, tell us.
- Tell us.

1559
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,660
- Tell us.
- Say it on behalf of the staff.

1560
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,380
- Hold on.
- Right.

1561
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,090
His child was born.

1562
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,490
- His child was recently born.
- He has a child.

1563
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:35,900
- He has a child.
- But...

1564
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,070
- It's only been a month.
- One month?

1565
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,240
Of course, you would think
the child is like an angel.

1566
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,300
- You wait.
- That's a cute phase.

1567
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,130
Wait until the child takes other's things
and starts crying.

1568
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,510
- This makes no sense.
- So,

1569
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,610
- the winner in this mission...
- No way.

1570
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,110
is this team.

1571
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,840
He won this?

1572
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,110
- It's our team. We won.
- Good.

1573
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:57,320
You can take this hint
about the Rabbit with No Liver.

1574
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,860
- Only the four of you can see it.
- We're the only ones who can check.

1575
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,450
He should win if he wants to keep
his identity hidden.

1576
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:04,450
- He has no liver.
- It's strange.

1577
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:07,430
- Keep it to yourselves.
- Okay.

1578
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,630
(Team Jae Suk received a hint
about the Rabbit with No Liver.)

1579
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:18,000
What does this mean?

1580
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,190
Okay.

1581
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,230
It's not clear-cut, right?

1582
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,460
(The hint is confusing?)

1583
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,670
Why are you reading it
until the last moment?

1584
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,570
- Have you understood it?
- Yes.

1585
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,130
Okay. Don't say anything.

1586
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:32,110
- They might figure it out.
- I think I get it.

1587
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:33,710
Jae Suk is acting strange.

1588
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,000
- Right?
- Yes. He's acting strange.

1589
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:38,980
This is really...

1590
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,170
- It's amazing.
- It's great.

1591
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,540
We have to watch closely
when they eat.

1592
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,840
- I almost misinterpreted it.
- Right?

1593
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,150
You have to be attentive
when they eat.

1594
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,630
You don't have a liver
or a gall-bladder.

1595
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,750
- He's suspicious.
- He's suspicious.

1596
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,460
- The food we prepared...
- Yes.

1597
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,320
is the signature menu of this place.

1598
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:00,170
It's Lang Zaab,
a Thai dish of steamed bones.

1599
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,360
What is that?

1600
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,310
It's Yoo Jin's pick. I should try it.

1601
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:08,310
And fried rice with crab meat...

1602
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,880
- seasoned with Thai soy sauce.
- I like that.

1603
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,420
It looks nice.

1604
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,880
That's amazing.

1605
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,290
Can we all eat it?

1606
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,520
- Enjoy it as much as you can.
- We love it.

1607
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,590
You can eat it.

1608
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,380
They'll just give it to us.

1609
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,860
I'm hungry.

1610
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,000
- They're making it.
- It must be delicious.

1611
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,250
I'm hungry.

1612
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,400
What is this?

1613
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,290
- That's Lang Zaab.
- It's Lang Zaab.

1614
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,170
- It looks nice.
- Is this steamed bones?

1615
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,900
What is this?

1616
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,900
This is crazy.

1617
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,400
- I've never seen this before.
- That looks amazing.

1618
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,500
- It looks great.
- It looks tasty.

1619
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,440
- Each team can eat together.
- Can we eat?

1620
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,750
You can start eating
when all the dishes are out.

1621
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,380
- Okay.
- Eat.

1622
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,460
- Is this spicy?
- I guess so.

1623
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,460
I think it will be a bit sour.

1624
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,560
It looks so good.

1625
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,520
I'll enjoy it so much.

1626
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,360
- It's pepper.
- How does it taste?

1627
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:03,130
- Is it not your taste?
- Try it.

1628
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:04,590
It tastes bland.

1629
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,040
- Is it?
- It's bland?

1630
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,310
It doesn't look bland.

1631
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:09,940
When are the rest coming?

1632
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,210
(Team Jae Suk observes them.)

1633
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,380
- Look.
- When are the rest coming?

1634
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,210
When are the rest coming?

1635
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,340
- Is it delicious, So Min?
- It's not what I imagined.

1636
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,820
I thought it will be sour,
but it's not.

1637
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,190
It's very spicy.

1638
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,250
- It's spicy?
- It's spicy.

1639
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,360
- There's a lot of chili pepper.
- What else does it taste like?

1640
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,980
- Can we taste it?
- Let's taste it.

1641
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,020
I think we should try it.
Don't start eating yet.

1642
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:36,570
They said something about eating
when they received the hint.

1643
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:39,360
- Something about eating.
- That's right.

1644
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,770
(Jae Suk told them
to observe when people eat.)

1645
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:45,380
(Detective Kim caught that.)

1646
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,130
Someone has to carry out a mission.

1647
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,380
Is the mission to eat first?

1648
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,670
What?

1649
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,320
Why did So Min eat just now?

1650
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,020
You've no liver.

1651
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:58,150
You ate when we were told
not to eat yet. You have no liver.

1652
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,110
She's the one with no liver.

1653
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,960
The dishes are all out.
You can enjoy your meal.

1654
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,060
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

1655
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,500
It's really delicious.

1656
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,040
Is this how you eat this, Yoo Jin?

1657
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,900
This is good.

1658
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,040
- It's delicious.
- It's tasty.

1659
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,340
- It's really good.
- It's delicious.

1660
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,270
This is tasty.

1661
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,270
(Everyone is enjoying the meal.)

1662
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:27,040
Hyung In...

1663
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,040
(Detective Kim is investigating
alone.)

1664
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,650
told us to eat together.
There's a reason for that.

1665
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:31,750
I'll eat the bones first.

1666
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,750
- I'll eat the bones first.
- Jong Kook...

1667
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,730
- Jong Kook is standing.
- He's not eating.

1668
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,000
- Jong Kook.
- Eat, Jong Kook.

1669
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,460
Why aren't you eating?

1670
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,060
I am going to eat.

1671
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,960
- I should take one.
- Should I give you one?

1672
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,290
- Should we try this?
- Yes.

1673
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:46,170
I should eat it like this.

1674
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:47,460
It has a scent.

1675
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,730
(Will he be able to figure out
something this time?)

1676
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,340
It's so delicious.

1677
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,380
(Enjoying)

1678
00:58:55,750 --> 00:59:00,440
(They all forget about the rabbit
with no liver and enjoy the meal.)

1679
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,340
It's tasty.

1680
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:05,290
It's bland, isn't it?

1681
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,290
This is delicious.

1682
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:09,880
Is it just ours?

1683
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:11,730
This...

1684
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,320
It's not delicious.

1685
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,070
- Isn't it bland?
- Yes.

1686
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:19,770
Is the stew spicy?

1687
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,170
This is delicious.

1688
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:22,670
(Observing)

1689
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:24,170
This is really delicious.

1690
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:26,730
You can learn it.

1691
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,750
(But Haha in the same team
is enjoying the food.)

1692
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,540
It tastes authentic.

1693
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:32,880
It's nice.

1694
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,520
(Finishing)

1695
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,110
Jae Suk finished it.

1696
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,650
He's finished a plate.

1697
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,860
- It's clean.
- He works hard.

1698
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,860
Isn't it suspicious?

1699
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,960
- Our food is really delicious.
- Why?

1700
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm eating well
because it's very delicious.

1701
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,900
- Is it just ours?
- This...

1702
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,460
What's wrong?

1703
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,690
Does it taste different?

1704
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,840
I think the dishes taste different.

1705
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,130
I think they all taste different.

1706
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,210
- I think the tastes are different.
- Ours is very bland.

1707
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:04,520
- Yours is bland?
- Yes. A little bit.

1708
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:06,540
- What is this?
- I guess there's something.

1709
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,750
- What is it?
- Why?

1710
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,750
- Hold on.
- It's that bland?

1711
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:13,090
- Is yours all right?
- Salt is bad for your liver.

1712
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,820
What are you talking about?

1713
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,920
- Salt is bad for your liver.
- What does it taste like?

1714
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,230
It's not seasoned!

1715
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,860
- Ours is seasoned.
- It's not seasoned.

1716
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,170
- It's not seasoned.
- It's not seasoned.

1717
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,570
- Why?
- Ours is seasoned.

1718
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,070
- Whose dish?
- Look.

1719
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:30,070
(The rabbits with no hints
have found out something strange.)

1720
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:34,670
(The hint that Team Jae Suk got...)

1721
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:40,270
(The team with the rabbit with no
liver will eat unseasoned food.)

1722
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:43,750
I think this will taste better
with sauce.

1723
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,560
- It needs sauce.
- It's not finished.

1724
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:50,960
Could you give us some fish sauce
and some chili pepper?

1725
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:54,770
(The dish of all the teams
looks the same.)

1726
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:57,670
Could we get some soy sauce
and chili pepper?

1727
01:00:58,770 --> 01:00:59,770
Just a little.

1728
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:02,770
You don't have them?

1729
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:06,900
It's Ji Hyo's team.
Their food is not seasoned.

1730
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,110
- The team next to us?
- Yes.

1731
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:12,440
So everyone on our team has a liver?

1732
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,380
- We all have livers.
- We do.

1733
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,290
- One in this team has no liver.
- The one with no liver...

1734
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,750
I think it's one of the IVE members
in this team.

1735
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,750
There's one in your team.

1736
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,920
- It's So Min.
- I think it's So Min.

1737
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,230
I told you earlier
that So Min is strange.

1738
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:28,360
You've not seen the hint.

1739
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,630
Stop...

1740
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:30,770
(He's started
his staring investigation.)

1741
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,940
Stop acting like you know something.

1742
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:36,270
You have not even seen the hint.
Why are you acting like you know it?

1743
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:38,000
Don't think everything you know
is real.

1744
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,110
It's not real.

1745
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,540
"Not seasoned"
sounds like "there is no liver."

1746
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,610
- It's not seasoned.
- Not seasoned.

1747
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,610
- Just enjoy the food.
- You have not seen the hint.

1748
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,880
Why make such poor guesses?

1749
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:54,380
(Suspect 1. He said it's authentic
while eating bland food.)

1750
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,630
(Suspect 2. She tasted it
without permission.)

1751
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:02,570
(Suspect 3. She publicly said
the food is bland.)

1752
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:06,040
(Suspect 4. She puts suspicion
on the Zoned-out Crazy Sisters.)

1753
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:10,940
(Suspect 5. She's just sad
that the food came out bland.)

1754
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,770
(Which of these five rabbits
is the spy?)

1755
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,570
This is so delicious.

1756
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:22,110
I ate a lot. I ate well.

1757
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,250
I'm full.

1758
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:26,150
Now that we have...

1759
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,230
- all eaten...
- It feels nice.

1760
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:29,360
We've grown close.

1761
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,730
- That's right.
- My goodness.

1762
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,860
- That's right.
- Food is essential.

1763
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:34,630
You know, I was really surprised.

1764
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,130
Yoo Jin ate like crazy.

1765
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:37,500
Won Young ate like crazy too.

1766
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,070
- Yes. She ate with gusto.
- Won Young.

1767
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:40,900
Won Young, how do you remain skinny?

1768
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,500
I don't put on weight easily.

1769
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,770
I see.

1770
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,440
- I envy you.
- That will change once she hits 40.

1771
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,250
Why are you talking about
the age of 40 already?

1772
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,480
I am just saying.

1773
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,440
- LEESEO is 17.
- Jae Suk.

1774
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,170
- Won Young hasn't graduated yet.
- That's right.

1775
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,020
- Haven't you graduated yet?
- No.

1776
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,380
- My goodness.
- It must be coming up.

1777
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:00,820
- Suk Jin, give her a present.
- That's a nice idea.

1778
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,820
Make a promise.

1779
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,860
- Yes. Make a promise.
- Thank you.

1780
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,560
- All right. LEESEO.
- What will you buy her?

1781
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,500
- What would you like?
- Did you make a promise?

1782
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,650
- Yes. What would you like?
- Suk Jin.

1783
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,360
- Anything would be nice.
- Won Young...

1784
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:12,130
Won Young has everything
anyone could ever want.

1785
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:14,130
Won Young,
aren't you richer than me?

1786
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,110
She is an ambassador
for luxury brands.

1787
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:17,630
- Right?
- Yes.

1788
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,000
I will give you a present.

1789
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,170
My goodness.

1790
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,770
All right.

1791
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:23,310
- That's heartwarming.
- There you go.

1792
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:25,020
- That makes me look bad.
- There you go.

1793
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,020
That doesn't make you look bad.

1794
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,650
- Won Young is successful.
- Right.

1795
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,190
The successful ones should pay.

1796
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,610
- That's right.
- I agree.

1797
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,520
That's nice. I envy her spirit.

1798
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,860
Youth.

1799
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,880
Won Young, is it exciting...

1800
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,230
- to be successful?
- I am grateful,

1801
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,860
- of course.
- What kind of a question is that?

1802
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,320
- What kind of a question is that?
- Seriously.

1803
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,130
"Is it exciting to be successful?"

1804
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,860
- What's wrong with you?
- He sounded so shabby.

1805
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:46,290
- It's not like that.
- Maybe he doesn't have a liver.

1806
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,400
- I have never experienced...
- Suk Jin.

1807
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,860
- You don't have a liver, do you?
- It seems that way.

1808
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,400
- I mean...
- You don't have a liver or pride.

1809
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,000
It's not the liver.

1810
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,840
- He doesn't have a sense of shame.
- He doesn't have a sense of shame.

1811
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,880
- Seriously.
- I have a liver.

1812
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,880
- What was that?
- That's so funny.

1813
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,540
- This is fascinating.
- What's fascinating?

1814
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,750
I watched Running Man
in childhood and thought,

1815
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,820
"Will the show be present
by the time I become an idol?"

1816
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:09,730
- We should keep going.
- Yes.

1817
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:10,920
- Please keep going.
- I will root for the show.

1818
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,150
At the year-end award ceremony,
Lee Gyeong Gyu said something.

1819
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:17,130
You don't need to leave
when people are clapping.

1820
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,190
You don't need to do that.

1821
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:19,270
People clap for you
when you leave anyway.

1822
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,610
Seriously. We need...

1823
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,040
(A different point of view)

1824
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,540
- That's so funny.
- Listen.

1825
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,570
That's the important thing.

1826
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,040
LEESEO, don't you agree?
When you leave,

1827
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,820
people don't tell you to go away.
They clap for you.

1828
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:35,590
We need more than our will
to keep the show going.

1829
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,880
People clap for you
when you leave anyway.

1830
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:41,750
That's not true. You might disappear
without anyone knowing.

1831
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,480
- You never know.
- No. People usually clap for you.

1832
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,520
I am sorry about
this line of conversation, LEESEO.

1833
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,590
- I am sorry.
- I am sorry.

1834
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,170
- You will understand...
- It takes more than your will.

1835
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:52,540
what we meant...

1836
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:54,730
- about 20 or 30 years later.
- It's true.

1837
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,400
Even after 30 years...

1838
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:58,040
Even after 20 years,
she will be younger than I am now.

1839
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,770
Even after 30 years,
she will be younger than I am now.

1840
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,570
You know, we locked up
IVE members in the middle.

1841
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:04,750
- Seriously.
- For real.

1842
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,570
- We feel like criminals.
- Why are you giving them a lesson?

1843
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:08,920
In any case...

1844
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,380
- He sounds like a real adult.
- Now that we are at it,

1845
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,150
why don't you take turns...

1846
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,460
and ask the senior celebrities
a question?

1847
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:18,020
- That's a good idea.
- You might have some questions.

1848
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:20,560
- I love it.
- Ask a question each.

1849
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,520
- That's a good idea.
- It's a precious opportunity.

1850
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,670
- Rei, why don't you go first?
- We will tell you anything.

1851
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,040
If you don't have any questions,
you can pass.

1852
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,340
Pass.

1853
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,940
(Pass.)

1854
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Pass.

1855
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,770
(I don't have any questions!)

1856
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,130
- Hey.
- Hey.

1857
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,250
- Hey.
- She is good.

1858
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,570
- Jae Suk was so serious.
- Hey, Rei.

1859
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:38,770
Good job.

1860
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,650
- I can't believe you.
- Good job.

1861
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,290
- Good job.
- Good job.

1862
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:44,340
- Everyone might choose to pass.
- Seriously.

1863
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,360
She said it in a specific tone too.

1864
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,520
- "Pass."
- "Pass."

1865
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,250
- It was good.
- It was good, Rei.

1866
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,290
- It was amazing.
- It was funny.

1867
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:53,190
- Everyone might choose to pass.
- Okay. I got it.

1868
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,900
Jae Suk's ambitious segment
got shut down.

1869
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,570
"Let's start with Rei."

1870
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:58,090
- "Pass."
- "Pass."

1871
01:05:58,170 --> 01:05:59,840
I can't believe it.

1872
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,400
Now, the segment with IVE...

1873
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,630
Realistic Advice is over.

1874
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,770
Do you remember this place?

1875
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:07,210
(B sundae gukbap restaurant
at Eonju Station)

1876
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,150
- We haven't been here in a while.
- Gukbap.

1877
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:12,610
Did you visit here often
because your agency was nearby?

1878
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

1879
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:14,940
- Really?
- I see.

1880
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,690
- That must be why you came here.
- That's right.

1881
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:17,920
That must be why you came here.

1882
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,690
You are at the restaurant
LIZ frequented as a trainee,

1883
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:24,480
- B Sundae Gukbap.
- I was right.

1884
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,420
Why did you frequent
this restaurant?

1885
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,690
I felt like recording went well...

1886
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:31,420
if I ate gukbap beforehand.

1887
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,500
So I always came here
and ate gukbap.

1888
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:35,860
- I see.
- I came here before recording.

1889
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,860
- It became a ritual.
- Yes.

1890
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,730
- It will be delicious.
- Rei.

1891
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,540
Hot gukbap is perfect in winter.

1892
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,770
- It's a hearty dish.
- A hearty dish.

1893
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:45,540
- A hearty dish.
- A hearty dish.

1894
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:47,540
I will explain the mission.

1895
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,820
The mission is the Bomb Relay Dance.

1896
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,590
A member from each team
will stand in a line.

1897
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:55,190
Then the first person
will dance to the music.

1898
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:59,320
After some time, the first person
will move to the back of the line...

1899
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,230
and the next person will dance.

1900
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,170
When two minutes are up,
the music will stop.

1901
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:06,460
The member who was dancing then
will get eliminated.

1902
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,960
- It's Pass the Bomb with dancing.
- I see.

1903
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:13,230
This time, the teams
that placed 1st and 2nd...

1904
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,770
will have a chance
to switch members.

1905
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:16,940
- Switch members?
- That's sudden.

1906
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,710
- That's sudden.
- It's understandable.

1907
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,750
- It will help us catch the spy.
- That's right.

1908
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,040
- It will narrow down the search.
- That's right.

1909
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,420
- It will narrow down the search.
- I see.

1910
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,420
The first round will be
between the IVE members.

1911
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:27,820
The second round will be
between the Running Man members.

1912
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,320
The third round will be
between everyone...

1913
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,820
except for the two people
who got eliminated.

1914
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,290
- Okay.
- Okay.

1915
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,150
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1916
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,960
- LIZ, let's go.
- Let's go.

1917
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:38,500
- Let's go.
- Legend, let's go.

1918
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,900
It tickled

1919
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,710
- It tickled
- Bunnies.

1920
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,460
- Bunnies.
- Raise the volume.

1921
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,770
(Round 1 begins.)

1922
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:47,980
- My goodness.
- Don't go easy on them.

1923
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,250
("Into the New World"
by Girls' Generation)

1924
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:51,110
Time

1925
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,520
(The countdown
for 2 minutes begins.)

1926
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,040
Time

1927
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,150
Girls' Generation.

1928
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:00,790
Girls' Generation.

1929
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,880
Then the person at the front
will move to the back.

1930
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:06,750
Like that?

1931
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,070
(Then the next person will dance.)

1932
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:11,360
When two minutes are up,

1933
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,840
the person who was dancing
will be eliminated.

1934
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,360
- Say goodbye to sadness
- Say goodbye to sadness

1935
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:19,570
(Goodbye)

1936
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:21,610
There you go.

1937
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:24,310
- She can dance well.
- She is good.

1938
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,770
She is good.

1939
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,070
She is good.

1940
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,190
(Fast forward by 2 times)

1941
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,320
(Double speed)

1942
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,780
The bomb is about to go off.

1943
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,920
They have time.

1944
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,750
- Rei.
- Rei.

1945
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:40,730
(They are past the 1-minute mark.)

1946
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,990
- There you go.
- My goodness.

1947
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,160
Okay. That's good.

1948
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:48,030
Why isn't it going off?

1949
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,460
Hey, move out of the way!

1950
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,000
(Being pressed for time
makes her raise her voice.)

1951
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,310
She is scared.

1952
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:55,080
How are two minutes so long?

1953
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:57,110
- Come on.
- You need to dance.

1954
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:59,780
You need to dance.
Don't move to the back right away.

1955
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,380
Ga Eul.

1956
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:03,650
Okay.

1957
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:05,160
She is brave.

1958
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,620
Dance a bit more.

1959
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:08,360
You need to dance for a bit.

1960
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,990
You need to dance for a bit.
Don't move to the back right away.

1961
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,060
- How are two minutes so long?
- You need to stop and dance.

1962
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,200
Look at Ga Eul.

1963
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:17,960
(Time's up.)

1964
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:20,770
(Screaming)

1965
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:22,270
Isn't it LEESEO?

1966
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,610
- It's Ga Eul.
- Is it Ga Eul?

1967
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:25,000
- It was close.
- Ga Eul.

1968
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,110
It was a matter of 0.5 seconds.

1969
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:29,280
- It was close, Senior Ga Eul.
- I stepped aside.

1970
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,980
You got caught
even though you stepped aside.

1971
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,370
- You should have stopped sooner.
- Ga Eul, come here.

1972
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,870
Ga Eul, you are out.
The second round will be...

1973
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,650
- between the Running Man members.
- Okay.

1974
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:38,210
We will win.

1975
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,620
- Let's go.
- So Min.

1976
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,780
- So Min.
- So Min.

1977
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,660
- So Min. Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo.

1978
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,750
Please play a song we know.

1979
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:45,990
I will rule the solo shot.

1980
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,620
- I will stay there for a long time.
- Okay.

1981
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,290
- I will stay there forever.
- Okay.

1982
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:50,960
- Of course.
- I love solo shots.

1983
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,830
I am addicted to solo shots.

1984
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:56,160
- Let's go.
- I am addicted to solo shots.

1985
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,070
- Music, please.
- Play something we know.

1986
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,910
(How refreshing
will their relay dance be?)

1987
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,540
("Touch My Body" by SISTAR)

1988
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,040
My body

1989
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,580
(Taking off)

1990
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,880
(She starts the dance
in a sexy way.)

1991
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,910
She loves it.

1992
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:13,580
You look like an IVE member.
You are just as good as them.

1993
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,860
This song isn't by IVE.
It's by SISTAR.

1994
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:17,860
Ji Hyo.

1995
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:22,120
(She squeezes out her fresh charms.)

1996
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,590
- We have two minutes.
- Two minutes.

1997
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:24,870
Move out of the way.

1998
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:25,870
(Ji Hyo enjoys the solo shot
since she knows the dance.)

1999
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:27,330
Hey, move out of the way.

2000
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:30,000
Hey, you know the dance.

2001
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:32,200
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2002
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,580
- Touch my body
- Hey.

2003
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,480
(Here comes the grasshopper.)

2004
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:40,980
(He is extremely excited
because he likes the song.)

2005
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:43,950
My goodness.

2006
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,190
(Twerking)

2007
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:47,280
What was that?

2008
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,420
- Twerking.
- Move out of the way.

2009
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:50,690
Okay.

2010
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:52,700
It isn't ending.

2011
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:57,090
(There are no brakes
for his excitement.)

2012
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,570
Move out of the way already.

2013
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,160
(He danced solo for 30 seconds.)

2014
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,200
For goodness' sake.

2015
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,610
Okay.

2016
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,440
(Here comes Se Chan the rabbit.)

2017
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:11,310
(His dance moves are cheeky,
not refreshing.)

2018
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,740
No. I should get back to the line.

2019
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,020
(1 minute passes.)

2020
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,150
It's almost done.

2021
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:18,660
Okay.

2022
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,490
That's "Swallowtail Butterfly."

2023
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:27,530
That's "Swallowtail Butterfly."

2024
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,830
(His dance moves become big
so that people wouldn't notice.)

2025
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:32,460
(The muscular rabbit
shakes his body too.)

2026
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,630
Jong Kook, you need to move
out of the way.

2027
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,330
Move out of the way.

2028
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,110
- So Min, move out of the way.
- There you go.

2029
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:40,870
- So Min, move out of the way.
- Not yet.

2030
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,950
You are as good as them.

2031
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:44,310
(Her dance became oilier.)

2032
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,170
What's the order?

2033
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,910
- I go before you.
- All right.

2034
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:51,120
- Why isn't it ending?
- Do we still have time?

2035
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,910
It's about time.

2036
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:54,210
Move out of the way.

2037
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,750
It's about time.

2038
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,230
- It's almost done.
- It's about time.

2039
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:58,380
(2 minutes are almost up.)

2040
01:11:58,830 --> 01:11:59,950
No!

2041
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,660
(The man who is addicted
to the center position got caught.)

2042
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:04,920
Hey!

2043
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,960
I mean...

2044
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,130
Hey!

2045
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:10,410
(Jae Suk becomes the second member
to get eliminated.)

2046
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,570
- Hey!
- What?

2047
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,280
- Why did you...
- He grabbed me.

2048
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,700
- Why didn't you move to the back?
- Why did you dance?

2049
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,310
- Why didn't you move to the back?
- Why did you grab me?

2050
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:17,870
- He didn't grab him.
- He did.

2051
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:18,910
Why did you grab me?

2052
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,210
- You jerk!
- You cheated.

2053
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,450
You jerk!

2054
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:22,820
I forgot that he was on my team
and grabbed him...

2055
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:24,080
- because it was fun.
- Why did you grab me?

2056
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,120
Suk Jin loved it.

2057
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,580
- I forgot that he was on my team.
- Come on.

2058
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,990
I grabbed him too.

2059
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:31,880
- Jae Suk, you are out.
- For goodness' sake.

2060
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:35,620
For the last round,
everyone will dance for two minutes.

2061
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,770
- Not many teammates remain.
- Seriously.

2062
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,990
That was too much. He cheated.

2063
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:41,370
Please pound on my shoulder blades.

2064
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,810
I got a cramp since I danced...

2065
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,030
- after a long while.
- Did you get a cramp?

2066
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,370
- Here?
- Yes. I got a cramp there.

2067
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,840
It's because I shook my body
after a long while.

2068
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:50,670
My shoulder blades... Hold on.

2069
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,020
- My cramp is moving.
- Are you okay?

2070
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,450
It's here now.

2071
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,020
(Making a fuss)

2072
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,880
- Hold on.
- Is it moving?

2073
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,820
Why is my cramp moving?

2074
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:02,880
My shoulder blades.
The part that goes in.

2075
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,750
- Yes. That's the spot.
- Is your cramp moving?

2076
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,490
- My goodness.
- Are you okay now?

2077
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:08,090
It felt strange. I am okay now.

2078
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,700
- Did it move to your neck?
- What kind of a cramp moves?

2079
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:11,730
- Let's mix ourselves up.
- My cramp moved.

2080
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:12,830
Okay.

2081
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:16,200
If you have a song request,
we will play it.

2082
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,310
- A song by IVE. "Love Dive."
- A song by IVE?

2083
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,500
A song by IVE. "Love Dive."

2084
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,780
- "Love Dive."
- That's right.

2085
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:21,810
Play "Love Dive."

2086
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:22,840
- Does it go like this?
- Yes.

2087
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:24,950
- Do this for "Love Dive."
- After this...

2088
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:26,280
- "Love Dive."
- After this...

2089
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,740
- "Love Dive."
- I like this dance.

2090
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:30,780
It reminds me of Jang Woo Hyuk's
Hammer Dance.

2091
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,560
I don't know what it is.

2092
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,120
- Don't you know H.O.T?
- Let's begin.

2093
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,190
I can't believe it.

2094
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:37,330
I feel so old.

2095
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,660
Music, please.

2096
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:40,860
(Round 3)

2097
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:46,030
(The original singer's
facial expression changes.)

2098
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:48,440
- She is a big rabbit.
- Tick, tock.

2099
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:57,150
(It became a headband
you use to wash your face.)

2100
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:59,580
What are you doing with your eyes?

2101
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:00,910
- There you go.
- This dance is hard.

2102
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:01,950
(Nervous)

2103
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,280
Am I doing it wrong?
I am doing it right.

2104
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,150
(After the magic show,
the rabbits dance.)

2105
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:06,320
I don't know this part.

2106
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:07,710
Is this right?

2107
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:13,060
(Relaxed)

2108
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,250
She is really tall.

2109
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:19,290
(Hold your breathe
and take a love dive)

2110
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:22,960
(Rei appears with the 2nd verse.)

2111
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,330
Seriously.

2112
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:30,500
Our song is three minutes long,
so we will nearly reach the end.

2113
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,480
(Ji Hyo enters.)

2114
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,240
(She forgets what she learned
and does the Indian Dance.)

2115
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,650
Isn't that Chakra's dance?

2116
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,990
Chakra.

2117
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,780
The song is long.

2118
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,060
She is done.

2119
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:43,380
What's up with your face?

2120
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,620
(His eyes show that
he is overly absorbed.)

2121
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:46,990
(Then he does
the "Swallowtail Butterfly" dance.)

2122
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,120
He is such a middle-aged man.

2123
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,230
This dance is too hard.

2124
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:51,590
(Or the Swa Swa Dance.)

2125
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,990
That's it.

2126
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:58,160
(Se Chan perfectly recreates
the Mirror Dance.)

2127
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,830
- Do this.
- All right.

2128
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:01,410
There you go.

2129
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,170
How does he know
all the dance moves?

2130
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:05,910
(They watch Se Chan's dance.)

2131
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,820
(He forgot about the time limit.)

2132
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,410
Hurry up.

2133
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:10,740
- Done.
- There is a time limit.

2134
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,520
Hurry up.

2135
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,990
- Hurry up.
- Jong Kook, step aside right away.

2136
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:17,250
- Step aside right away.
- Hurry up.

2137
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:20,790
(The ninja-style dance time
began once more.)

2138
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,530
(Calm)

2139
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:25,160
It will end soon.

2140
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,240
Why isn't it ending?

2141
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:29,130
(Time's up.)

2142
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,870
(Se Chan got eliminated
in his attempt to get a solo shot.)

2143
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:34,370
- Okay.
- You should have stepped aside.

2144
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:37,310
- Oh, no.
- We placed first.

2145
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:39,040
- Nice.
- We placed first.

2146
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,670
Good job.

2147
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,020
- Thank you.
- LEESEO, good job.

2148
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,040
(Team Ji Hyo placed 1st
since no one got eliminated.)

2149
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,540
- Okay.
- It ended when I posed.

2150
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,780
- Exactly when you posed.
- Seriously.

2151
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:46,990
- Exactly when you posed.
- You got a solo shot.

2152
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,030
- Exactly when you posed.
- It ended when I posed.

2153
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:50,330
As soon as you did this...

2154
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:52,230
(Team Jong Kook placed 2nd
since Se Chan got eliminated.)

2155
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:57,700
Thus, Haha and Ji Hyo's team
placed first.

2156
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:59,770
(Team Ji Hyo, 1st place)

2157
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:00,770
We placed first.

2158
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:03,830
- Team Jong Kook placed second.
- We can switch the members.

2159
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:04,910
Okay.

2160
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,240
- Did we place last?
- Yes.

2161
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:09,650
The 2nd-place winner can get
1 new member from each team.

2162
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:11,080
- One member from each team.
- Yes.

2163
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:14,670
After the 2nd-place winner is done,
the 1st-place winner...

2164
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,540
can get one new member...

2165
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,450
- or keep the team as it is.
- Let's see how it goes.

2166
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:19,880
Let's choose after them.

2167
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,520
- Okay.
- Team Jong Kook, which members...

2168
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,860
do you want to switch out?

2169
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:25,450
- Which members will it be?
- If the four of us aren't a spy...

2170
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:27,290
Are some of us being switched out?

2171
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:28,560
Yes, we are.

2172
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,420
One member should be
from the team that got bland food.

2173
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,460
Then...

2174
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:38,310
(There is a Rabbit with No Liver
in Team Ji Hyo.)

2175
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,780
- Let's switch the members.
- My guess is Yoo Jin.

2176
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:41,940
- Yoo Jin?
- Yes.

2177
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,110
- Yoo Jin?
- Okay.

2178
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:45,820
We will switch Won Young and Yoo Jin.

2179
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,040
- Yoo Jin.
- As for Rei...

2180
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,210
- What?
- Won Young and Yoo Jin?

2181
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:51,820
- Hello.
- Really?

2182
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,910
Yoo Jin?

2183
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,250
- Why me?
- And?

2184
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:57,530
And we will switch Suk Jin and Rei.

2185
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,560
- Oh, yes. You are a cutie.
- Come on.

2186
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,370
- All right.
- Let's whisper.

2187
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:05,990
You are the team
that has a Rabbit with No Liver.

2188
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:08,660
- That's right.
- That rabbit is in your team.

2189
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:10,940
Then it must be her.

2190
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,740
Me? No.

2191
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:16,670
(Why did Ji Hyo point So Min out
right away?)

2192
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:18,040
No, it isn't me.

2193
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,820
Let's do this.
You want to send her away, right?

2194
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:21,980
Yes.

2195
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,650
- We need to switch up the members.
- Then send me to that team.

2196
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:25,340
- Send me to that team.
- In that case...

2197
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,520
- We need to switch up the members.
- Then send me to that team.

2198
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,580
(Why does she want to go
to the team Yoo Jin moved to?)

2199
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,530
- No.
- Switch places with Suk Jin.

2200
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:32,790
- Okay.
- Why?

2201
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:34,490
- Okay.
- You shouldn't do that.

2202
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,090
- You made it confusing.
- You shouldn't do that.

2203
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:37,570
- Why not?
- With whom?

2204
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:38,620
We just don't want her on our team.

2205
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,330
- We want one member from...
- Am I being switched out?

2206
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:43,370
- Yes.
- We are set then.

2207
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:46,030
Now, the food will be prepared.

2208
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,500
- Okay. Sit down.
- Okay.

2209
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:51,000
- It will be confusing.
- This game is so hard.

2210
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:52,650
Okay.

2211
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,020
I can't wait.

2212
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,040
Me too.

2213
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:57,210
After eating this dish,

2214
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:59,710
you will catch
the Rabbit with No Liver.

2215
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:00,750
- Really?
- Yes.

2216
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,750
(The gukbap is the last hint
to find the spy.)

2217
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,330
This is the last hint.

2218
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:04,560
We will know once we eat this dish.

2219
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,360
I don't know. Let's eat.

2220
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,560
I am curious.

2221
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,750
We will know once we eat this dish.

2222
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,370
It looks so tasty.
I will taste it first.

2223
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:13,530
(The team with the rabbit
without a liver...)

2224
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:16,000
It looks delicious.

2225
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,370
(will eat bland gukbap.)

2226
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:19,580
Okay.

2227
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,030
(Which team has the rabbit
without a liver?)

2228
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,580
- Let's go.
- It looks delicious.

2229
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:25,150
Please eat the dish now.

2230
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:27,340
I am sorry, but won't you give us
radish kimchi?

2231
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,650
- No.
- Thank you for the food.

2232
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:30,040
- We just got gukbap.
- Thank you for the food.

2233
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,080
(Kimchi got excluded
for a definite hint.)

2234
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,190
It's tasty.

2235
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:33,410
It's really tasty.

2236
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,830
It's hard to remove
the unpleasant odor of meat.

2237
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:38,880
That's right.

2238
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,160
It's really tasty.

2239
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,060
I normally can't eat food
with bad odor.

2240
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,730
I can eat this with rice.

2241
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:44,990
I want to eat it with rice.

2242
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:47,660
I am too scared to taste it.

2243
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:49,810
- Seriously. I am too nervous.
- Please enjoy the dish.

2244
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:51,110
(Did Team Ji Hyo lose
the Rabbit with No Liver?)

2245
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,240
- The unpleasant odor of meat.
- I thought it would be spicy.

2246
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:55,000
It wouldn't be spicy.

2247
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,610
Does it suit your taste?

2248
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,150
Thank you for the food.

2249
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,370
Ji Hyo.

2250
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:00,870
(It's good.)

2251
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:04,690
(Did Team Ji Hyo get tasty gukbap?)

2252
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,520
(It's tasty!)

2253
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,330
(Did Team Ji Hyo lose
the Rabbit with No Liver?)

2254
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:10,450
Suk Jin.

2255
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:12,450
Let's eat.

2256
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:15,200
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2257
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,570
It hasn't been seasoned at all.

2258
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:17,730
- Not even the sauce?
- We don't get any side dishes.

2259
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:19,130
I didn't try the sauce.

2260
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,790
- Please enjoy the dish.
- It's hard to remove...

2261
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:22,570
(Did Team Jong Kook get
bland gukbap?)

2262
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:25,110
Please. Gukbap shouldn't be bland.

2263
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,410
- It looks delicious.
- Yes.

2264
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,950
(The two strong candidates
taste the dish as well.)

2265
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:33,240
It's tasty, but I don't know
how it compares to other gukbap.

2266
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:34,820
I don't know if it's good or bad.

2267
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:35,950
You don't have a liver, do you?

2268
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:38,120
- Be honest.
- It isn't me.

2269
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,190
- Do you like gukbap?
- Seriously.

2270
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:40,780
- Isn't it tasty?
- Really?

2271
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,380
Se Chan.

2272
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,730
- Se Chan.
- What?

2273
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:46,090
- What is it?
- Isn't it bland?

2274
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:47,620
- It's bland.
- Don't engage her.

2275
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:50,920
- It's one of them.
- As I said, you need to act.

2276
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,960
My goodness.

2277
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:52,990
(Team Jong Kook
got the definite proof.)

2278
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:55,070
I think it's tasty, Yoo Jin.
I am serious.

2279
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,630
- Really?
- It's tasty.

2280
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:57,700
(So Min keeps saying
that it's tasty.)

2281
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:58,910
It's really tasty.

2282
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:01,330
My goodness.

2283
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,370
(Is she acting to keep it a secret
from other teams?)

2284
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,410
It isn't me. It really isn't me.

2285
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:09,340
Now, we will remove the boards.

2286
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:11,580
It looks like
everyone finds it delicious.

2287
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,280
- It's tasty.
- Is it tasty?

2288
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,950
- So Min, is it tasty?
- It melts in your mouth.

2289
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,250
It's really tasty.

2290
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:18,030
- Really?
- It suits my taste.

2291
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:19,860
It's really tasty.

2292
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,790
Why...

2293
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,990
It contains the soul.

2294
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,740
- This restaurant is nice.
- It's So Min.

2295
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,070
So Min?

2296
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,500
Jong Kook, don't make a mistake.
It really isn't me.

2297
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,530
Okay.

2298
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:32,940
It contains the soul?

2299
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,240
Totally.

2300
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,670
It contains the soul.

2301
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:37,450
It would be tastier with sundae.

2302
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:38,500
Sundae.

2303
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,740
Yoo Jin, you must be full.

2304
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:41,340
I ate too much earlier.

2305
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,910
I could finish the entire bowl.

2306
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:45,280
Yoo Jin, are you eating well?

2307
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,410
(Jae Suk sees
if Yoo Jin is enjoying the dish.)

2308
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:47,990
- All right.
- It's tasty.

2309
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,120
It's sweet.

2310
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,560
I have no clue.

2311
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,700
It's sweet.

2312
01:20:55,700 --> 01:21:00,400
The Rabbit with No Liver
can act well.

2313
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:04,070
- It's really tasty.
- This is a nice restaurant.

2314
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:05,810
I feel like I am in Busan.

2315
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:07,810
Are you enjoying the dish?

2316
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:09,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

2317
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,950
Soon, you will write down
the name of the person...

2318
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,580
you think is
the Rabbit with No Liver.

2319
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,150
As I explained, the members
who failed to guess correctly...

2320
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:19,450
will carry out a penalty.

2321
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,120
The Rabbit with No Liver
will receive a prize...

2322
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,060
if more than half of the members
fail to guess correctly.

2323
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:27,490
When we give you the ballot,

2324
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:31,590
write down the name
and give it back to us.

2325
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:34,570
I narrowed it down to two members.

2326
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:35,700
But there is only one.

2327
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,830
I don't know which one it is.

2328
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,310
I am torn between two members too.

2329
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,530
Which members are you talking about?

2330
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:40,670
Seriously.

2331
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:42,610
- It isn't me.
- You and who else?

2332
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:45,240
It isn't me.
You have it all wrong again.

2333
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:46,580
It really isn't me.

2334
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,650
- This is bad.
- It's you.

2335
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:54,190
(She asked to be
in the same team as Yoo Jin.)

2336
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:55,280
- It isn't me.
- Do you like gukbap?

2337
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,920
(She insisted
that the gukbap was tasty.)

2338
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,900
(Was it a strategy
to avoid suspicion?)

2339
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:03,200
It's really tasty.

2340
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,420
It really isn't me.

2341
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,030
- This is bad.
- It's you.

2342
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:08,940
Is it Yoo Jin?

2343
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,270
This is a nice restaurant.

2344
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:11,630
(Is it Yoo Jin, the member
who insists on being innocent?)

2345
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:13,030
It's really tasty.

2346
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:16,410
(She acted like
her gukbap was tasty.)

2347
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:19,620
(Why was Yoo Jin passionate
about suspecting So Min?)

2348
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:22,210
It's so confusing.

2349
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:24,080
There is only one.

2350
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,650
(The vote begins.)

2351
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:26,710
All right.

2352
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:27,950
- Give it to me.
- I voted.

2353
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:28,950
- Will I be in trouble...
- It's not me.

2354
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:30,530
- if I write two names?
- Just write one.

2355
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:33,420
It's not that you'll be in trouble.
But you can't win the prize.

2356
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,450
- I see.
- You don't get in trouble.

2357
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:36,770
Are you done?

2358
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:39,440
- I just wrote one of those two.
- I did too.

2359
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,160
It must be one of the two.

2360
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:44,200
We took a hint on the spot anyway.

2361
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,270
- Right.
- There was no hint, but...

2362
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,530
I just picked it up.

2363
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:48,080
Seriously, I will follow my gut.

2364
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,200
- My body's response.
- I followed my gut.

2365
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,310
- All right.
- I want to catch the spy.

2366
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:53,540
Let's do this.

2367
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:56,710
- All right. All votes are in.
- I'm so curious.

2368
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:58,280
(All votes are in.)

2369
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,620
I have no idea.

2370
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,860
- I'm so nervous.
- I'm really curious this time.

2371
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,530
I'll first announce who will...

2372
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:07,060
win the prize.

2373
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:08,420
Five people.

2374
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,490
(They need 7 people
to exceed the majority.)

2375
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:12,070
(Who will win the prize?)

2376
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,370
- An Yoo Jin.
- What?

2377
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,440
- LIZ.
- What?

2378
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,570
- Rei.
- What?

2379
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:18,570
It's all them.

2380
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:32,240
And Ga Eul will win the prize.

2381
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:34,300
- Yes!
- We did it.

2382
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:38,480
- Is it over like this?
- I knew it.

2383
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,670
Did they give the correct answer?

2384
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:44,740
The Rabbit with No Liver
who made you eat...

2385
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:46,240
food without salt is...

2386
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,040
An Yoo Jin.

2387
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:50,690
An Yoo Jin.

2388
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:54,160
- Was it Yoo Jin?
- My goodness.

2389
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,080
Today, we will look
for Rabbit with No Liver...

2390
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,450
who's hiding among ordinary rabbits.

2391
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,770
And, Yoo Jin,
you are the Rabbit with No Liver.

2392
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,090
The team
with Rabbit with No Liver...

2393
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:06,540
will only get dishes without salt.

2394
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:07,630
(Yoo Jin already knew
about dishes without salt.)

2395
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:09,410
I'm not good at lying.

2396
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:12,540
(She said she wasn't good at lying,)

2397
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:16,610
(but she pretended
not to know anything.)

2398
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:20,710
(If she was switched alone,
she would get caught.)

2399
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:23,190
- Send me to this team.
- Then...

2400
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:27,120
(But she escaped the crisis
when So Min voluntarily joined her.)

2401
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,550
(Then she accused So Min
of being the spy.)

2402
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:30,750
- Was it Yoo Jin?
- My goodness.

2403
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,360
I thought it was
either Ji Hyo or Yoo Jin.

2404
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,070
- It's so...
- I thought it was So Min.

2405
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:35,070
This isn't just right.

2406
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,460
So Min got eight votes.

2407
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:40,660
They don't trust me.
Did I do anything suspicious today?

2408
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:43,330
So Min had a strange look
on her face.

2409
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:45,540
Was it An Yoo Jin? My gosh.

2410
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:47,080
- Yoo Jin!
- I mean,

2411
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,370
- Yoo Jin sounded so nonchalant.
- Your tongue...

2412
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:51,120
- So Min.
- I guess So Min's tongue is numb.

2413
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,540
- She really liked the food.
- So Min said...

2414
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,120
- the food was tasty.
- It was really delicious.

2415
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,950
It was really bland,
but she really liked it.

2416
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:58,190
It could've been perfect
if we didn't have So Min.

2417
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:00,990
- Gosh, So Min.
- When Haha sent So Min,

2418
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:02,380
I thought we were doomed.

2419
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:04,730
I was thinking of Yoo Jin,
but I changed it at the last moment.

2420
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,570
Her facial expression
was somewhat unnatural.

2421
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,770
This is so bad.

2422
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,940
- I can't believe this.
- It's unbelievable.

2423
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,070
So it was Yoo Jin.

2424
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,290
- Yes!
- We did it.

2425
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:14,440
Didn't you like the food?

2426
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,410
We win the prize!

2427
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,610
- I'm so disappointed.
- This is disappointing.

2428
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:21,500
- That was so close.
- It really was.

2429
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,040
Please bring in the prize.

2430
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,820
- What is it?
- What?

2431
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:30,040
We prepared the finest
chocolate and macaroons.

2432
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,250
- My gosh.
- It's so nice.

2433
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:33,750
- It's chocolate.
- My gosh.

2434
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:35,920
It looks so delicious.

2435
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,920
- I'll announce the penalty.
- What is it?

2436
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,030
We've decided to focus...

2437
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:44,570
on promoting the new airtime
of Running Man in January.

2438
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:46,200
So today's penalty is...

2439
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:50,160
to shoot a video to promote
the new airtime of Running Man.

2440
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:53,500
It takes a really long time.
This is the worst.

2441
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,840
We will make a video with a phone
and post it on social media.

2442
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,370
How many people?
It can't be one person.

2443
01:25:58,370 --> 01:25:59,840
Those who got it wrong...

2444
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,120
- All of us?
- All of us?

2445
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,620
It's all the members of Running Man.

2446
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:03,650
Yes. It's all of us.

2447
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:05,450
- At least one of us...
- It was so close.

2448
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:07,690
- This is fun. It's really fun.
- We totally fell for it.

2449
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,620
All right.
Please get ready for the penalty.

2450
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,360
- Thank you.
- Good work today.

2451
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,990
- Good work.
- Thank you.

2452
01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:15,420
Thank you, IVE.

2453
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,160
Let's begin.

2454
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:18,830
- Where should we look?
- Is this six?

2455
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,960
- Look at the phone.
- This phone?

2456
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,070
The phone?

2457
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,330
Should we look at the phone?

2458
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:24,540
We should stand closer.

2459
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:26,330
Please stand close together.

2460
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:28,450
You stand here, So Min.

2461
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:29,840
- Can you see us?
- I'll be compared to them.

2462
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,710
- I don't dance as well as they do.
- You should stand here.

2463
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:33,240
- He's right.
- Then it will be funny.

2464
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,710
- I mean, this...
- It helps promote our show.

2465
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:35,710
They dance so well.

2466
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:37,120
It will be funny?

2467
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:38,550
Seriously...

2468
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:40,530
- You're doing this for the show.
- They can't see us.

2469
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:41,730
- You're not on the video?
- We just need to stand close.

2470
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:42,920
You should be on the video.

2471
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,250
Actually, we didn't know
so many members would lose.

2472
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:46,730
So we prepared a small background.

2473
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,920
- I know.
- We will stay close.

2474
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,900
Should we just do this in the back?

2475
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,130
- Jae Suk...
- Okay.

2476
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:52,790
- That's a good idea.
- We will do this.

2477
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:54,070
- Like this.
- Like this.

2478
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:56,160
Let's begin.

2479
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:57,870
(The shoot begins.)

2480
01:26:57,870 --> 01:26:58,980
LEESEO, we're...

2481
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,540
(Showing off his gums)

2482
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:08,150
(Only the ones in the front row
are dancing well.)

2483
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:10,150
(Dancing roughly)

2484
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:12,020
(Even his hands are wrong.)

2485
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,160
Let's begin now.

2486
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,950
- What's after like?
- What's after like?

2487
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,400
At six!

2488
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,120
You guys are doing it all.
What was that?

2489
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,120
Hey.

2490
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:23,770
(A mysterious canyon)

2491
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:25,770
(The weaklings
who want to be strong)

2492
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,440
(A teacher is coming
to teach them a lesson?)

2493
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:30,130
(A master of martial art, Jang Hyuk)

2494
01:27:30,270 --> 01:27:31,910
(Shall I warm up?)

2495
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:34,370
(With the amazing introduction,)

2496
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:36,110
(the authentic
action school begins!)

2497
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:37,710
(Scene 1: The protagonist
training jeet kune do)

2498
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:39,210
You should wrap it around like this.

2499
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,240
(Wrap it around...)

2500
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:43,450
(What?)

2501
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:44,550
You're about to kiss it.

2502
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,990
(An ugly scene)

2503
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:49,620
(Scene 2: The protagonist
starting a real fight)

2504
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:50,900
(Shouting)

2505
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,370
(Feeling strange again)

2506
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:56,270
(It's hard to tell
what genre it is.)

2507
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:58,040
(It's a scene
of a rough and tumble fight.)

2508
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,830
(And that's when...)

2509
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:01,330
(the real master of martial arts
shows up.)

2510
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:03,330
(Action star, Donnie Yen)

2511
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:05,500
(Masters of Colorful Martial Arts)
