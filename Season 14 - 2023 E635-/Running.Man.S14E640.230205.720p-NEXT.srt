1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,610
(An ordinary-looking building
in Sangam-dong)

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,910
(A secret hideout
of martial art masters)

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,210
Hello.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,780
- Hello, Jong Kook.
- Hey, you're here.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,420
Hello.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,680
- Hello.
- Hey.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,790
(Shouting)

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,560
This is "The Matrix."

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,990
(So Min is dressed
like the movie, "The Matrix.")

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,670
- Gosh, my back.
- Hey, I meant this.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,930
- Why did you do that?
- My back hurts a lot.

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,700
Sir, please tell me about my future.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,200
- I'll read your future.
- Yes, please.

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,200
- All right.
- What will happen to me?

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,460
So...

16
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,070
- What time were you born?
- This is ambiguous, right?

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,380
You look Japanese.

18
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,100
- I'm not Japanese.
- It's Japanese-style.

19
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,510
This is hanbok.

20
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,210
- Is it hanbok?
- It's hanbok.

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,420
You're wearing
something colorful today.

22
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,690
- It's red.
- Yes. This is all I had.

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,950
I wanted to wear something black.

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,660
- This is Bruce Lee.
- That's what I intended.

25
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,160
It seems like Haha will...

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,230
- try drunken boxing.
- Haha is...

27
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,450
- Look at him.
- Sir.

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,730
Are you a fortune-teller?

29
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,020
No, that's drunken boxing.

30
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,890
Do you work at the royal kitchen?

31
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,200
The royal kitchen?

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,710
- I bet he's from the royal kitchen.
- I'm scared.

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,510
(Moving abruptly)

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,400
- What?
- My gosh.

35
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,010
(Ji Seok Sam, a master
who has never hit anyone before)

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,570
Hello.

37
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,240
You look so neat and tidy.

38
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,790
- I'm...
- You look weak.

39
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,380
No. People like me are real masters.

40
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,680
- Master?
- That's right. You're a master.

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,620
Masters are dressed in black.

42
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,150
- Did you go to a hot spring?
- Shut it.

43
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,930
A hot spring?
What are you talking about?

44
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,700
You look like an informant
with the glasses on.

45
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,630
- I'm not an informant.
- I know.

46
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,200
What are you talking about?

47
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,210
- It's not like that.
- This is not working.

48
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,900
This is the traditional clothing
of Korea.

49
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,810
- Don't get me wrong.
- Why do you look like an informant?

50
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,630
- This is the traditional clothes.
- Okay.

51
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,710
Why are you dressed like a spy?

52
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,510
What did you tell them to wear?

53
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,540
- She's the same.
- Isn't this "The Matrix?"

54
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,350
- I'm a martial artist.
- This isn't a martial artist.

55
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,480
- I'm Chun Li.
- What?

56
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,790
- I'm Chun Li.
- You look nothing like Chun Li.

57
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,180
Chun Li isn't dressed like this.

58
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,290
I'm Chun Li today.

59
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,290
- You're not Chun Li.
- But...

60
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,600
- That's Michael Jackson.
- Ji Hyo.

61
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,490
You know this is how Ji Hyo talks.

62
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,700
But when the shoot ends,
she calls me on her way home.

63
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
"Hi, Ji Hyo. What's the matter?"

64
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,540
"Jae Suk, do you think
my costume was inappropriate today?"

65
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,730
(Jae Suk, do you think
my costume was inappropriate today?)

66
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,910
"So I was thinking..."

67
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,280
"No, I was just joking."

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
- I'm glad she calls you.
- "No, Jae Suk."

69
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,700
"I'll wear something
appropriate next week."

70
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,880
"Seriously, I'll make sure
I'll do things right next time."

71
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,380
Isn't Se Chan coming today?

72
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,880
- Se Chan is not here?
- The thing is...

73
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,290
Today, Se Chan has...

74
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,080
- He's not coming?
- He's shooting another show.

75
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,290
- Really?
- He couldn't make it today.

76
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,890
He does another show on Tuesday.

77
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,730
Se Chan would've dressed up
perfectly on a day like today.

78
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,890
I know.

79
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,170
Se Chan would've been excited.

80
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,730
We had to reschedule this shoot...

81
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,470
- at the last minute.
- That's right.

82
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,200
Since Se Chan can't make it today,
we prepared his life-size cut-out.

83
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,070
- Come on.
- His life-size cut-out?

84
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,010
- That's not necessary.
- There's no need.

85
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,070
- It's not a big deal.
- He's just not here.

86
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,920
He would've dressed up perfectly.

87
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,320
- That's not enough.
- His life-size cutout...

88
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,820
- This isn't just right.
- No way.

89
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,980
- Hey, you brat.
- You should've dressed up.

90
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,690
We don't have to make
his life-size cut-out.

91
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,420
So Se Chan is a cut-out.

92
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,070
- So Min, you sound serious.
- He's a cut-out.

93
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,390
Anyway, we have a special guest...

94
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,290
for today.

95
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,170
- I know that.
- I saw that on social media.

96
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,170
All right. Please come on out.

97
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,630
- He's coming already?
- So...

98
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,830
Who's that?

99
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,100
(Is he coming already?)

100
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,480
- Is he coming from there?
- He's Jong Kook's friend.

101
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,100
- Hey.
- My goodness.

102
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,220
He's the master of Wing Chun Kuen.

103
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,510
- Welcome, Hyuk.
- The master of Wing Chun Kuen.

104
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,380
- Hello.
- Hyuk.

105
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,880
(Korea's famous action star)

106
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,160
(Martial artist and actor,
Jang Hyuk)

107
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,790
- The master of Wing Chun Kuen.
- Hyuk.

108
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,100
- He's a member of Running Man.
- Hello.

109
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,790
- The master of Wing Chun Kuen.
- Hyuk, you're here.

110
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,300
You're here.

111
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,800
- Welcome.
- Hello.

112
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,300
- Stand in the middle.
- You're still good-looking.

113
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,800
- Hyuk.
- All right.

114
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,750
- He's handsome.
- He's here for Donnie Yen.

115
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,820
- That's right.
- He's the master of Wing Chun Kuen.

116
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,070
- Exactly.
- Hyuk is here with us.

117
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,880
We know nothing about martial arts,
so we need him here.

118
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,980
Actually,
Jong Kook is a good fighter...

119
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,660
- But he's not a martial artist.
- He's new to martial art.

120
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,190
- He's...
- So Hyuk came here for us.

121
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,290
It was about 20 years ago.

122
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,270
We went to a funeral.

123
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,190
And he kept trying
to show us his Jit Kune Do.

124
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,560
- Okay.
- He kept saying...

125
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,170
- this was painful.
- You mean this.

126
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,640
But it didn't hurt at all.

127
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,280
He kept insisting
that it really hurt.

128
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,640
- When you hit like this?
- Yes. So...

129
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
So this is Jit Kune Do.

130
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,280
It's called the one-inch punch.

131
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,170
It doesn't have
unnecessary movements.

132
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,740
It's a martial art
for an actual fight.

133
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,290
- That's right.
- It involves a mental fight.

134
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,590
Does it have to do with mentality?

135
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,480
- It involves a mental fight?
- Yes.

136
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,660
- It involves a mental fight?
- Yes.

137
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,790
What did you just do?

138
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,600
- I did an impression of him.
- An impression of him.

139
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,920
You're good at it.

140
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,490
- Did you just do that?
- After I hear Hyuk's voice,

141
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,930
I can do that better.

142
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,060
- I thought Hyuk was speaking.
- I did it.

143
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,100
What did you say?

144
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,210
- It involves a mental fight.
- It involves a mental fight.

145
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,710
He sounds similar.

146
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,040
You're good at this.

147
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,410
He's actually not good
at stuff like this.

148
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,350
So this is what I sound like.

149
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,420
Hyuk is the best in the country
when it comes to Jit Kune Do.

150
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,480
- This is what you do.
- He's the best actor.

151
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,250
- But the thing is...
- That's true.

152
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,990
Well... It was 2007.

153
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,420
At the Chinese
Martial Arts Festival,

154
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,690
you won the Best Rookie
Martial Artist Award.

155
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,040
You won the Best Rookie
Martial Artist Award.

156
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,670
(The Best Rookie
Martial Artist Award?)

157
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,210
- Back then...
- Is that true?

158
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,710
- I don't know why I won it.
- Really?

159
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,930
He won the Best Rookie
Martial Artist Award?

160
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,840
- Is that true?
- He's serious about this.

161
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,710
- Seriously?
- The thing is...

162
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,650
- I did some action films.
- Action films?

163
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,080
They were submitted.

164
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,810
So they watched your films
and evaluated them.

165
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,310
A martial art director said
he's Donnie Yen of Korea.

166
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,920
That's what he's called.

167
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,050
Honestly... I'm not saying this
because he's my friend.

168
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,180
When it comes to martial arts,

169
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,090
- I think he's the best actor.
- That's true.

170
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,530
Actors like Ma Dong Seok
show a powerful blow,

171
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,790
but he's different.

172
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,290
- He has splendid skills.
- He has skills.

173
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,400
Hyuk is the one
with the best skills.

174
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,560
Hyuk is good enough...

175
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,670
to replace Se Chan...

176
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,800
who couldn't make it today.

177
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,710
- Of course.
- He's better than enough.

178
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,930
- I know.
- Se Chan is not here.

179
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,600
- No, he's not.
- You didn't know, did you?

180
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,650
- I had no idea.
- He couldn't make it.

181
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,020
If he were here,

182
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,310
he would've done
an impression of you.

183
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,810
"Hello. I'm Jang Hyuk."

184
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,520
Hyuk, you look like
you are about to cry.

185
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,050
- I'm not crying.
- Your eyes are moist.

186
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,420
- That's not true.
- No?

187
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,530
No way. He's a real man.
What are you talking about?

188
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,900
You should give him rice.
He cries while eating rice.

189
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,030
Why?

190
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,360
You know the drama.

191
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,920
- He cried while eating.
- He's your friend.

192
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,360
Was it a rice ball?

193
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,930
- It was rice and soup, right?
- Yes, it was.

194
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,270
- By the way, Hyuk...
- No, it was an egg.

195
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,280
I know Jong Kook is your friend,
but why don't you get upset at him?

196
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,600
- We're friends.
- Is that why?

197
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
I parked my car at his place.

198
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,480
I see. He parked his car at your place,
so he can't be mad.

199
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,240
- That's right.
- That's why.

200
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,790
Hyuk has done Jit Kune Do
for a long time.

201
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,180
So we prepared the Wing Chun Dummy.

202
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,890
- Show us.
- That's the Wing Chun Dummy.

203
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,790
- Is it called the WingChun Dummy?
- Yes.

204
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,960
I saw it
in "The Little Dragon Maiden."

205
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,470
You saw it in the movie, right?

206
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,930
(The training from the movie
you'd want to try yourself)

207
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,300
We saw that in a movie,
but we don't know how to use it.

208
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,040
- Do you want me to hold this?
- Have you tried this lately?

209
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,210
- I haven't done this in a while.
- It's been a while, right?

210
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,440
Go ahead and practice it.

211
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,910
Show us how to use it.

212
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,850
- Go ahead and touch it.
- Right.

213
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,520
Hang on. I need to take this off.

214
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,720
All right.

215
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,250
I need to take this off.

216
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,050
He looks sturdy.
Look at his muscles.

217
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,290
- No, it's not like that.
- You look good in a turtleneck.

218
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,190
I know, right?

219
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,490
He says a turtleneck.

220
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,100
- You look good in a turtleneck.
- You look fit.

221
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,770
Jong Kook is a little too big.
But you look perfect.

222
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,270
Okay.

223
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,100
I should touch it like this.

224
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,670
- I see. Like water flows.
- You should stroke it.

225
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,340
- It goes like this.
- I see.

226
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,850
- Like this.
- So you hit it like that.

227
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,920
It looks like waves.
It's like a dance move.

228
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,810
- It's flexible.
- Right.

229
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,940
- So this is it.
- I watched it before.

230
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,520
- I watched it.
- That's it.

231
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,720
- I know this move.
- He's really good at this.

232
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,660
- And you speed up.
- You're good.

233
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,660
Make it harder.

234
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,900
Speed up.

235
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,350
This is how I start.

236
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
- My gosh.
- That's good.

237
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,170
(He speeds up
as the audience requests.)

238
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,970
(Flashy)

239
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,560
- Oh, dear.
- My goodness.

240
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,730
That's amazing.

241
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,370
(Jang Hyuk is so cool.)

242
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,600
- That's awesome.
- Hey.

243
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,480
(Groaning)

244
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,780
- That's awesome.
- Hey.

245
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,850
That was really cool.

246
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,310
This is my first time thinking
you looked really cool.

247
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,920
- So this is how it works.
- That was amazing.

248
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Haha, are you all right?

249
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,260
I couldn't hold out.

250
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,260
So this is how you do it.

251
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,450
So Min, you should try.

252
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,500
At first...

253
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,920
(Wriggling)

254
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,500
- She just does as she's told.
- Look at her face.

255
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,330
- Her face...
- The look on her face...

256
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,270
When she's told to do something,
she just tries.

257
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,380
She gives it a try anyway.

258
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
She's good.

259
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,610
- But...
- All right.

260
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,040
- This is...
- It's not bad.

261
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,620
She's pretty good.

262
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,020
She's good.

263
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,080
(She just punches it.)

264
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,440
- So Min.
- She just punches it.

265
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,680
Do you even know what you're doing?

266
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,790
This was harder than I thought.

267
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,390
- It's hard to hit it.
- Ji Hyo, you try it.

268
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,860
- Ji Hyo.
- That was pretty good.

269
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,890
I bet Ji Hyo is good.

270
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,190
- She'll do it for real.
- Ji Hyo is...

271
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,500
My goodness.

272
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,820
- Hey, what are you doing?
- My goodness.

273
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,370
- What's with her?
- My gosh.

274
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,400
What are you doing?

275
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,930
(She suddenly starts dancing.)

276
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,270
What are you doing?

277
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,170
- You're not at a club.
- What's with you?

278
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,300
Ji Hyo, this isn't a club.

279
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,650
You're not at a club, Ji Hyo.

280
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,070
The reason you hit it is...

281
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,920
- Hang on.
- You should block it.

282
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,020
It's like...

283
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,890
Let's say he's trying to punch me.

284
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,420
- I block it, then attack.
- I see.

285
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,620
- This is what we do.
- That's so cool.

286
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,050
He kept doing this at the funeral.

287
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,290
- Really?
- That was amazing.

288
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,290
It goes like this.

289
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,590
- So that's how you block an attack.
- That's what you do.

290
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,420
- So this is...
- Jae Suk.

291
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,420
Ji Hyo told me to try it.

292
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,220
So Min wants me to attack her.

293
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,770
I want to try.

294
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,430
Suk Jin, try punching me once.

295
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,540
Slowly.

296
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,430
So Min wants me to attack her.

297
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,510
- Slowly.
- I'll do it.

298
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,800
- Hang on.
- I think you'll be too fast.

299
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,200
I'll make it slow.

300
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,430
- I'll block it and hit you back.
- Okay.

301
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,520
(What?)

302
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,490
(This isn't what they promised.)

303
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,710
But So Min is...

304
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,390
- I feel bad for her.
- So Min is...

305
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,550
Are you all right?

306
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,990
- So Min.
- So Min, come here.

307
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,500
- You told me to attack you.
- I'll do it.

308
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,550
You know what?

309
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,670
So Min calls me
after she does things like this.

310
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,220
So Min calls me and says,

311
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,290
"Jae Suk."

312
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,170
"What's with Kim Jong Kook?"

313
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,830
(So Min after the shoot)

314
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,010
- "When I try to do something..."
- She can't do anything.

315
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,970
"When I try to do something..."

316
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,670
"What on earth is with Jong Kook?"

317
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,790
(Encore performance)

318
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,540
Gosh, they are...

319
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,450
The two sisters are really funny.

320
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,260
- They're funny.
- They are so funny.

321
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,860
Today, you are meeting...

322
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,260
with Donnie Yen,
the world's famous action star.

323
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,190
Donnie Yen is coming to Korea today.

324
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,290
So he's on his way here now.

325
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,090
He says he's bringing
his prized possessions for you.

326
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,430
- Really?
- Are you serious?

327
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,640
So you'll be doing the race
for Donnie Yen's prized possessions.

328
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,910
It's called The Colorful Master
of Martial Arts.

329
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,150
After each mission,

330
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,010
you'll get swords
of the color you chose...

331
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,750
for the Pirate Roulette Game.

332
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,180
Donnie Yen will play
the Pirate Roulette Game...

333
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,080
with the swords you gather
during the race.

334
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,260
If the Pirate pops out
with the sword of your color,

335
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,290
- you win the prize.
- I see.

336
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,490
- I'll be sure to win this prize.
- Me too.

337
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,590
I'll give it to my dad.

338
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,160
We will start
the first mission, then.

339
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,500
- What is it?
- I'll explain the first mission.

340
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,640
All right, Donnie Yen.

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,110
- It's about balancing.
- It must be difficult.

342
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,960
I'll explain the rules.

343
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,540
The first mission is called
The Unknown Master of Martial Arts.

344
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,700
You'll get on the circular platform
as the masters of martial arts.

345
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,570
You will attack
one of the two people...

346
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,990
standing next to you
with the edge of the hand.

347
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,660
If you touch the person's arm
between the hand and the elbow,

348
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,680
you succeed.

349
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,790
The ones standing
next to the attacker...

350
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,720
can change their posture...

351
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,590
to avoid the attack.

352
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,170
You will be ranked
according to the result of the game.

353
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,370
Okay.

354
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,790
(The players step up.)

355
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,800
- I'm scared.
- My gosh.

356
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,700
Let's decide who will go first.

357
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,740
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

358
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,700
- The first one to go?
- Yes. We should decide.

359
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Seok Sam, you go first.

360
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
All right. You go first.

361
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,250
- It goes counterclockwise.
- Okay.

362
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,520
If you fall off, you're eliminated.

363
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,920
Is Jong Kook the next one to go?

364
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,540
You shouldn't fall off.

365
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,250
You're eliminated if you fall.

366
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,620
- My gosh.
- This is no joke.

367
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,290
What do I do?

368
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,030
You're eliminated if you fall.

369
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,820
(The fake martial artists
brace themselves.)

370
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,190
I'll get rid of you.

371
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,320
This is...

372
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,530
(Shaking)

373
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,330
Gosh, this is no joke.

374
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,190
(The game starts.)

375
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,610
- Who goes first?
- Who's first?

376
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,770
- Seok Sam.
- Me?

377
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,930
(Shouting)

378
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,110
(The attack fails.)

379
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,040
He has never tried martial arts.

380
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,020
(So Min is up next.)

381
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,680
- Is it your turn?
- Sure.

382
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,680
- Is it your turn?
- Sure.

383
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,950
No. It's his turn.

384
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,620
- No, it's her.
- It's me.

385
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,990
You should've said it was your turn.

386
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,990
It's clockwise.

387
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,290
- Why... So Min...
- Excuse me.

388
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,500
- You should've said that.
- It's So Min's turn.

389
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
I could dodge it.

390
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,690
- I thought it was his turn.
- Fold your arm.

391
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,140
- My gosh.
- You guys...

392
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,830
never give each other a break.

393
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,110
I didn't try to defend at all.

394
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,510
- You hit me here.
- Okay.

395
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,510
- It's from here to here.
- You can't fold your arms.

396
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,700
Around the forearm muscles.

397
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,920
(It's Jae Suk's turn.)

398
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,070
Who's his target?

399
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,890
(Jang Hyuk?)

400
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,680
(Or Haha?)

401
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,020
Go ahead and do it. This is hard.

402
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,160
(A surprise attack)

403
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,360
(They just take it out
on each other.)

404
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,420
Hey.

405
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,460
- This is fun.
- He's so annoying.

406
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,630
Okay.

407
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,690
He's so annoying.

408
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,190
(Jae Suk lost his right arm
when he was off his guard.)

409
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,330
He was off his guard.

410
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,270
- Gosh, this is...
- He's quiet, but he's strong.

411
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,540
- It's Jong Kook's turn, right?
- Yes.

412
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,420
(It's the most dangerous man,
Excited Kim Jong Kook.)

413
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,310
I have a bad feeling.

414
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,580
He got hit.

415
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,160
- He got it.
- Get off.

416
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,660
- But you're...
- You're eliminated.

417
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,000
- You're out.
- You're eliminated.

418
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,190
- Get off.
- Give me three arms.

419
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,930
- You're out.
- Give me three arms.

420
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,460
I want three arms.

421
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,910
- Give me three arms.
- Just get off.

422
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,330
- Why are you being like this?
- My gosh.

423
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,930
I'm so upset.

424
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,340
(The next attacker is So Min.)

425
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,810
- All right.
- You got hit.

426
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,890
- All right.
- You got hit.

427
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,920
No, he hit my watch.

428
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,050
- Your watch...
- It was the watch.

429
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,160
- Your arm is cut.
- It was the watch.

430
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,360
- That's ambiguous.
- The watch.

431
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,030
- It was the watch.
- It's ambiguous.

432
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,360
- He hit the watch.
- You're safe.

433
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,000
- It's thick.
- Okay. You're safe.

434
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,530
- This is a foul.
- You hit the watch.

435
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,720
- The watch.
- You weren't here.

436
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,040
It didn't start yet.

437
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,740
- I hit you.
- You got hit.

438
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,740
- You got hit.
- You got hit.

439
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,040
(Upset)

440
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,380
(Little Ha breaks forth with anger.)

441
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,250
You got hit.

442
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,880
You got hit.

443
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,810
(The strange action scene
only hurts your ears.)

444
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,520
You're out. Get off.

445
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Why would I get off?

446
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,710
- Hey, switch with me.
- You got hit.

447
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,160
- What are you talking about?
- No.

448
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,490
Just get off.

449
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,680
- Give me three arms.
- I...

450
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,490
- I hit him first.
- All right. Let's do it again.

451
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,920
You two will do it again.

452
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,320
- Haha goes first.
- Haha, you first.

453
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
- This is so upsetting.
- He hit me over here.

454
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,290
I'm strong enough to cut the watch.

455
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,460
They are being childish.

456
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,800
- He's safe. And I'll go next.
- You two are safe. Haha goes next.

457
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,640
- I'm next to go.
- Are you sweating?

458
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,670
- Yes. I'm sweating.
- Look at Jong Kook.

459
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,410
This is so fun. Can I join you?

460
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,670
- I go first.
- Why?

461
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,700
- Hyung In told me to go first.
- All right.

462
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,620
- We should move like this.
- Do you have both hands?

463
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,750
Gosh...

464
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,340
Gosh. He's so cheap.

465
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,020
(Dirty)

466
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,360
- He's so crafty.
- Hey, So Bal.

467
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,620
Just come here.

468
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,050
Who's turn is it?

469
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,720
Is your right arm out?

470
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,690
My right arm is out. Hyuk hit it.

471
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,870
Hyuk is next.

472
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,010
Nice.

473
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,740
(Jae Suk is eliminated.)

474
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,410
- Okay.
- That wasn't even close.

475
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,570
So Min is still up there.

476
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,170
So Min still has one arm.

477
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,170
(So Min is still alive,
but Jong Kook is up next.)

478
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,990
- You're making me sweat.
- Do you think you can dodge it?

479
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,420
Do you think you can dodge it?

480
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,180
- You think?
- Make it quick.

481
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,190
It was the wrist.

482
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,450
- You got hit.
- You got hit.

483
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,770
- You got hit.
- So Min, come here.

484
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,920
Hurry and come.

485
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,900
It's already over.

486
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,060
Close the distance.

487
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,370
Let's shake it.

488
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,300
- Seriously.
- All right.

489
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,140
- Okay.
- This is disappointing.

490
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,280
All right. Good.

491
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,970
It was really scary.

492
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,380
(Haha's attack is successful.)

493
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,420
He's good.

494
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,670
(Shouting)

495
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,890
He hit me.

496
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,120
(Shouting)

497
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,490
(Roaring)

498
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,860
(With the martial art masters'
flashy movements,)

499
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,360
(3 arms got eliminated
only in 5 seconds.)

500
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,420
Gosh, this is really fun.

501
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,900
- My gosh.
- He's in trouble.

502
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,530
(Right at the moment...)

503
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,910
He's in trouble.

504
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,730
(Ji Hyo is eliminated.)

505
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,730
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

506
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,650
You shouldn't move.

507
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,940
You can't move like that.

508
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,170
(He's so terrified that his eyes,
nose, and mouth become petty.)

509
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,580
(Groaning)

510
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,920
(Will Haha be able to survive?)

511
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,860
- Haha... Is he doing it? No?
- He'll go right away.

512
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,060
- It's Jong Kook's turn.
- Is it Jong Kook?

513
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,750
(Haha is eliminated.)

514
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,860
- It's the two friends.
- All right.

515
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,800
They each have one arm left.

516
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,060
Only one arm?

517
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,260
It's Hyuk's turn, right?

518
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,990
- But Hyuk was...
- Show us your Jit Kune Do.

519
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,760
His posture looks cool.

520
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,230
- He's different.
- He looks stable.

521
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,140
(It's Jang Hyuk's turn to attack.)

522
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,200
His posture looks cool.

523
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,500
- He's different.
- He looks stable.

524
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,820
(It touched!)

525
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,180
(Laughing)

526
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,940
- That was really fun.
- Okay.

527
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,180
- He hit him.
- Okay.

528
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,390
I've never seen Jong Kook
sweat like that before.

529
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,830
- It was a lot of fun.
- He's sweating a lot.

530
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,830
It was fun.

531
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,830
That was a workout.

532
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,750
- That was fun.
- You will be rewarded by rank.

533
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,170
The winner will get seven swords.

534
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,020
- I should've won this.
- Second place will get six,

535
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,140
third will get five, and so on.

536
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,570
I should've done better.

537
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,810
- First of all...
- That's a huge gap.

538
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,470
The winner will go first
and choose the sword they want.

539
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,840
- Then...
- The game was very important.

540
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,500
The game was important.

541
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,770
Exactly. You should've told us that.

542
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,940
- Why didn't you tell us?
- If we had known...

543
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,350
We wouldn't have
fooled around like that.

544
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,010
- Every game is important.
- Red.

545
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,090
- The red one?
- Yes.

546
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,280
(Jang Hyuk gets 7 red swords.)

547
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,450
Wait. Am I next?

548
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,980
I choose black.

549
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,420
(Jong Kook gets 6 black swords.)

550
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,660
- Next.
- These look cool.

551
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,300
- Haha.
- Can I choose whatever I want?

552
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,960
- I choose the gold one.
- Gold?

553
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,520
- Ji Hyo.
- I'll take the blue one.

554
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,800
- White.
- Yellow-green.

555
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,900
Do I take what's left?

556
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,610
You will change clothes before
moving on to the next mission.

557
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,910
- Okay.
- Got it.

558
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,110
But what I'm wearing is comfortable.

559
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,670
- Anyway, Donnie Yen will be here.
- Donnie Yen.

560
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,880
We watched a lot of Donnie's movies.

561
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,050
- Of course.
- Exactly.

562
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,090
"Ip Man" and...

563
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,440
I even watched
"Seven Swords" yesterday.

564
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,710
- Really?
- I watched "Seven Swords."

565
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,950
- Ji Hyo's father...
- He's a huge fan.

566
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,220
He's a big fan of Donnie's.

567
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,560
He's a fan?

568
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,070
Mr. Young Chang is a huge fan.

569
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,220
(The world star has fans
all over the world.)

570
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,230
Who's Young Chang?

571
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,230
That's my father.

572
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,070
- Anyway, when he gets here...
- Yes?

573
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,310
You should know
that he has a busy schedule.

574
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,700
- Of course.
- Of course, he's busy.

575
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,910
We've been abroad as well, remember?

576
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,470
- We know how it is.
- Exactly.

577
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,320
Even though Donnie
wants to stay longer,

578
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,010
- he can't.
- Exactly.

579
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,710
It's why we'll be
squeezing the games in.

580
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,280
Hyuk. Isn't it your first time...

581
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,850
- seeing Donnie Yen?
- That's right.

582
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,950
- Haven't you been a fan?
- I have no doubt about it.

583
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,680
Well, of course.

584
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,860
- From movies like "Ip Man"...
- Exactly.

585
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,990
"Blade 2."

586
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,830
- He looked cool in "Blade 2."
- He was in that movie.

587
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,670
- Was he in "Blade 2?"
- He was.

588
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,490
- This time around...
- You have no idea.

589
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,030
You should know that he'll be in
"John Wick: Chapter 4."

590
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,640
- He's in that movie.
- Yes, in "John Wick: Chapter 4."

591
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,410
- Is he in that movie?
- Yes, "John Wick: Chapter 4."

592
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,930
- It'll hit the theaters in March.
- You should know...

593
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,730
- that he's a Hollywood celebrity.
- Exactly.

594
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,650
- He has international fame.
- Of course.

595
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,470
For some reason, Donnie Yen...

596
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,440
- He reminds me of Nam Chang Hee.
- Yes, Chang Hee.

597
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,850
- Why isn't he here today?
- As you know,

598
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,120
- he mimics Donnie a lot.
- From this.

599
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,250
They're practically the same.

600
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,710
- It'll be our first encounter.
- Exactly.

601
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,130
But he'll seem oddly familiar.

602
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,660
- They look exactly the same.
- Exactly.

603
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,920
(Fake Donnie Yen)

604
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,220
- Seriously?
- Yes.

605
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,930
- He...
- They look exactly the same.

606
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,170
He mimics the facial expressions
of Donnie Yen doing martial arts.

607
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,260
It's him in action scenes.

608
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,030
We talked about...

609
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,770
- having Chang Hee over.
- You should know...

610
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,500
that his facial expressions...

611
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,580
resemble that of Donnie Yen.

612
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,000
- I agree.
- He has gotten better looking.

613
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,200
That's right.

614
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,580
- What...
- Hold on.

615
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,920
What's going on?

616
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,850
I can't believe it.

617
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,010
- He must be here.
- He's here.

618
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,210
- Behind us.
- Where is he?

619
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,210
(With the soundtrack
from his legendary movie "Ip Man")

620
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,950
(He got off the plane and came
straight over to Running Man.)

621
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,390
- It's Donnie Yen.
- Where?

622
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,660
(Donnie Yen)

623
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,670
- It's Donnie Yen.
- Master!

624
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,170
(The man who is welcomed
with cheers)

625
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,370
Master!

626
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,280
(Along with Bruce Lee,
Jackie Chan, and Jet Li,)

627
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,250
(he is a legendary action star
of the Great China Region.)

628
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,250
(The leading man in "Ip Man"
who captivated the world.)

629
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,950
Donnie Yen!

630
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,520
(Even at 61 years of age,
he is still in his prime.)

631
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,610
He looks so young.

632
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,690
No way.

633
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,690
- He looks so young.
- He looks young for his age.

634
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,320
(Eyes light up
for the fans of Donnie Yen.)

635
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,890
Can we say hello?

636
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,530
Since Donnie Yen is here,

637
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,740
- we should ask him...
- Right.

638
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,200
- to greet the viewers.
- Yes.

639
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,310
- Yes.
- Yes.

640
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,060
Hello, everybody in Korea.

641
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,740
I'm Donnie Yen.

642
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,240
It's really nice to be here.

643
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,050
I'm very happy...

644
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,550
- The Year of the Rabbit.
- That's right.

645
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,020
I wish everybody
health and happiness.

646
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,840
- Yes!
- All right!

647
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,990
Happy New Year.

648
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,290
You have a good voice.

649
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,880
Why don't we talk more after we sit?

650
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,990
Let's have a seat.

651
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,190
(Talking with
an international celebrity)

652
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,730
He's so cool.

653
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,530
You should know that...

654
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,200
he's older than Suk Jin.

655
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,500
- That's right.
- I'm amazed.

656
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
- Doesn't he look young for his age?
- He does.

657
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,700
Since a young age,
he learned tai chi.

658
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,210
- He trained...
- Yes.

659
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,330
by getting up at 6 a.m.

660
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,900
- They do it a lot in the park.
- This... Right.

661
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,370
My mother ran a dojo
when I was a young boy.

662
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,020
She woke me up at 5 a.m...

663
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,290
and had me train in martial arts.

664
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,290
Is that so?

665
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,760
We have a video of him
honing his techniques...

666
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,260
and building a muscular body.

667
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,060
- Right? We have one prepared.
- Great.

668
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,230
He must really be flexible.

669
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,700
I had no idea he'd be that flexible.

670
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,060
He's really flexible.

671
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,590
- No way.
- Look at his splits.

672
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,440
Check out his fists.

673
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,630
His punches are fast.

674
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,540
- Gosh.
- Check out his body.

675
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,370
Should you be looking
at the camera like that?

676
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,550
Donnie, you're glaring
at the camera.

677
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,780
Should you be doing that?

678
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,140
I try to train as much as I can
when I have the time.

679
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,990
I've been doing martial arts
since I was a kid...

680
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,190
and have been filming movies
for 40 years since I was 19.

681
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,820
- For 40 years.
- For 40 years.

682
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,730
- For 40 years.
- Yes, for 40 years.

683
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,420
It must get old though.

684
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,730
- I respect him a lot.
- Yes.

685
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,270
Hyuk gets up early...

686
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,800
- to train as well.
- Really?

687
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,200
He has been working out every day
for over 20 years.

688
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,540
- For 27 years.
- He has never skipped a day.

689
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,940
For 27 years?

690
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,770
- I worked out every day.
- Bodybuilding?

691
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,440
Bodybuilding, boxing,

692
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,040
- and everything else.
- Boxing too?

693
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,510
Anyway,

694
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,750
- the Wing Chun Dummy...
- Right.

695
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,380
Can we ask Donnie
to give us a demonstration?

696
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,410
Good idea.

697
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,690
- I'd like to demonstrate.
- Can you do it?

698
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,790
Can I do it?

699
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,190
There you go.

700
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,560
But...

701
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,850
- But I'm old.
- Can...

702
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,390
I know, but it's fine.

703
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,230
Just slightly.

704
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,660
Then, Donnie Yen...

705
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,160
- A brief demonstration.
- Yes, a brief one.

706
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,800
(What will the action star
of 40 years show us?)

707
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,200
I can't believe
I'm getting to see this in person.

708
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,240
I can't wait.

709
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,440
Donnie will demonstrate
how one trains with this.

710
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,570
- I'm getting to see this in person.
- Exactly.

711
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,900
(He begins.)

712
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,810
(The expert shows his power moves.)

713
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,080
(Gosh)

714
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,320
No way.

715
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,300
(No one can afford to even blink.)

716
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,660
- My gosh.
- No way.

717
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,800
(The end)

718
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,040
(You couldn't look away
from the action star's movements.)

719
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,100
Donnie, no way.

720
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,160
- He said he'd go gentle.
- I can't believe it.

721
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,010
It's why I wasn't expecting much.

722
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,010
- Go ahead.
- I can't.

723
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,040
Hyuk, go ahead.

724
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,050
Show us.

725
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,370
- Take this off.
- Hyuk, come on.

726
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,570
Drop the bag and show us.

727
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,780
- That's right.
- Show us.

728
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,610
- I'm excited.
- I do it...

729
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,080
- in a different style though.
- I see.

730
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,560
(Take that!)

731
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,890
It's not like what you did earlier.

732
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,390
(Donnie Yen is watching.)

733
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,120
- This isn't like before.
- This isn't what you did earlier.

734
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,890
- He's serious.
- You're taking this seriously.

735
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,160
Hey.

736
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,860
Look at him taking this seriously.

737
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,630
This isn't like before.

738
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,740
You devoted yourself just now.

739
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,010
- You did your best.
- Very good.

740
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,210
- You tried really hard.
- What do you think?

741
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,710
What did you think?

742
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,670
It was really nice.

743
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,140
- It was really nice.
- Really?

744
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,610
Wing Chun Kuen and Jit Kune Do.
He executed them both well.

745
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,690
What you did
was Jit Kune Do, right?

746
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,720
Yes, I can tell.

747
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,260
The side steps
were from Jit Kune Do.

748
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,350
It's a little different.

749
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,060
He has a good understanding
of martial arts.

750
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,120
The demonstration he gave us...

751
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,360
I mean...

752
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,500
- It was different.
- Yes, it seemed different.

753
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,770
It seemed different to me.

754
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,830
The level of energy was different.

755
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,810
Could we perhaps learn...

756
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,130
- something simple?
- Could he teach us a few moves?

757
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,710
- Something we can learn.
- Just one.

758
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,040
How about a simple move?

759
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,250
This is Wing Chun Kuen.

760
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,480
(He starts off
with the Wing Chun Kuen.)

761
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,840
- His moves.
- They're different.

762
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,580
(There's energy coming
from even his fingertips.)

763
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,410
- His moves.
- He's extending his hand...

764
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,880
so that he can pull it back.

765
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
- I see.
- He then pulls it back.

766
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,420
- No way.
- Rotate the wrist.

767
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,730
(Take that!)

768
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,890
What a powerful move.

769
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,770
(Donnie suddenly teaches them
a few more moves.)

770
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,940
Did you see that?

771
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,100
I could feel his energy.

772
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,600
Wing Chun Kuen is
a form of martial arts...

773
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,070
from the Southern Chinese region.

774
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,280
Did you see this move?
It's like a tiger.

775
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,640
(The moves embody those of a tiger.)

776
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,050
It's like a dragon, right?

777
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,340
It's like a dragon, right?

778
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,110
- A dragon.
- Like this?

779
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,030
You know Jackie Chan.

780
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,350
Jackie Chan.

781
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,530
- Drunken boxing.
- Drunken boxing.

782
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,470
(He suddenly performs
drunken boxing.)

783
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
(He's just a drunkard.)

784
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,400
That was so cool.

785
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,560
Did you see his drunken boxing?

786
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,170
- His drunken boxing?
- Tell me about it.

787
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,310
Yes, like Jackie Chan.

788
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,900
(When mimicked by him,
he looks like a drunkard.)

789
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,140
I can't believe it.

790
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,070
Anyway, Donnie Yen
is joining us today.

791
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,110
I doubt we'll spend all day
just talking to him.

792
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,520
- Just as you were informed earlier,
- Yes.

793
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,110
you will play a game
where you will win swords.

794
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,190
- What's the game?
- The game is...

795
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,850
Martial Arts Foot Volleyball.

796
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,960
- Martial Arts Foot Volleyball?
- Yes.

797
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,260
Along with Donnie Yen,

798
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,230
you will play foot volleyball
in two teams of four.

799
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,230
Foot volleyball?
I wonder if he's played it before.

800
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,470
- Foot volleyball.
- Does he know the rules?

801
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,300
Have you ever played
foot volleyball?

802
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,540
- Can you play foot volleyball?
- I don't know.

803
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,100
- Oh, you don't know?
- He doesn't seem to know.

804
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,040
- It's similar to volleyball.
- He'll learn fast.

805
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,370
The basic rules are the same
as regular foot volleyball,

806
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,780
but whenever you touch the ball,
you should make the sound...

807
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,220
that reminds you of martial arts
that your opponent team chooses.

808
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,580
- Like yelling, "Abyo?"
- Yes, just like that.

809
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,840
- "Abyo!"
- Oh, I see.

810
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,290
If you don't make the sound,
your opponent team gets one point.

811
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,230
- Okay. Got it.
- The first team...

812
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,760
- to get 31 points wins.
- Okay.

813
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,530
The members of the winning team...

814
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,300
- will receive seven knives.
- Seven knives?

815
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,500
- Oh, the winning team?
- The losing team gets five knives.

816
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,800
- Got it.
- Okay. I understand.

817
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,010
- We divided you into two teams.
- Yes.

818
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,940
- I'll start with the four-member team.
- Okay.

819
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,600
- Hyuk,
- Oh, my.

820
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,370
Jae Suk, Haha, and So Min
are on the same team.

821
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,310
- So Min is on my team?
- So Min is on the other team.

822
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,080
- The ones on Donnie's team...
- So the rest of us...

823
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,190
- We're on Donnie's team.
- are Suk Jin,

824
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,960
- Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo.
- Oh, yes.

825
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,190
- Okay.
- We're on the same team.

826
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,730
- Okay.
- I'm on your team.

827
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,120
- Yes.
- Great.

828
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,890
- We'll move to the back...
- We're on Donnie's team.

829
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,920
- to begin the game.
- Okay.

830
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,800
- Okay.
- Let's go.

831
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,330
Then Hyuk and I...

832
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,970
Hyuk, have you played it before?

833
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,860
- While serving in the military.
- That's good enough.

834
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,830
- I'll receive the ball at the back.
- Okay. You do that.

835
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,140
Can we pass the ball
as many times as we want?

836
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,220
- We can only pass it three times.
- Before...

837
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,340
- Okay. I understand.
- Yes.

838
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,340
- Okay. We'll begin.
- Yes.

839
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,880
- That's one.
- One and...

840
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,220
- And two.
- Two.

841
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,560
- You go.
- And three.

842
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,690
- Okay.
- Nice.

843
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,880
(Donnie kicks the ball
over the net easily.)

844
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,650
- Is this your 1st time?
- Yes, this is my 1st time.

845
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,230
Oh, my. Why are you so good?

846
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,120
- Indeed. Donnie is so good at this.
- No.

847
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,300
Two.

848
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,360
That's good.
He's amazing as expected.

849
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,000
You can also kick it over the net
without passing it.

850
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,940
- Oh, okay.
- Yes.

851
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,010
- Okay?
- Yes.

852
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,510
(Screaming)

853
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,780
It went out.

854
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,980
- He got too excited.
- Why would he do that?

855
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,870
- He's trying to impress Donnie.
- Exactly.

856
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,840
- Why did you kick it so hard?
- Gosh, seriously.

857
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,990
Oh, yes.

858
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,910
And do we have to make the sound?

859
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,850
- Yes, we have to make the sound.
- What sound?

860
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,290
- A kung fu sound.
- "Woo."

861
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,760
- Yes, whatever you want.
- "Ada!"

862
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,730
- Yes.
- Exactly. Okay.

863
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,300
- What do you want?
- You choose.

864
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,530
- You pick one.
- What do you want? Wing Chun Kuen?

865
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,920
- How about this?
- Yes?

866
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,200
- Instead of a high-pitched shout,
- Yes?

867
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,770
- how about a low-pitched shout?
- A high-pitched shout?

868
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,010
- Ha!
- Ha!

869
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,400
- Like this.
- Hey, you.

870
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,100
- We should shout, "Ha?" Okay.
- Try it.

871
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,570
- Ha!
- Ha!

872
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,070
- So Min, try it.
- Ha!

873
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,670
(Shouting weirdly)

874
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,950
- That's not it.
- Lower your pitch more.

875
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,810
- Ha.
- Ha.

876
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,550
- How do I do that?
- My gosh.

877
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,690
- You can do as you just did.
- Ha.

878
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,020
- Ha.
- Lower your pitch. Good.

879
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,490
We want a very high-pitched shout.

880
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,030
- A high-pitched shout.
- How? Show us.

881
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,320
- Abyo!
- Right.

882
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,460
- Abyo! Okay.
- That's good.

883
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,890
- Abyo!
- That's right.

884
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,860
- Abyo! Okay.
- Okay.

885
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,360
- Okay. That's great.
- Abyo!

886
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,970
- Good. Donnie's ready.
- Okay.

887
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,090
If you don't make the sound,
your opponent team gets one point.

888
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,770
Got it. If we don't make the sound.

889
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,810
My throat hurts already.

890
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:06,940
- Abyo!
- Right.

891
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,900
I'm sorry, but this is Donnie's
first time playing this game.

892
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,210
- So please go easy on him.
- All right.

893
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,410
Will Donnie play in the back row?

894
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,110
- He should play in the front row.
- It's up to him.

895
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,110
Your position is there.

896
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,720
- He should be in the front row.
- Oh, okay.

897
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,790
- He should play in the front row.
- The main position.

898
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,880
- Okay. That's good.
- Oh, I'm covering him.

899
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,380
- I'm covering Donnie.
- It's an attack position.

900
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,580
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

901
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,190
Which team should serve first?

902
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,800
- How about rock-paper-scissors?
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

903
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,960
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Rock-paper-scissors

904
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,120
- Okay.
- You serve first.

905
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,920
- We'll begin without practicing.
- Okay.

906
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,860
I'll receive the ball by heading it.

907
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
- Let's do this!
- We've got this!

908
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,280
- Abyo!
- Ha!

909
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,310
Hey, what was that?

910
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,780
(She headed the ball
toward the floor.)

911
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,310
Let it go to us
when the ball comes like that.

912
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,250
- So Min, I told you several times.
- Also...

913
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,140
- So Min, you should make the sound.
- Right. Why didn't you shout?

914
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,690
She didn't shout either.

915
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,820
(Donnie is thoroughly
checking the play.)

916
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,080
The score is 2 to 0.

917
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,320
He's quite strict.

918
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,000
- Why didn't you say "abyo?"
- Oh, I forgot.

919
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,920
(He didn't make the sound.)

920
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,590
(The game continues for now.)

921
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,940
Suk Jin, head the ball.

922
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,400
- Good.
- What are you doing?

923
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,240
- You should've shouted, "Abyo!"
- Why did you kick it here?

924
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,510
- What did I do?
- "Abyo!"

925
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,510
It was hard to receive.

926
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,710
No, it wasn't. You should've stepped
back and received it.

927
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,450
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

928
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,780
- You didn't shout when serving.
- You should shout when serving too.

929
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,580
- Go ahead. I'll receive it.
- Okay.

930
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,990
- I'll start.
- Our team is doing well.

931
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,220
Go easy on us since Donnie is here.

932
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,650
- We're invincible.
- Ha!

933
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,880
- I said, take it easy. Okay!
- Gosh.

934
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,350
(The boy monk from Shaolin Temple
made a ridiculous mistake.)

935
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,500
What's wrong with you?

936
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,390
- Hey, Donnie...
- Donnie hasn't touched the ball.

937
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,390
It's 2 to 2.

938
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,200
- Oh, it's 3 to 2.
- Do you want to try it?

939
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
- Sure.
- Just one time.

940
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,740
- Can I bounce it...
- Say, "Abyo!"

941
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,040
- Yes. Whatever you want.
- Can I bounce it?

942
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,310
- I'm sure he'll do well.
- Yes.

943
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,470
He seemed good at kicking a ball.

944
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,010
- Okay. Ready?
- Okay.

945
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,210
(Everyone is excited to see
the martial arts master serve.)

946
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,370
- Okay. Yes?
- Donnie. Abyo!

947
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,520
- Abyo!
- Oh, my. That's great.

948
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,490
- Nice.
- He's good at kicking a ball.

949
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,560
- You should kick like that.
- Right.

950
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,220
- You should shout.
- He didn't make the sound.

951
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,030
- Jae Suk, you didn't shout.
- Oh, right. Oh, man.

952
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,120
- He didn't make the sound.
- Gosh, I forgot to shout.

953
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,200
- He's good at kicking a ball.
- Okay.

954
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,360
(Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Suk Jin,
and Donnie didn't shout.)

955
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,800
- Right. We didn't shout.
- Why didn't you make the sound?

956
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,040
- Right.
- Why didn't you shout?

957
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,470
- Come here.
- Sorry.

958
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,400
- Sorry.
- Abyo!

959
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,600
(They focused on the game so much
that they forget to shout.)

960
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,310
- Sorry. Okay.
- Abyo!

961
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,600
Can't we play the game
without shouting?

962
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,720
- Right.
- Abyo!

963
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,780
- So we don't have to shout?
- We'll play it without that rule.

964
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,080
- I can shout if I want, right?
- Okay.

965
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,640
- To make it simpler for Donnie.
- I see. Okay.

966
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,380
- Here we go.
- Okay.

967
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,910
- I just want to do it.
- You don't have to.

968
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,080
- Let's go.
- Okay.

969
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,260
- Okay.
- Good.

970
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,700
- Haha, what's with you today?
- It's okay.

971
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,390
Haha, what's with you today?

972
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,800
- It's okay.
- What's with Haha?

973
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,230
- Head it. Okay!
- Okay!

974
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,000
- Ji Hyo, head it!
- That's good.

975
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,200
- Okay!
- Good.

976
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,240
- Here.
- That's great.

977
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,830
- Hyuk, here you go. Hurry.
- Oh, my. He did well.

978
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,240
(K-Donnie Yen kicks the ball!)

979
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,310
- Great! Oh, no!
- Okay.

980
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,750
(But the original Donnie Yen
made a mistake.)

981
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,950
- Okay.
- Okay.

982
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,020
- I wanted to do this.
- That's allowed, right?

983
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,810
- I can do that, right? Can't I?
- Oh, like this?

984
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,220
- I can't? Okay.
- Yes, you can.

985
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,910
- Thank you, Hyuk.
- Don't mention it.

986
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,560
- Nice.
- He's so fast as always.

987
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,880
I'm really bad at this.

988
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,030
Oh, no. We're losing.

989
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,090
- What are you going to do?
- You go ahead.

990
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,060
- You can do it.
- That's good.

991
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,560
- Nice!
- Oh, my.

992
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,090
(Right then, K-Donnie Yen smashed
the ball unexpectedly!)

993
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,130
(He scored a point neatly.)

994
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,600
- Great job, Hyuk.
- That was good.

995
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,830
- That was really good.
- My gosh.

996
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,100
That was a Jit Kune Do kick.

997
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,710
- That was a Jit Kune Do kick.
- It was the taekgyeon style.

998
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,570
- A Jit Kune Do kick.
- That was great.

999
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,410
- He did a Jit Kune Do kick.
- Right.

1000
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:38,380
Big bro, you can do the same thing,
okay?

1001
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,290
- Like this? Okay.
- Yes. Okay.

1002
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,820
- I'll serve.
- Okay.

1003
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,530
- Good.
- Nice.

1004
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,560
- Receive it.
- Good.

1005
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,060
- Receive it.
- Good.

1006
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,200
(The ball hit the net.)

1007
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,860
Okay... Oh, no. It's okay.

1008
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,310
- It's okay.
- Okay.

1009
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,100
- By the way, Jong Kook.
- Yes?

1010
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,400
- You're so generous toward Donnie.
- He's generous, indeed.

1011
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,750
- If it was me, he would've yelled.
- You don't treat us like that.

1012
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,310
- It's his first time playing this.
- He's so strict toward us.

1013
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,020
- Okay. Big bro.
- Me?

1014
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,810
- Should I try again?
- Yes. You try it.

1015
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,960
I'll try it.

1016
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,810
- Okay!
- Let's do this.

1017
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,260
- Good.
- Okay. Let's go.

1018
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,860
- Mine.
- Okay.

1019
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,190
(The martial arts master
served neatly again.)

1020
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,730
- Oh, good.
- Okay.

1021
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,230
- That's good. Okay. Big bro!
- Receive it.

1022
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,190
- Okay.
- Head it. Big bro!

1023
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,070
- Big bro!
- Donnie.

1024
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,210
(He kicked in the air.)

1025
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,650
Why?

1026
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,670
- Big bro!
- Donnie.

1027
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,110
(Shrieking with disappointment)

1028
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,750
(He makes a mistake
when he's out of the serving zone.)

1029
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,820
- What a shame.
- Don't worry. It's okay.

1030
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,560
- Okay!
- Okay.

1031
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,360
- Nice.
- It's good.

1032
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,400
Let's let them win one point.

1033
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
- Let's give them one point.
- You're very strong.

1034
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,690
We should be more modest
and considerate of the other team.

1035
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,070
- Let's be considerate of them.
- He's being considerate of us.

1036
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,230
We're losing.

1037
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,210
- Our team is doing well.
- Kick it lightly.

1038
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,980
- I'll serve. Let's do this!
- Okay.

1039
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,610
Give So Min a chance to kick it.

1040
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,610
This is so much fun.

1041
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,480
- Okay. Mine.
- Go.

1042
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,980
- Big bro!
- How he calls Donnie is funny.

1043
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,570
- Okay!
- Good.

1044
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,540
- Suk Jin. Head it.
- Okay.

1045
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,360
- Okay. This is good.
- Okay.

1046
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,380
- Pass it. Big bro!
- Wait. Big bro!

1047
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,290
(Stepping backward)

1048
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,730
- Okay!
- That's good.

1049
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,290
(Donnie kicks the ball when he hears
"big bro" like Pavlov's dog.)

1050
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,090
- Okay.
- Mine! Big bro!

1051
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,090
(Jong Kook passes it
to Donnie again.)

1052
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,790
(The purgatory
of being called nonstop)

1053
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,570
- My gosh. Hey.
- Okay.

1054
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,610
- Oh, I made a mistake.
- Okay!

1055
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,610
(Home run)

1056
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,170
- Okay.
- Great.

1057
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,810
- Hey, Jong Kook.
- Okay. He's good at this, right?

1058
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,670
- You keep passing the ball...
- He's good at this, right?

1059
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,750
You pass the ball to him every time.

1060
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,750
- He's our hitter.
- You want to see him kick the ball.

1061
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,150
- I'm under a lot of pressure now.
- Okay.

1062
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,380
(He didn't feel this much pressure
even in Hollywood.)

1063
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,880
But it's really good
that you pass the ball to him.

1064
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,560
- No pressure.
- No pressure? Okay.

1065
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,960
- Donnie is very good at this.
- Indeed.

1066
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,960
- Let's applaud him!
- He's really good at this.

1067
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,290
(Seok Sam serves this time
since Donnie feels pressured.)

1068
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,130
- Good.
- Haha.

1069
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,290
Okay.

1070
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,840
- Okay.
- You should kick it over the net.

1071
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,940
(He barely managed to save
the ball!)

1072
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,000
- Good job.
- Nice!

1073
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,900
- Big bro!
- "Big bro."

1074
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,500
(Again?)

1075
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,110
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, no.

1076
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,110
(Big bro failed to overcome
the pressure in the end.)

1077
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,670
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1078
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,420
- You should've saved it.
- You...

1079
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,380
- put too much pressure on him.
- I thought he'd kick it over.

1080
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,960
If he failed to kick it over,
you should've saved it.

1081
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,380
- Hey.
- I thought he'd kick it over.

1082
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,960
- Even so, you should've saved it.
- I'm sorry. I thought...

1083
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,460
(Are they fighting because of me?)

1084
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,820
You're putting too much pressure
on Donnie.

1085
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,670
- No, I'm not.
- Donnie must be feeling...

1086
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,960
- It's my fault. I made a mistake.
- I mean...

1087
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,290
- I was just saying...
- You're putting pressure on him.

1088
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,210
- He can make a mistake sometimes.
- Don't put pressure on him.

1089
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,670
You should've saved it
since he made a mistake.

1090
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,980
I thought he'd kick it over the net.
I'm really sorry.

1091
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,730
- This is his first time.
- All right. I just thought...

1092
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,500
- he would kick it over.
- Stop putting pressure on him.

1093
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,110
All right. Let's go.

1094
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,980
- All right. Let's go. That's good.
- Okay.

1095
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,340
- You'll receive it, right?
- That was really good.

1096
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,340
Suk Jin.

1097
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,920
- That's good. Head it.
- Good.

1098
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,860
Ji Hyo, head it. Hey, you brat!

1099
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,820
(She missed the ball.)

1100
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,460
- Hello.
- Was that drunken boxing?

1101
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,460
- Hello.
- Hi. You're very polite.

1102
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,630
- You should wait until it comes up.
- Why didn't you just pass it?

1103
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,020
You should've hit it
when it bounced back up.

1104
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,000
- Didn't I do that?
- No, you didn't.

1105
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,170
- You hit it when it was going over.
- Let's go.

1106
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,440
(Donnie serves again.)

1107
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,940
- Good. Nice.
- He serves really well.

1108
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,540
- Donnie...
- That's good. Okay!

1109
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,670
- Hey.
- Kick it over.

1110
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,770
- Okay!
- Okay.

1111
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,940
- Save it. Gosh.
- He cheated.

1112
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,880
(He hit the ball with his hand.)

1113
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,820
- Why would he use his hand?
- That's not allowed.

1114
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,290
- I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't use your hand.

1115
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,380
- Gosh, seriously.
- Why would he...

1116
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,540
He hit the ball with his hand.

1117
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,420
He told Donnie not to use his hand
earlier.

1118
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,880
- I'm sorry, everyone.
- He felt rushed.

1119
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,860
The rallies end too quickly.

1120
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,060
I'll do it. Okay. I'll serve.

1121
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,420
- He's good at it.
- He's good.

1122
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,770
- Donnie is good at kicking.
- Nice.

1123
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,290
- I'll do my best.
- Okay.

1124
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,730
Hit it.

1125
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,110
Oh, my.

1126
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,110
That worked.

1127
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,270
Oh, my.

1128
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,380
(Bowing)

1129
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,440
- Hyuk, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1130
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,840
- Hey, Hyuk.
- Nice!

1131
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,070
- Are you okay? Hyuk...
- Are you okay? Your face...

1132
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,110
That was good.

1133
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,590
(Proud)

1134
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,750
- Hyuk...
- That was good.

1135
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,190
- Give us the ball.
- Hyuk is bad at this too.

1136
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,360
(He laughed while saying,
"Hyuk is bad at this too.")

1137
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,130
I'm not that bad at this.

1138
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,570
It's just that it rarely shows
because of So Min.

1139
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,690
- But he makes small mistakes.
- Okay.

1140
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,590
- Let's begin.
- Okay. Let's go.

1141
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,000
- I should receive it.
- That was hilarious.

1142
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,170
We must win.

1143
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,730
- Go.
- Big bro.

1144
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,630
- Oh, my.
- That's sharp.

1145
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,000
(The low, straight serve)

1146
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,150
Right. That was sharp.

1147
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,980
- He got the hang of it.
- I see that he's a fast learner.

1148
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,520
Right. That was sharp.

1149
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
(Donnie got the hang of it.)

1150
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,610
I see that he's a fast learner.

1151
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,690
It seems that Donnie...

1152
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,060
Do you want to serve again?

1153
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,380
- No.
- Serve again, please.

1154
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,360
- I can only...
- Donnie got the hang of it.

1155
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,230
Right. We won't go easy on you.
Do you hear me?

1156
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,770
- Mine.
- Mine.

1157
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,570
- Mine.
- Mine.

1158
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,040
So Min, come here.

1159
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,440
- You know...
- Why...

1160
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,400
Why do you keep kicking the ball
toward us?

1161
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,770
- So Min.
- So Min.

1162
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,880
- Come over here for a second.
- Why would you do that?

1163
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,810
It's a little dark around here.

1164
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,670
- Where should I stand?
- So can you hold the light?

1165
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,070
(He suggests she should touch
the light instead of the ball.)

1166
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,110
- Okay?
- Okay. Good.

1167
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,750
Then I'll stand here for now.

1168
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,690
Stand right in front of the net...

1169
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,520
and kick the ball over the net.
It'll be easy.

1170
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,150
Let me cover the area behind you.

1171
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,090
I guess Hyuk realized
how bad I'm at this.

1172
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,590
- He told me not to move back.
- Right. Just stay...

1173
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,270
- in front of the net.
- He told me to stay here.

1174
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,500
It's our turn.

1175
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,070
I'll serve like Ip Man.

1176
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,270
Abyo!

1177
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,570
I'll serve like Ip Man. Abyo!

1178
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,150
- Oh, man.
- Hyuk.

1179
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,440
(Did he try to hit it
with his shoulder?)

1180
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,820
- Hyuk, what's the matter?
- What was that?

1181
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,520
- What was that?
- Why did you do that?

1182
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,020
- I tried to use my shoulder.
- Why did you move your head...

1183
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,690
- like this? What was that?
- I'm sorry.

1184
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,960
Gosh, seriously.

1185
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,230
- Hey, what will you do?
- So Min. Okay!

1186
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,060
- Okay!
- So Min, come here.

1187
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,770
Good. Okay!

1188
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,960
(As So Min keeps doing a bad job...)

1189
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,070
Why did you use your hand?

1190
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,000
- Ji Hyo!
- Okay!

1191
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,190
- Okay.
- Good.

1192
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,310
Come on, Suk Jin.

1193
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,230
- You hit it with your forehead.
- Okay.

1194
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,940
It was very difficult.

1195
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,380
- Okay.
- You need only one point to win.

1196
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,770
This is it.
We shouldn't let them win.

1197
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,190
Let's score another point.

1198
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,710
- Okay.
- Yes. Good. It's okay.

1199
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,480
Move to your right.
They only need one more point.

1200
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,420
- Suk Jin, move to your right. Yes.
- Okay.

1201
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,130
- Let's end the game.
- All right.

1202
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,360
- Okay.
- Okay.

1203
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,230
(Haha serves
while there's tension in the air.)

1204
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

1205
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,690
- It floated high.
- Big bro.

1206
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,900
- Hey.
- Okay.

1207
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,440
- Nice.
- Good.

1208
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,940
- Hey.
- Suk Jin, move. Oh, it's good.

1209
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,000
- Good. Great job.
- Okay.

1210
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,310
- Good. Great job. He's moving.
- Okay.

1211
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,980
- Okay!
- Good.

1212
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,610
- Great.
- Good.

1213
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,020
- Let's end it now. Let's win.
- Okay. Let's go.

1214
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,320
The score is 30 to 30.

1215
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,540
Both teams need only one point.

1216
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,090
- Is it a deuce?
- Only one point.

1217
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,540
- Or just 1 point...
- The 1st team to get 1 point wins.

1218
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,360
- Got it.
- We can't let them win.

1219
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,610
When any of the teams gets a point,
the game will end.

1220
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,290
Yes, it ends
when any of us gets a point.

1221
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,150
Let's win. Let's not let them win.

1222
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,250
(The last 1 point will determine
the result of the game.)

1223
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,460
- We need only one point.
- Good.

1224
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,630
That's easy, right?

1225
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,420
- Be careful. Move.
- It's coming.

1226
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,770
Okay! Mine!

1227
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,170
- Big bro!
- Go!

1228
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,070
- Okay!
- Mine!

1229
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,310
- Mine!
- Good job.

1230
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,770
- You did well.
- Mine!

1231
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,770
- Big bro!
- Okay.

1232
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,980
Go!

1233
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,250
- Okay!
- Great job!

1234
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,020
- Good. That was great.
- Mine.

1235
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,690
Big bro!

1236
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,610
- Go!
- That's great.

1237
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,690
Okay.

1238
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,860
- Big bro!
- Okay.

1239
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,380
(Flinching)

1240
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,400
Big bro.

1241
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,630
(Oh, no.)

1242
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,190
- It's okay.
- Okay.

1243
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,540
(Donnie couldn't overcome
the pressure in the end.)

1244
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,040
- We did it.
- Gosh. I'm so upset.

1245
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,110
(Team Jae Suk wins.)

1246
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,810
- Okay.
- Very good.

1247
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,900
It was the foot volleyball game
that I won for the first time...

1248
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,480
and where I touched the ball...

1249
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,650
- more times than ever before.
- Come here.

1250
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,750
Now, I'll tell you
how many swords you obtained...

1251
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,110
- through the preliminary mission...
- Yes.

1252
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,960
and the foot volleyball game
you played with Donnie.

1253
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,560
The person in the first place...

1254
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,150
who obtained 14 swords...

1255
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,920
- Who is it?
- is Hyuk.

1256
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,520
(Hyuk placed 1st.)

1257
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,570
(K-Donnie who won both games
placed 1st.)

1258
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,040
- Hyuk, you must be happy.
- Right. He came in first earlier.

1259
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,270
He placed first earlier.

1260
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,400
Hyuk got 14 swords.

1261
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,670
Haha got 12 swords.

1262
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,500
- Jong Kook got 11 swords.
- Yes.

1263
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,340
- And So Min got ten swords.
- Okay.

1264
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,270
- Ji Hyo and Jae Suk got nine.
- Okay.

1265
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,900
- Suk Jin got 6 swords.
- I got 6?

1266
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,270
- Yes.
- Okay. Got it.

1267
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,040
Now, Donnie will play
the Pirate Roulette Game.

1268
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,750
- He can choose any color he wants.
- Oh, I see.

1269
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,980
Oh, I choose it? I see.

1270
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
- All right.
- The member who chose the color...

1271
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
of the sword he uses
when it pops out...

1272
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,860
- will get the prize.
- Okay. I understand.

1273
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,920
(Donnie doesn't know
which member chose which color.)

1274
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,520
Shall I start? Okay.

1275
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,570
(What color will Donnie choose 1st?)

1276
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,040
- What color will he choose?
- I think I'm going to choose...

1277
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,270
Shall I start? Okay.

1278
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,730
I think I'm going to choose red...

1279
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,810
- because I like red color.
- Oh, I see. Okay.

1280
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:57,310
(He chose Hyuk's sword.)

1281
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,670
- Yes. Okay.
- Okay.

1282
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,070
- Any color you want.
- Hold it.

1283
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,380
- You can hold it. All right.
- Oh, I see.

1284
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,610
- What?
- All right.

1285
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,290
(The Pirate popped out
in his 1st attempt.)

1286
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,840
- No way. That's impossible.
- Really?

1287
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,920
(Hyuk beat the impossible odds...)

1288
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,650
(and was chosen at once.)

1289
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,790
- No way.
- What was that?

1290
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,560
- That's it.
- No. We should do it over again.

1291
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,690
- He got so lucky.
- He got lucky.

1292
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,900
This is like making a hole-in-one.

1293
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,960
- Congratulations. The winner...
- It rarely happens.

1294
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,860
- to receive Donnie's items...
- It's almost impossible. Amazing.

1295
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,270
is Hyuk who chose red.

1296
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,380
- It's really amazing.
- Oh, my.

1297
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,540
Hyuk, this is amazing.

1298
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,250
(Signed DVDs of the "Ip Man" series
and his book on martial arts)

1299
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,980
This is a great gift.

1300
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,670
(Signed DVDs of the "Ip Man" series
and his book on martial arts)

1301
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,480
This is the biography of Ip Man
that I wrote.

1302
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,690
The other one is my book on kung fu.

1303
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,090
That's awesome.

1304
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,820
- His gift found the right owner.
- Hyuk must be happy.

1305
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,560
- It found the right owner.
- Exactly.

1306
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:50,130
We prepared a small gift
for Donnie...

1307
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,130
- to thank him for coming here.
- Yes.

1308
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,420
What is that?

1309
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,290
What does it say?

1310
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,090
- It's your name.
- Oh, I see. Okay.

1311
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,040
- I wish you a happy new year.
- I wish you a happy new year.

1312
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,360
I wish you all a happy new year.

1313
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,380
(We thank Hyuk and Donnie for making
us laugh and fascinating us.)

1314
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,770
Hello.

1315
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,400
- Hello.
- Hi.

1316
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,940
- Hello.
- Hi.

1317
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,020
Hello.

1318
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,570
Gosh, it's cold.

1319
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,480
I heard we don't have to wear a mask
starting today.

1320
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,320
There's still a Christmas tree here.

1321
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,290
(The place is still filled with
winter vibes.)

1322
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,860
Okay. One... So Min, come here.

1323
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,560
- Come here.
- So Min, can you move aside?

1324
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,150
- Oh, okay. Hello.
- I mean...

1325
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,650
Seriously...

1326
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,090
(A frog interrupted Jae Suk
when he was going to slate.)

1327
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,520
One, two, three.

1328
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,690
(He made the frog move
and managed to slate.)

1329
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,500
I've never seen Mr. Kang Chan Hee
being so cold to me.

1330
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,230
You sounded so cold-hearted.

1331
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,840
You never talked to me like that.

1332
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,070
- It was understandable.
- You sounded so cold-hearted.

1333
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,670
Jong Kook, hurry up and come.

1334
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,610
- Okay.
- Hello.

1335
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,710
I must say, it's nice...

1336
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:45,920
to be here
since the air is so fresh here.

1337
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,040
- Hey.
- You're lying.

1338
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,650
- There's a Christmas tree here.
- It's so nice.

1339
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,150
- They haven't taken it down.
- Jong Kook.

1340
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,980
Why do you look smaller
in tight clothes?

1341
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,130
- This jacket is too small for me.
- Why is it too small for you?

1342
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,070
- It makes his body look smaller.
- That's not good.

1343
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,690
The T-shirt I'm wearing under it
is too small for me too.

1344
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:01,730
- Look. It's so short.
- Right. I can see that.

1345
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,070
- It's too small for me.
- Did you lose weight?

1346
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,070
- No, I gained so much weight.
- It looks nice though.

1347
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,400
- Pull it down like this.
- It looks okay, right?

1348
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,570
- Yes.
- Is this a sleeveless shirt?

1349
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:10,130
- I could wear it without pants.
- Exactly.

1350
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,000
- Like this.
- Yes.

1351
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,340
Jong Kook, didn't you wear
these pants last week?

1352
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,420
Yes, I did.

1353
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,040
- I've been wearing it every week.
- Hello.

1354
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,210
Hi, Ji Hyo.

1355
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,840
Hi, So Min.

1356
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,150
- Hello.
- Hi.

1357
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

1358
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,290
- Where's the elder?
- Where's Suk Jin?

1359
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,230
- Suk Jin?
- Yes.

1360
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,520
He's lying down.

1361
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,500
- He hasn't come yet.
- He's breathing.

1362
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,000
Is he not feeling well?

1363
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,230
Seok Sam!

1364
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,940
- Come on. Hurry up!
- Goodness.

1365
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,340
- Stay focused.
- My gosh.

1366
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,770
- Wait!
- Seok Sam.

1367
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,810
Why are they rushing me like that?
It's still early.

1368
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,040
He's wearing a nice hat.

1369
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,670
- It's because...
- Ji Seok Sam!

1370
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,210
his blood vessels might rupture
if he doesn't wear a winter hat.

1371
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,570
- Really?
- You mean, in his ears?

1372
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,750
- No, in his head.
- What are you talking about?

1373
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,110
It's common for seniors.

1374
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,980
That's why
my mother always wears a winter hat.

1375
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,090
- You're wearing one too.
- Yes.

1376
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,880
Stop lying. That's nonsense.

1377
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,690
- While staying in a warm place...
- A sudden temperature drop...

1378
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,920
- Haha is right about that.
- The blood vessels can rupture.

1379
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,060
- Is that true?
- That's why he's wearing the hat.

1380
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,020
- Seniors are more susceptible.
- He's wearing it as it's winter.

1381
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,790
- It can be dangerous.
- They die all of a sudden?

1382
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,000
Your glasses...

1383
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,340
Don't put your prescription glasses
on top of your hat.

1384
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,340
- Are those prescription glasses?
- Yes.

1385
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,170
- He wanted it to look stylish.
- Really?

1386
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,150
Don't put your prescription glasses
on top of your hat.

1387
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,440
I can't see letters.

1388
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,710
- He's here. Hello.
- Oh, my.

1389
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,380
- Hello, Suk Jin.
- Superstar Ji!

1390
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,710
- Sir, you're here.
- Hey.

1391
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,980
Don't call me that.
Why did you guys gather so early?

1392
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,060
- Sir, you're here.
- We had no choice.

1393
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,820
- He hit Jae Suk.
- Why did you gather so early?

1394
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,690
- His blood vessels could rupture.
- Jae Suk slited early.

1395
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,060
- Sorry?
- It's not "slite."

1396
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,270
- What do you mean by "slite?"
- It's "slate."

1397
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,670
- She's so funny.
- That was good.

1398
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,860
- Neck slice.
- Good job.

1399
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,960
- Neck slice!
- That was good.

1400
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,900
- Did you do that intentionally?
- She's a great entertainer.

1401
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,440
- She's amazing.
- Slite.

1402
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,960
Oh, look.

1403
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,880
- Jae Suk.
- Why?

1404
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,270
- I see you bought winter boots.
- Oh, right.

1405
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,270
(He bought a new pair of shoes
as winter came.)

1406
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,420
- You ruined my shoes last time.
- He must've been jealous of Haha.

1407
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,920
- It's from Hunter.
- Haha.

1408
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,380
- You wore my shoes last time.
- Haha, he must've been jealous.

1409
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,690
And you got yourself
a new pair of winter boots?

1410
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,960
- Exactly.
- He must've been jealous of Haha.

1411
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,210
You bought winter boots?

1412
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,750
- He must've been jealous.
- He bought similar boots.

1413
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,290
(The similarity is 95 percent.)

1414
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,900
- They're different from Haha's.
- Right. I can see the difference.

1415
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,920
- Right. They look different.
- They're different.

1416
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,460
Why are you wearing shoes
that are not warm today?

1417
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,840
- I forgot to bring them.
- Oh, no.

1418
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,130
- I feel bad.
- If he takes off his shoes,

1419
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,130
it's over.

1420
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,270
- Oh, no.
- He didn't bring them.

1421
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,500
- What are you talking about?
- He didn't bring warm shoes.

1422
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,110
- Hey.
- Why did you not bring them today?

1423
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,650
He was worried
that someone might take them.

1424
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,110
- That's why he left them at home.
- He was scared.

1425
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,650
I heard you wear them
when sleeping too.

1426
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,710
- "My shoes."
- You punk.

1427
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,210
- You look good in them.
- They're nice, aren't they?

1428
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,560
As expected, young ones
are not covering their ears.

1429
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,460
Older ones
are all covering their ears.

1430
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,320
- In case their blood vessels pop.
- Hey.

1431
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,420
In case their blood vessels pop.

1432
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,770
- Gosh.
- You're right.

1433
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,320
Suk Jin, you dressed up today.

1434
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,900
- What do you mean I dressed up?
- You're wearing long johns, right?

1435
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,460
- It's quite short.
- He's wearing long johns.

1436
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,570
- I'm not wearing long johns.
- No. Look.

1437
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,730
- You're wearing them.
- Hey.

1438
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,650
(Detective Jeon is on her way.)

1439
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,750
(The long johns squad
is questioning him.)

1440
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,250
Be gentle.

1441
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,750
- Be gentle.
- He's wearing long johns.

1442
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,520
- I'm wearing ones too.
- I'm not.

1443
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,590
- Hey.
- He is...

1444
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,460
- He's wearing ones.
- He's so weak.

1445
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,960
- Hey, long johns...
- I'm not wearing ones.

1446
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,650
He's so weak.

1447
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:13,980
Jae Suk,
are you wearing long johns?

1448
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,250
- No, I'm not.
- You're not?

1449
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,900
- Young ones don't wear long johns.
- Young ones don't wear them.

1450
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,320
- People in their 30s...
- Look. It's my skin.

1451
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,630
- Come on.
- It's skin.

1452
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,730
- He's young.
- That's unusual.

1453
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,540
It's not unusual.
I usually don't wear them.

1454
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,210
- I'm wearing ones.
- I'm wearing ones.

1455
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,540
- I'm wearing this too.
- You should wear them.

1456
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,540
- You're wearing them too.
- His are thin, though.

1457
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,000
- I'm wearing ones too.
- Jong Kook is sensitive to cold.

1458
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,110
- Yes. He should wear them.
- I'm sensitive to cold.

1459
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,380
It's cold.

1460
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,940
- We're so young.
- Yes.

1461
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,420
- Right?
- You have a muffler, but not me.

1462
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,820
- That's true.
- I'm just wearing gloves.

1463
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,520
- You're the youngest.
- Yes.

1464
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:42,610
For today.

1465
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,880
So Min, why? What are you doing?

1466
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,520
I'm going to tuck it back.
It's so cold.

1467
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,630
- Don't tuck it back.
- I'm cold.

1468
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:48,730
You said you weren't cold.

1469
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,750
Roll it up. Leave it like this.

1470
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,270
- She's young.
- You bragged.

1471
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:53,770
- You bragged. Leave it like this.
- Because she's young.

1472
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,090
It's cool.

1473
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,090
- Hurry and shut the clapperboard.
- Yes. Leave it like this.

1474
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,810
Because you bragged about it,
keep bragging about it.

1475
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,400
We're wearing them as we should,
but you're young.

1476
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,400
- So wear your pants like that.
- We're wearing them...

1477
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
because we're old.

1478
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,310
Since you're young,
you roll your pants up too.

1479
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,750
Roll them up.

1480
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,650
- Roll them up.
- You roll them up too.

1481
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,440
- Roll them up, you punk.
- Roll them up.

1482
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,420
What are you?

1483
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,590
- Oh, no.
- We...

1484
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:18,590
- Are they calves or thighs?
- Look at his thighs.

1485
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,980
Why do his thighs look like that?

1486
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,650
Jae Suk.

1487
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,020
- Are they calves or thighs?
- Oh, no.

1488
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,900
- Why?
- What's wrong with your thighs?

1489
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,630
Why? It's fine
as long as it was funny, right?

1490
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:28,730
- It was funny.
- But they were too...

1491
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,400
- Why? They're firm.
- They're like calves.

1492
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,000
- It was funny.
- Don't worry.

1493
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,310
His thighs are as big as his calves.

1494
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,940
How is it possible?

1495
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,900
(The leader of team long johns
is laughing so hard.)

1496
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,670
His thighs are as big as my calves.

1497
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,810
His legs are like toothpicks.

1498
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,040
- Why?
- How can he walk with those?

1499
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,040
- Isn't it okay?
- I'm sad.

1500
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,710
- I'm sad.
- Don't worry.

1501
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,380
Don't be sad. I'm healthy.

1502
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,610
- But he's the healthiest.
- He's healthy.

1503
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,420
- I'm the healthiest.
- He's the healthiest.

1504
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,520
- This is nice.
- Anyway, what are we doing today?

1505
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,020
- Where are we, by the way?
- Hongcheon.

1506
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,250
Is it Hongcheon?

1507
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,730
You came a long way
to Gangwon Province.

1508
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,440
You're going to enjoy
a winter retreat...

1509
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,500
in Gangwon Province,
the snow paradise.

1510
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,500
Retreat sounds nice.

1511
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,540
Winter this year
feels like real winter.

1512
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,730
- It's real winter. It snowed a lot.
- Right?

1513
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,630
The snow was beautiful.
It was like a picture on the way here.

1514
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,540
- Today...
- It suddenly became "Frozen."

1515
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,940
The rules for precious retreat time
are simple.

1516
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,020
You will do what we planned.

1517
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,090
- What you planned?
- Yes.

1518
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,210
No matter
how much you're enjoying it,

1519
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,750
you need to stop what you're doing
when the time comes...

1520
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,460
to move on to the next one.

1521
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,920
- What is it?
- It's the worst.

1522
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,630
- I hate it the most.
- Like when the meal time is over,

1523
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,500
- stop eating immediately...
- We can't eat?

1524
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,730
- to do the next plan.
- That's not right.

1525
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,500
Will we get enough time?

1526
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,130
- Yes.
- Yes?

1527
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,270
- Okay.
- We should follow their plans?

1528
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:41,210
I hated having daily schedules
for vacations.

1529
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,570
Then let me reveal
the schedule for the retreat.

1530
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,310
- Okay.
- Are there many things to do?

1531
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,750
- We should go grocery shopping.
- It's packed.

1532
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,210
- We're taking a nap?
- "Opening and grocery shopping."

1533
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,320
(Opening and grocery shopping,
moving, lunch, nap, recreation)

1534
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,110
- "Opening and grocery shopping."
- Napping sounds good.

1535
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,320
- Napping is good.
- Whose idea was it?

1536
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,690
- That's amazing.
- Dried pollack kimchi sujebi,

1537
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,920
dried pollack,
and Korean sand lance?

1538
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,520
- Let's have Korean sand lances.
- It's good.

1539
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,400
My father eats them a lot.

1540
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
(Running Man retreat schedule:
Lunch from 10:30 a.m. to 12 p.m.)

1541
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,500
(All sorts of winter delicacies
are here.)

1542
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,000
(Dried pollack sujebi, grilled dried
pollack, and Korean sand lance)

1543
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,310
- For lunch,
- Thin one.

1544
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:14,310
- should we have this?
- Yes.

1545
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,380
Including grilled dried pollack
and Korean sand lance?

1546
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,570
- You should grill them.
- Do we have to eat them?

1547
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:21,000
Not long ago,
I saw grilled Korean sand lance...

1548
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,040
- on "Hometown Report."
- It's delicious.

1549
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,150
- It looked delicious.
- Yes.

1550
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,380
- It's good.
- The fish is as big as this.

1551
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,110
- Grilling Korean sand lances.
- They're thin.

1552
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:30,290
- Gangwon Province is famous...
- We'll finish the food quickly.

1553
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,290
for many kinds of food,

1554
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,980
- but dried pollacks are...
- That's right.

1555
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,360
- Grilled dried pollacks are good.
- Grilling it over a briquette fire.

1556
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,130
- On the gridiron.
- Over a briquette fire.

1557
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,500
Dried pollack kimchi sujebi
sounds amazing.

1558
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,570
- It's going to be so good.
- With sujebi...

1559
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,840
We're going to have dried pollack
kimchi sujebi,

1560
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,040
but it's going to become
dried pollack kimchi ramyeon.

1561
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,570
- I'm right.
- They're dumbfounded.

1562
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,310
- Ramyeon and sujebi are...
- Can't you see "sujebi" here?

1563
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,940
- Without eating...
- There must be ramyeon noodles.

1564
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,980
- Hey.
- Anyway, the broth is...

1565
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,840
The broth is the same.

1566
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,150
- Ramyeon...
- We'll take a nap without eating.

1567
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,650
Right. We'll take a nap
without eating.

1568
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,650
For sure.

1569
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,650
Anyway,
I'm excited about this today.

1570
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,710
But can we eat within this time?

1571
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,090
- Thirty... What?
- Oh, right. Can we do it?

1572
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,190
- The time limit looks fine.
- Can we cook and all?

1573
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,290
- Are we cooking?
- Do we have to cook?

1574
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,290
We should cook.

1575
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:09,900
- We're doing it?
- That's why. Is it possible?

1576
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,670
It took three hours to eat
last time.

1577
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,630
- But you don't need to make a fire.
- We have to cook?

1578
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,040
- What did you say?
- You don't have to make a fire.

1579
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,670
- Do we have a gas stove?
- We should make a fire here.

1580
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,460
- Don't do that.
- We should make a fire.

1581
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,670
- If we make a fire, we can't do it.
- We should make a fire.

1582
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,400
- If we make a fire, we can't do it.
- Making a fire...

1583
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,480
- Don't do it.
- Right.

1584
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,000
We were going to make a fire for you.
Will you make it yourself?

1585
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,500
- Let's make a fire.
- We should do it ourselves.

1586
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,380
Then we need one more hour for each.

1587
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,110
- He's a fire evangelist.
- I mean...

1588
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:35,190
Let's cook and make a fire
separately.

1589
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,090
- Yes. We need to make a fire.
- Cook on a stove. I'll make a fire.

1590
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,230
- It's his favorite thing.
- Yes. It's so warm.

1591
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,650
- Playing with fire.
- Yes.

1592
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,920
So it's grilled dried pollack
and Korean sand lance.

1593
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,130
Wait. What time is it now?

1594
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,630
- We should hurry up.
- It's nine.

1595
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,840
- We should go grocery shopping now.
- We should go.

1596
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,400
- Let's go.
- The first one is grocery shopping.

1597
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,210
You saw the menu earlier.

1598
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,630
- We should buy groceries too?
- You should get the ingredients...

1599
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,840
that suit the winter trip
to Gangwon Province.

1600
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,650
It's only 9:07 a.m.

1601
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:02,210
We did a research
and set the appropriate price.

1602
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,750
- How much is it?
- How much is it?

1603
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,020
It's 65 dollars.

1604
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,920
- Come on. That's not enough.
- What?

1605
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,920
Things are expensive these days.

1606
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,320
- How many do you think we are?
- How much is a dried pollock?

1607
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,630
We'll give you dried pollacks.

1608
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,090
- Do you have them?
- There will be dried pollacks.

1609
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,460
- You should just marinate it.
- How about Korean sand lances?

1610
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,230
- We got sauce too.
- We need to get snacks too.

1611
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,230
- But...
- We'll just need...

1612
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,270
the main ingredients.

1613
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:22,540
Do we have to get radish
and onions too?

1614
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,270
This is not enough money.

1615
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,710
We can't have chapsal donut then?

1616
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,540
If you leave a little bit of money,
you can have them. It's so good.

1617
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,440
- It must be good.
- What?

1618
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,670
- You must have them at a market.
- I can see it right in front of me.

1619
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:35,480
- Did you eat it already?
- Eat what?

1620
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,670
- She had it already.
- She had it already.

1621
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,520
- She had donuts.
- She already had them.

1622
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,440
- Twisted donuts.
- Let's have them later.

1623
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,860
You can buy any groceries
with a budget of 65 dollars.

1624
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,560
- Let's go to the market.
- Okay.

1625
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:47,750
- Let's do grocery shopping.
- It's cold.

1626
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:48,820
Let's go. Where is it?

1627
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,290
The central market?

1628
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,500
- Let's have twisted donuts first.
- Let's have twisted donuts first.

1629
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,500
- Come here.
- No, Suk Jin.

1630
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,840
We should buy the ingredients first
and get snacks later.

1631
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,230
No. Where do they have
twisted donuts?

1632
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,540
Where did Jae Suk go?

1633
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,540
"Potatoes, zucchini, red chilies,
scallion, onion, radish,"

1634
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,040
- "and flour."
- We can take some out.

1635
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,770
- No. We need potatoes.
- We need potatoes.

1636
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:05,770
- We should put potatoes in.
- We need zucchini too.

1637
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,040
- Zucchini and potatoes.
- Zucchini.

1638
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,940
- Let's just take out red chilies.
- Yes. Take them out.

1639
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,290
Anyway, let's get twisted donuts
when we have money left.

1640
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,650
- Yes. We'll have some left.
- We don't need kelp...

1641
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,020
when we have anchovies.

1642
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,650
We just need anchovies for broth.
Okay.

1643
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:18,130
- Let's just get the ones for broth.
- Yes.

1644
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,130
You can make broth
with dried pollacks.

1645
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,130
Where is Jae Suk?

1646
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:23,460
- No. They sell...
- Yes. Buy that one.

1647
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,570
- small tablets for broth.
- But...

1648
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:26,730
- Do they have them here?
- Let's get that.

1649
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,290
- The tablets?
- Do they have them here?

1650
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:29,670
- You know them too.
- Yes. That one.

1651
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,130
Do you know what Jae Suk is doing?

1652
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,130
What is he doing?

1653
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,170
- He's wearing long johns.
- Really?

1654
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,880
It's cold.

1655
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,770
Gangwon Province
is indeed Gangwon Province.

1656
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,900
Really?

1657
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,520
You have a runny nose.

1658
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,750
- It's colder than I thought.
- It's cold here.

1659
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,940
- Jae Suk.
- Let's go. Where is he?

1660
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,250
- Let's have twisted donuts first.
- Yes.

1661
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,710
- No. After getting other things.
- Let's have a look at least.

1662
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,090
- It's fine. Let's get donuts.
- Get the ingredients first.

1663
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,520
We'll have enough money left
for sure.

1664
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,650
- Fine. Go ahead.
- We'll have enough money left.

1665
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,900
- Let's get twisted donuts.
- Yes. Let's just have one.

1666
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,570
Just one for each. Come here.

1667
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,360
So Min, come here.
She has the money.

1668
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,940
- She has the money. Let's go.
- I have the money.

1669
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,730
I have the money.
What's the use of going there?

1670
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,670
She has the money. Come here.

1671
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,480
- Hey! Come here.
- Come on.

1672
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,650
- Come with us.
- Hurry up. The money is here.

1673
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,480
Come here. Gosh.

1674
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,520
- Come here.
- When did you ever...

1675
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,210
We should eat it. Se Chan!

1676
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,020
Then... Hey.

1677
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,230
- Just let us slide.
- Can you get just one for us?

1678
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,480
(Asking the cameraman to get donuts)

1679
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,730
I don't have money.

1680
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,000
(She failed to get donuts from him.)

1681
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,090
Or can we pay you later
when we come back?

1682
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,520
They will have money left.

1683
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,570
- They will for sure.
- What if they don't?

1684
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,000
If not, we'll go to jail.

1685
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,460
I like this.

1686
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,500
- We'll pay when we come back later.
- Okay.

1687
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,480
- We'll pay you for sure.
- This one.

1688
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,730
- I'll get this one too.
- Do you want it?

1689
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,770
- Yes. I'll have this one too.
- You have this too.

1690
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,770
- Yes.
- I'm not eating now.

1691
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:48,920
- Why not?
- If they have money left,

1692
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,020
I'll get the two-dollar one.

1693
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,320
- That looks better.
- Eat now.

1694
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,750
- No. Not now.
- Let's eat together.

1695
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,380
Eat.

1696
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,710
- I'm not eating.
- Let's eat together.

1697
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:57,710
Let's eat together quickly.

1698
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,730
Why do you want
to make me an accomplice?

1699
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,730
Eat it quickly.

1700
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,000
I'll have the vegetable one too.

1701
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,320
I'll have the vegetable one too.
Eat. It's fine.

1702
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,090
- I'll get scolded.
- This is fun, though.

1703
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,270
- No, I mean...
- We should have snacks...

1704
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:09,630
- at a market.
- In case we can't pay.

1705
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,270
- How much are these already?
- We can pay. What are you saying?

1706
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,360
We can pay it back. This is so good.

1707
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,940
(The main culprits
are eating first.)

1708
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,110
- Thank you.
- How did you make it so delicious?

1709
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,250
Thank you.

1710
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,340
How is it?

1711
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,940
We'll make sure to pay
when we come back later.

1712
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,210
- Okay.
- How is it?

1713
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:26,250
(All their worries about money
disappear after having a bite.)

1714
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,190
- What's this?
- It's good.

1715
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,190
(All their worries about money
disappear after having a bite.)

1716
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,360
- It's delicious, ma'am.
- I'm not doing this for the camera.

1717
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,250
- It's so chewy. What is it?
- Bye.

1718
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,460
It's glutinous rice.

1719
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:39,670
- No way.
- How can it taste like this?

1720
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:42,000
- There isn't much oil.
- It's crispy outside, moist inside.

1721
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,190
It's so clean.

1722
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,310
- I should have one more.
- Do you want to have one more?

1723
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,670
Haha, no. We can't pay it back.

1724
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,210
- What if we don't have money?
- We will pay it back.

1725
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,310
- Anyway...
- We...

1726
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,270
- can take out some ingredients.
- I don't think we'll leave some.

1727
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,480
We can take out some ingredients.
Was it 65 dollars?

1728
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,380
Yes. This one is really good too.

1729
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,420
Jae Suk is coming.

1730
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:02,880
- Let's make him eat one.
- Let's make him eat one.

1731
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,060
- Feed him.
- Let's make him eat.

1732
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,560
(They're going to make
another accomplice.)

1733
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,920
We need many accomplices.

1734
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,920
Jae Suk.

1735
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,460
- Tell him to eat it.
- Jae Suk!

1736
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,190
Don't tell him the details.

1737
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,090
Have some of this. It's crazy.

1738
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:15,790
It's not oily.

1739
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,000
- Really?
- Eat one.

1740
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,110
- Could you give us...
- It's unbelievable.

1741
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,210
- one more chapsal donut?
- Can we have one more?

1742
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,860
- Hello.
- Chapsal donut.

1743
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,070
It's really delicious.

1744
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:23,070
Try it.

1745
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:25,150
(One chapsal donut is ready
even before they ordered it.)

1746
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,270
- This is the best.
- Try it.

1747
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,510
(Jae Suk hesitates.)

1748
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,660
- But I want to eat this more.
- Then eat that one.

1749
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,990
This is tastier, Jae Suk.

1750
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,280
- You don't need to sprinkle that.
- On just one of them.

1751
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,300
- Put it on only one. Leave the two.
- Yes. Put it on the other two.

1752
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,160
- I'll give you one extra.
- Goodness.

1753
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,590
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1754
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:50,860
- Then the total is...
- Take a bite, Jae Suk.

1755
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,990
How much is it?

1756
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,860
- Okay.
- It's done.

1757
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,510
Is it tasty?

1758
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,340
(They can now fully enjoy.)

1759
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,910
- Have one.
- It's really soft.

1760
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,910
(He joins the twisted donut
eating show not knowing the reason.)

1761
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:04,720
- This makes no sense.
- It's really delicious, right?

1762
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,820
It's very tasty.

1763
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:09,410
Why are they there
when the money is here?

1764
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:11,140
Let them just watch.

1765
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,660
- It's bigger than I thought.
- Yes.

1766
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,630
- I've not been to a market lately.
- The market.

1767
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,860
I wonder what they have.

1768
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:19,160
It looks great.

1769
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,860
It looks delicious.

1770
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,990
(They see a display
of various food.)

1771
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,320
I love markets like this.

1772
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,890
This is nice.
This is how the market looks like.

1773
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,890
What do we need to buy?

1774
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:29,860
We need things
like zucchini, red pepper,

1775
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,780
green onion, onion, and radish.

1776
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,780
- We first have to go to a store.
- That's right.

1777
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,570
- A store will have them.
- Or...

1778
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:38,220
you can buy broth at the kalguksu
restaurant here.

1779
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,970
The sujebi there.

1780
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,280
- What's already made?
- Yes.

1781
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,010
- Can we just buy a little?
- It would be nice, right?

1782
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,760
They'd have the dough
you use for kalguksu.

1783
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,430
The someorigukbap here looks good.

1784
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,390
It must be delicious.

1785
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:53,260
- I wish we could just eat it.
- Yes.

1786
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,200
Hold on. Where do we have to go?

1787
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:56,800
First,

1788
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,390
we have to go to a store.

1789
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:00,240
Excuse me, where can I find...

1790
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,860
- green onions? Over this side?
- Over there.

1791
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,470
Go to that store.

1792
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,110
The store here. I see.

1793
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,280
Thank you.

1794
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,280
That's where we can go.

1795
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,800
- Then...
- It's a big one.

1796
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,280
how much of them do we buy?

1797
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,720
- Just a little bit.
- One each.

1798
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,320
- Yes. One each.
- One onion, one radish.

1799
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,840
- Hello.
- Yes. Hello.

1800
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,890
- Hello.
- Yes, welcome.

1801
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,860
Hello.

1802
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,430
(A small store where products
don't have price tags)

1803
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,860
- Welcome.
- We need one onion, one radish...

1804
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,700
We don't need that many onions.

1805
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,860
How much is this?

1806
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,390
- It's 4.5 dollars.
- It's 4.5 dollars?

1807
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:32,470
- Goodness.
- Do you not sell them separately?

1808
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,340
- We just need one onion.
- Just one?

1809
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,240
- Yes.
- Just one.

1810
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,410
- Good.
- Oh, dear.

1811
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,740
Are you giving us two?

1812
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,510
- What's happening?
- He gave us two onions.

1813
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,640
- Two onions?
- They have zucchini.

1814
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,740
- We need one.
- They sell zucchini separately.

1815
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,820
- Could we have one green onion?
- One zucchini...

1816
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,550
We need one green onion.

1817
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:50,640
- Do you have potatoes?
- Potatoes?

1818
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,890
How...

1819
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,160
do you sell the potatoes?

1820
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,490
- It's 3.5 dollars per kilo.
- Per kilo?

1821
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,490
That's about seven potatoes.

1822
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,550
- Okay. Give us a kilo, then.
- Great.

1823
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,160
Can we have the smallest radish?

1824
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,590
(They're shopping
while trying to save money.)

1825
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:04,630
- That's big.
- The radish is huge.

1826
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,740
- It looks good.
- Give us a small one.

1827
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,140
This is too big.

1828
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,910
- How much is this?
- It's two dollars.

1829
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:10,410
- Two dollars? That's good.
- Let's buy it.

1830
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,780
Do you have anchovies to make broth?

1831
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,380
- We sell that in boxes, though.
- In boxes?

1832
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,470
- You do?
- No, thanks.

1833
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,550
- Then...
- What do we do?

59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,500
Do you have the extract for broth?

1834
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,320
- Like those in a tea bag.
- You don't?

1835
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,610
We don't sell those here.

1836
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,820
You have to go to a place like SSG.

1837
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,450
- Somewhere in Cheongdam.
- You should buy it from SSG.

1838
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,160
- That's right.
- You only need a few, right?

1839
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,320
- That's right.
- Yes.

1840
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,660
Do you sell it in small portions
too?

1841
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,260
- Well...
- Did I put the whole amount before?

1842
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,570
We'll die if you put all those.

1843
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,070
- It will become bitter.
- You put so much.

1844
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,610
It tasted like the ocean in Busan.

1845
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:48,070
(She brewed poison using anchovies
that can make soup for a month.)

1846
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,380
- We were in Busan Port.
- Sujebi?

1847
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:53,910
- We'll make for six people.
- That's enough.

1848
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,110
Would this be enough?

1849
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,780
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1850
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,180
Thank you.

1851
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,550
- Then...
- We bought everything.

1852
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,090
Zucchini, no red pepper,
green onion, onion, radish,

1853
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,220
flour, anchovies. That's all.

1854
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,430
- Is that all?
- Yes.

1855
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,990
- Could you tell us the price?
- Yes.

1856
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:11,530
This is one dollar.

1857
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,030
Thank you.

1858
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,260
It's 13.3 dollars.

1859
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:16,240
(It's 13.3 dollars in total?)

1860
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,700
Thank you.

1861
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,340
Did you calculate everything?

1862
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,300
Here's 14 dollars.

1863
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,050
Just give me 13 dollars.

1864
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,880
(Just give me 13 dollars.)

1865
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:29,110
You're giving us more discount?

1866
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:30,490
(He rounded down the amount.)

1867
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,320
- You're so caring.
- Thank you.

1868
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,720
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1869
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,280
Shall we go out this way?

1870
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,450
- The one with red beans is good.
- It's delicious.

1871
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:40,950
- It's really delicious,
- The one with red beans is better.

1872
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,570
- What do you like more?
- This one is better, right?

1873
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:45,800
- We don't wear masks now.
- It's so nice without them.

1874
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,700
- I didn't know it started today.
- But you still have to wear them.

1875
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,760
- In hospitals or pharmacies.
- Yes.

1876
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,140
- Also in public...
- Jae Suk.

1877
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,930
It's someorigukbap.

1878
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,070
It would be nice if we just ate
from there.

1879
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:57,050
How delicious would it be?

1880
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,880
Gukbap would be nice
to have right now.

1881
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,070
- Shall we just have a look?
- Let's have a look.

1882
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,140
- Let's check how much it is.
- Let's just eat it.

1883
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,180
Can we just put it on the tab again?

1884
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,390
- Let's eat it.
- Let's put it on the tab.

1885
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,590
(Let's put it on the tab.)

1886
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,490
- Are they serving right now?
- Let's go.

1887
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

1888
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,530
- Look at that.
- The food here...

1889
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:11,950
- is nice, right?
- It looks delicious.

1890
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,950
- It looks amazing.
- How much is it?

1891
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:15,470
- It's 8 dollars.
- It's 8 dollars?

1892
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,890
We can't share one bowl, right?

1893
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:18,390
Our money. Hold on.

1894
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,240
- Guys!
- Here's Korean sand lance.

1895
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,010
- What is it? Korean sand lance?
- It's Korean sand lance.

1896
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,010
- Korean sand lance?
- This is Korean sand lance, right?

1897
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,470
- How much is Korean sand lance?
- That one?

1898
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:27,680
It's six dollars per line.

1899
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,450
- Give us one line.
- That's right.

1900
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:30,570
How nice.

1901
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:31,740
(They're glad since it's cheaper
than what they expected.)

1902
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,970
- Do we wash it before eating?
- You can just eat it as is.

1903
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:36,340
- We can just have it?
- Do we cook it without salting it?

1904
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,990
- You can have it salted too.
- I see.

1905
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:40,610
With this amount of money,

1906
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:42,320
we could eat someorigukbap too.

1907
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:44,320
We have enough.
Let's use this money...

1908
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,700
and eat a bowl of someorigukbap.

1909
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,300
Yes. We've been too sensitive.

1910
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Be blessed.

1911
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,490
- Happy new year.
- Thank you.

1912
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,470
- We'll enjoy it.
- Thank you.

1913
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:53,970
- Yes. Happy new year.
- Thank you.

1914
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:56,510
- We bought Korean sand lance too.
- Yes.

1915
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:57,740
We wouldn't need scallions,
would we?

1916
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:59,680
We need to buy kimchi.

1917
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,700
What are they doing?

1918
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,840
- They're again...
- What are you doing?

1919
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,640
How are you eating
when you don't have money?

1920
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,820
Jong Kook,

1921
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:07,470
- the owner of this restaurant...
- Yes.

1922
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,720
- wanted to give us warm soup.
- But...

1923
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,320
How would you eat that
when you don't have money?

1924
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,260
We bought almost everything,

1925
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,320
- and there's still some left.
- We have some money left.

1926
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,430
How much is left?

1927
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:18,130
- Hello. We still have money.
- How much is left?

1928
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:19,820
Let's eat someorigukbap.

1929
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,930
- I also wanted to eat that.
- Good.

1930
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:23,220
Jae Suk.

1931
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,530
Shall we eat a bowl of gukbap?

1932
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,760
I think we can eat.

1933
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,200
- But it will take time.
- That's right.

1934
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,360
You know,

1935
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,300
if the rice cake place opens now,

1936
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,740
and you eat the freshly made
garaetteok...

1937
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,610
- It's rice cake.
- Sirutteok.

1938
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,880
Look at this. It's sirutteok.

1939
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,070
- It looks nice.
- Jae Suk,

1940
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,990
let's eat this.

1941
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,280
- They have pancakes too.
- He sold them in small portions.

1942
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,320
(They're forgetting the real reason
why they came to the market...)

1943
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,990
We're going to make lunch now.

1944
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,660
Why are you trying to eat now?

1945
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,360
Our stomachs should be warm
in order for us to work.

1946
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,800
Also, come here.

1947
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,050
From one point,

1948
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,720
you started liking these places
more than Hongdae.

1949
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,860
I also hold my hand at the back
when I walk.

1950
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,430
I also...

1951
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:01,660
- did that starting one day.
- It's too...

1952
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,360
- It's comfortable, right?
- I started holding it behind.

1953
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,760
- It's so good.
- You do that...

1954
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,880
- to keep balance.
- That's right.

1955
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,110
Let's buy snacks on our way.

1956
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,010
Thank you for the tea.
This looks great.

1957
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:14,410
- Thank you.
- We enjoyed it.

1958
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:16,320
- This...
- It's really cheap.

1959
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:18,550
- Hello.
- Those are pancakes.

1960
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:20,260
- Hello.
- Hello.

1961
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,130
- How welcoming.
- What pancake is that?

1962
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,890
- It looks nice. It's buckwheat.
- She's waving at us.

1963
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,360
- Buckwheat pancakes?
- This must be bukkumi.

1964
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,550
- Hello.
- Bukkumi?

1965
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:28,760
These are bukkumi.

1966
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,820
- This looks good.
- Let's eat.

1967
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:32,390
Bukku

1968
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,860
Hello.

1969
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,410
Is this sorghum bukkumi?

1970
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,910
- No. These are pancakes.
- Buckwheat pancakes.

1971
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,800
- Buckwheat pancakes?
- Buckwheat pancakes.

1972
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:41,640
It's buckwheat.

1973
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,570
(Pancakes with sliced radish
wrapped with buckwheat dough)

1974
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:45,220
It's early morning still.

1975
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,910
- This is...
- This looks good.

1976
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,110
It looks tasty.

1977
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,680
- Buckwheat pancakes.
- Pancakes?

1978
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,110
- Buckwheat pancakes?
- Buckwheat pancakes.

1979
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:54,510
- Hello.
- These are cut.

1980
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,490
- No, cooked.
- You can eat it like that too.

1981
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:57,890
- Right now?
- Would you like some?

1982
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,700
- How much is it?
- How much is one?

1983
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,700
- Just one.
- It's two dollars.

1984
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,760
- Let's eat one then.
- Let's use two dollars.

1985
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,970
- We have two dollars.
- Could you cut it for us?

1986
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:04,990
Let's eat the amount
for two dollars.

1987
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:06,470
- Yes. Two dollars.
- Could you cut it?

1988
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,660
- Just two dollars.
- Let's get it for two dollars.

1989
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,840
Since you're eight people,
I'll give you one extra.

1990
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,470
- No, don't do that.
- You don't need to.

1991
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:12,800
Please cut this one
into small pieces.

1992
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,300
- We don't have that much.
- How much do we have?

1993
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,640
We'll just eat one.

1994
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,280
- It was made just now.
- Yes.

1995
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,300
- Yes.
- That's right.

1996
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,950
We should eat this one.

1997
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,380
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1998
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,160
- Could you make it eight pieces?
- It's fine.

1999
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,890
- No.
- Don't do that.

2000
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,720
- We'll play a game to eat that.
- It's too much.

2001
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,950
- It's a rule.
- It's a rule.

2002
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,490
- Don't. It's a rule.
- It's a rule.

2003
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,990
Gosh.

2004
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:34,220
We'll pay four dollars.

2005
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:35,630
(They paid four dollars.)

2006
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:36,990
Give her four dollars.

2007
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,470
What should we eat it with?

2008
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:41,200
You can put it in our mouths.

2009
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,410
- You can feed us.
- I'll put it in your mouth.

2010
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,530
- This is warm.
- Get in line.

2011
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:46,200
- Go behind.
- Stand in line.

2012
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,430
Stand in line.

2013
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,410
This is warm.

2014
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,880
It's delicious.

2015
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,720
- It's tasty.
- Is it good?

2016
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,780
- It's delicious?
- Yes. It's good.

2017
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,610
(Laughing)

2018
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,950
- It's delicious.
- This is it.

2019
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:03,990
It's really good.

2020
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,450
Thank you.

2021
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:07,160
(The food train is operating well.)

2022
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,890
What's in it? It's so delicious.

2023
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:10,720
It's her second turn.

2024
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,720
It's tasty.

2025
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,890
(She got caught trying to eat it
the second time.)

2026
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:15,700
- Would you like more?
- No.

2027
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,760
(The mother bird
takes a bite belatedly.)

2028
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,930
- It's tasty.
- You should eat another one.

2029
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,880
It's tasty.

2030
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,180
(The last piece goes
to the cameraman.)

2031
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,450
- Thank you for the food.
- Okay.

2032
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:25,280

2033
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:26,910

2034
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:28,510
- Okay.

2035
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,680
- We will get going.
- Thank you. Bless you.

2036
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,720
Bless you.

2037
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,860
Ji Hyo, we need to buy kimchi.

2038
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,680
- Hello.
- Se Chan, there are oysters.

2039
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,660
It's until 10 a.m., right?

2040
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,130
Stop glancing around.

2041
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,860
We need to keep our eyes ahead
and focus on our tasks.

2042
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,860
Yes. Keep your eyes ahead.

2043
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:43,970
We just need kimchi.

2044
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:45,260
- Ma'am.
- Hello.

2045
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,470
- We need to get kimchi.
- It's a kimchi place.

2046
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,470
Let's get kimchi here.

2047
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,360
We need ripe kimchi.

2048
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,970
I think we can buy this.

2049
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:52,880
- Would this one be nice?
- Yes.

2050
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,610
We will add it to sujebi.

2051
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:55,610
That would be nice.

2052
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:58,010
- Let's buy it.
- This one.

2053
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:01,070
- There are different types...
- We can taste it.

2054
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:02,510
of kimchi.

2055
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,280
- Would it be okay to taste it?
- Of course.

2056
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,490
Thank you.

2057
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,950
I am full already.

2058
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:10,950
(It would be strange
if they weren't full.)

2059
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:13,220
Back in the day,
my aunt had a store...

2060
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,220
- in a market.
- I see.

2061
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,260
Whenever I was on a break,

2062
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,740
I spent time there.

2063
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,910
I sat in the room with a blanket.

2064
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,970
It was cold.

2065
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:28,640
Jae Suk.

2066
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,240
(Laughing)

2067
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,180
- Jae Suk.
- Come and eat this.

2068
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:33,470
- Jae Suk.
- It's so tasty.

2069
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:34,740
It would be tasty with rice.

2070
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,820
Look at the color.
You can tell that it's tasty.

2071
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,010
It's nice.

2072
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:40,890
It's so tasty.
It would be tasty with rice.

2073
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,180
- Let's eat it with ramyeon.
- Let's eat it with ramyeon.

2074
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:45,430
It would be amazing with ramyeon.

2075
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:47,990
- It's so refreshing.
- Let's eat it with ramyeon.

2076
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:50,300
- We need to cook ramyeon.
- If we eat it with ramyeon...

2077
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:52,740
- It's so tasty. Try it.
- It's really tasty.

2078
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,430
There are different types of kimchi.

2079
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:56,340
- They are frozen.
- It's so tasty.

2080
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:59,030
- There is young radish kimchi too.
- We will take this one.

2081
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,530
I want to carry around
a bowl of rice.

2082
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:03,010
- It would be tasty with rice.
- Right?

2083
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,640
Jae Suk, I want to carry around
a bowl of rice.

2084
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,140
- Thank you.
- All right.

2085
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:08,180
Thank you, Ma'am.

2086
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,490
How much is kimchi?

2087
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,140
- It's 10 dollars.
- It's 10 dollars.

2088
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:12,510
- It's so tasty.
- It's so tasty.

2089
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:13,660
What are these?

2090
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:16,160
They look delicious.

2091
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,450
I would be able to finish
a bowl of rice with them.

2092
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:22,490
Sand lance.
I want to taste the dish.

2093
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:24,320
- Taste it.
- Which one? This one?

2094
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,990
- Can we taste it?
- Yes. You can taste anything.

2095
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:29,470
We would fill our stomachs.

2096
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,530
We would fill our stomachs
at the market.

2097
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:33,610
- Hey, stop eating.
- Stop eating.

2098
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,850
- Stop eating.
- You won't be able to eat later...

2099
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,070
if you fill your stomach
at the market.

2100
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:42,090
The vendors are so generous
that they let us try the dishes.

2101
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:44,520
- What's this?
- Isn't it dried radish?

2102
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,590
She sells side dishes too.
It's spicy skate.

2103
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,690
- Try it.
- It would be tasty...

2104
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,260
(He gives Ji Hyo
a bite of spicy skate.)

2105
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:51,850
Hey, Jong Kook.

2106
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,800
(One bite for me)

2107
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,800
(One more bite for me)

2108
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,130
Let's go.

2109
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:59,440
- Ji Hyo.
- It must suit Jong Kook's taste.

2110
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,490
- Stop eating the side dishes.
- It's tasty.

2111
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:05,880
It's tasty.
You know what I mean, right?

2112
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,440
It would be so tasty with rice.

2113
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,510
Thank you.

2114
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,880
Jong Kook, stop eating.

2115
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:15,650
- Here.
- Let's go.

2116
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:18,310
It's okay.

2117
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:21,980
- You worked hard since morning.
- It's okay.

2118
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:24,130
Don't do that.

2119
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,850
- What?
- Don't do that.

2120
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,690
- What is it?
- Don't do that.

2121
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:30,130
Despite your words,
you aren't stopping her.

2122
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:31,990
Your hands are staying still.
Only your mouth is moving.

2123
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:33,440
- Don't do that.
- It's okay.

2124
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,160
- Ma'am, is that a freebie?
- Yes.

2125
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,340
- Don't give us so much.
- Just give us half of it.

2126
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,140
It seems to suit your taste.

2127
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:42,850
- This is driving me crazy.
- How much is it?

2128
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,010
- It's okay.
- She might give us more. Stop.

2129
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:47,570
- We should pay.
- Come on. Stop it already.

2130
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,650
- Don't eat what she needs to sell.
- It's tasty.

2131
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:52,910
- Do you have a bag?
- Where is the bag?

2132
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:55,150
- We have a bag.
- It's here.

2133
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:57,690
- Thank you.
- Hurry up and pay her.

2134
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:59,060
- No, it's okay.
- How much is it?

2135
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,950
- It's okay.
- We should pay.

2136
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,490
We should pay. How much is it?

2137
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,490
- I won't accept it.
- Why not?

2138
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,490
- I won't accept it.
- We should pay. How much is it?

2139
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:07,770
It's okay. I won't accept it.

2140
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,160
How much is it? One dollar?
Two dollars? Three dollars?

2141
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,730
How much is it?

2142
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:14,770
It's usually 30 dollars for 1kg.

2143
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:17,900
- Really?
- It's usually 30 dollars for 1kg.

2144
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:20,520
(Thirty dollars?)

2145
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,780
- Hey.
- Really?

2146
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,150
Why did you do that?

2147
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:25,810
- Why did you give us so much?
- Why did you give us so much?

2148
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:27,310
- Give us everything we own.
- Subtract that much.

2149
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,260
- It's okay.
- Give it to her.

2150
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,230
- Why did you give us so much?
- Good.

2151
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:32,800
- Let's go.
- Here you go.

2152
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,900
- It's okay.
- Come on. You should accept it.

2153
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,490
You should accept it.

2154
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:37,770
We accepted your love.

2155
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:40,560
- It was so tasty. I was surprised.
- We accepted your love.

2156
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,990
Keep it.

2157
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:44,860
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2158
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,380
- I will see you on TV.
- Thank you for the food.

2159
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,980
- Thank you for the food.
- Bye.

2160
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,270
- Ma'am, we will get going.
- Okay.

2161
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,070
- It was so tasty.
- Bye.

2162
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:54,270
We will get going. Bless you.

2163
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,440
Don't look at anything.

2164
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,810
- They keep giving us freebies.
- Skates are expensive.

2165
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:02,150
- Skates are expensive.
- Skates are expensive.

2166
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:04,320
- It was tasty.
- Jong Kook, why did you eat it?

2167
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,560
- We ended up buying it.
- What? I wanted to eat it.

2168
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:09,430
- She...
- I didn't know it was expensive.

2169
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,360
- The vendors gave us freebies.
- For goodness' sake.

2170
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,530
We need to pay for the donuts.

2171
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:17,230
Come to think of it,
we need to buy ramyeon.

2172
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,770
- Ramyeon.
- Ramyeon.

2173
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:21,700
- We should put ramyeon in the dish.
- That's right.

2174
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,510
- Or the dish will get ruined.
- That's right.

2175
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:24,570
- We need to put it.
- We need to buy ramyeon.

2176
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:26,680
- Pay back the vendor first.
- Hello.

2177
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,270
- Excuse me.
- Pay back the vendor first.

2178
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:29,890
We came to pay you back.

2179
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:31,740
- We came to buy ramyeon.
- Ramyeon.

2180
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,590
We will eat ramyeon in the end.

2181
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,630
My goodness, we bought everything.

2182
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,230
- Welcome back.
- Okay.

2183
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,150
We finished shopping
in the set amount of time.

2184
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:44,160
It was nice to feel the love.

2185
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,690
- I know. It was heartwarming.
- You know,

2186
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:46,990
- we learned...
- Seriously.

2187
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,160
how clueless we were
through Jong Kook.

2188
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,380
- I...
- "We will pay. How much is it?"

2189
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,570
- "Two dollars?"
- "Three dollars?"

2190
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:56,880
"Did you say 30 dollars?"

2191
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,070
I didn't know it was that expensive.

2192
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,520
- You didn't know.
- No.

2193
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,550
Skates are expensive.

2194
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:03,480
It's impossible not to eat
when you walk around the market.

2195
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,190
Seriously. You could easily spend
an hour or two...

2196
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:06,910
- at the market.
- There are so many tasty snacks.

2197
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,690
It's fun to spend time
at the market.

2198
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:10,060
- It's fun.
- There is so much food.

2199
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,490
- You don't spend that much money.
- That's right.

2200
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:15,970
It would be incredible
to eat gukbap in the morning.

2201
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:16,990
Beef gukbap.

2202
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:19,660
If you order kalguksu at the market,
you get a giant bowl.

2203
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:22,160
That's right.
Imagine eating beef gukbap...

2204
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,940
with kimchi.

2205
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:25,880
- It would be incredible.
- My goodness.

2206
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,340
Suk Jin, when did you eat that?

2207
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,810
I... Beef gukbap and kimchi?

2208
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:34,070
- "I..."
- My goodness.

2209
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:36,240
Suk Jin, come on.

2210
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:38,240
- Why do you keep lying?
- Be quiet.

2211
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,720
Why do you keep lying?

2212
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,850
I suddenly wanted to eat it.

2213
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:42,060
- It wasn't a lie.
- Suk Jin.

2214
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,450
You like Japanese food.

2215
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:46,130
You prefer izakaya.

2216
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:48,130
You are wrong. It's not like that.

2217
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,490
You can't eat anything
other than omakase.

2218
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:51,900
That was so funny.

2219
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,900
It would be nice
to have a date at the market.

2220
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,700
- It would be nice.
- Many people do it.

2221
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:56,770
Many young people do it.

2222
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,360
Many young people do it, right?
It sounds great.

2223
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,140
- Gen Zers do it.
- Many people do it.

2224
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,140
They line up at Mangwon Market
early in the morning.

2225
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,510
- Really?
- They keep eating.

2226
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:06,240
Do you know what's funny about Haha?

2227
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,380
He always talks about Gen Zers.

2228
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,440
Young people.

2229
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:13,110
Gen Zers, those punks like it.

2230
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,980
Your nickname, Blowfly, suits you.

2231
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,650
- You...
- You punks, do you like the market?

2232
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:21,150
You keep circling Gen Zers.

2233
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:22,900
- Blowfly.
- You know...

2234
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:26,340
You circle them, right?
Gen Zers recognized me.

2235
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,690
- Same here. Gen Zers pay me.
- Hey.

2236
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:30,970
When you live stream,

2237
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:33,070
you get 2 dollars and 1 dollar.

2238
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:35,070
That's right. Don't use me.

2239
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:36,380
Seriously.

2240
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,740
- I get ten dollars these days.
- I was going to say that.

2241
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,680
Why are you begging
when you are a celebrity?

2242
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,810
- I can't believe you.
- What are you doing?

2243
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:45,350
To get recognized by them,
I need to accept money.

2244
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:48,690
Someone suggested ten dollars
for saying, "I am a fool."

2245
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,430
- Ten dollars?
- Then Haha...

2246
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:53,230
Upon hearing those words,
Haha went insane.

2247
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:54,820
"I am a fool!"

2248
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,860
(An actual footage
from his live streaming)

2249
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,800
(I got it.)

2250
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,140
I am a fool!

2251
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:04,360
"I am a fool!"

2252
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,900
(Suk Jin monitored it.)

2253
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:08,510
- I am a fool!
- Hey.

2254
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,070
- Haha.
- I have the money.

2255
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,270
But ten dollars are a big deal
in that scene.

2256
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:15,690
I can call anyone "Big brother"
for ten dollars.

2257
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:18,480
I can't believe him.

2258
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,310
- I sent him money in the beginning.
- Really?

2259
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,950
So Haha danced for me.

2260
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,950
(A capitalistic talent show)

2261
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:27,760
How do I see it?
I will send you 100 dollars.

2262
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,400
If you send 100 dollars,
you will be called the president.

2263
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,470
You will be called President Ji.

2264
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:33,690
I will send 100 dollars.

2265
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:35,490
- Get the title for 1,000 dollars.
- It will be insane.

2266
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:36,810
I really want to do it.

2267
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:39,230
- So Min.
- That's so funny.

2268
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:42,270
Haha is drawing a snowman.

2269
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,380
(Cute)

2270
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:46,180
- I drew a star.
- A star?

2271
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,070
- What will you draw?
- Me?

2272
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:50,020
I used to kiss the window.

2273
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:52,150
- That's right.
- When? Why?

2274
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:53,810
- I just wanted to see the lips.
- The lips.

2275
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:55,690
- Whose lips?
- My lips.

2276
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:58,650
You wanted to see your own lips.

2277
01:14:58,850 --> 01:15:00,150
Suk Jin.

2278
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:01,800
- Why?
- The lips.

2279
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,860
Why did you make the kissing sound?

2280
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:05,430
Suk Jin, even your lips look old.

2281
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:08,530
- Even your lips look old.
- Hey.

2282
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:10,060
Your lips look thin.

2283
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,530
- His nose left an imprint too.
- My nose left an imprint.

2284
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:14,770
Even your lips look old.

2285
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,270
In my 20s, I drew a heart like this.

2286
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:20,380
- Why? Were you hungry for love?
- I can't draw a heart.

2287
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,980
- Back then,
- Were you hungry for love?

2288
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,610
it was a mysterious realm.

2289
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:24,910
Was love a mysterious realm?

2290
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:27,410
- It was back then.
- Back then,

2291
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:29,260
he didn't have much to do.

2292
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:31,320
When Suk Jin was talking,
Ji Hyo did this.

2293
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,430
(She cared more about her earwax.)

2294
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,520
- Ji Hyo, did his words bother you?
- No.

2295
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,130
Doesn't "A mysterious realm"
sound strange?

2296
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,800
- He met a woman named Mi Ji.
- A mysterious realm.

2297
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:41,990
- Mi Ji?
- The homophone could be a name.

2298
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:44,700
Lee Mi Ji. It's a common name
from our generation.

2299
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,980
- Lee Mi Ji.
- Lee Mi Ji.

2300
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,010
Jung Eun Sook, Kim Yoo Kyung...

2301
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:50,180
He is naming his ex-girlfriends.

2302
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,070
- It's not like that.
- Are they your ex-girlfriends?

2303
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:54,480
- Bleep out the names.
- It's not like that.

2304
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,980
- You don't need to do that.
- Bleep out the names.

2305
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,440
- They aren't my ex-girlfriends.
- You are open-minded.

2306
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,910
- You are cool.
- They aren't my ex-girlfriends.

2307
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:01,480
- He revealed the names.
- Those names were common.

2308
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,260
- How about...
- My goodness.

2309
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:04,730
That name wasn't
from our generation.

2310
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:06,850
- It must be from our generation.
- Did you date...

2311
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:07,950
They should bleep out this name.

2312
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,060
You must have dated her.

2313
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:12,360
Please bleep out this name.

2314
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,490
- I suddenly remembered.
- The look in So Min's eyes changed.

2315
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:15,660
I suddenly remembered.

2316
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,440
- It was my ex's name.
- Seriously.

2317
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,770
- We need to cook now.
- Jae Suk,

2318
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:21,770
we won't be able to eat
if we begin building a fire.

2319
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:22,940
All right. Who will cook rice?

2320
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,600
- Se Chan and So Min.
- So Min.

2321
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:28,050
The two of you should take
the initiative.

2322
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,650
- Let's make the dough.
- The rest of us...

2323
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:31,190
- will make the dough.
- The dough.

2324
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,390
Then I will grill...

2325
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,060
pollack and sand lance.

2326
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:39,130
- As for the sauce,
- You are in charge of the broth.

2327
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,350
- The broth?
- Pollack and...

2328
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,690
I am good at making it now.

2329
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,690
Ji Hyo, I don't think...

2330
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:47,400
- you should get ahead of yourself.
- I think...

2331
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,840
- she should take a nap.
- Consult with the others.

2332
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,140
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

2333
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:52,400
Can you make the broth well
this time?

2334
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,440
Yes, Jae Suk.

2335
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,100
There is
only a handful of anchovies.

2336
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,680
I don't know why...

2337
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,440
I thought she was a good cook.

2338
01:16:58,680 --> 01:16:59,740
I thought that too.

2339
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,220
Can you make a fried egg?

2340
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,980
- Of course.
- Really?

2341
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:05,650
I know that you can make it,
but can you make it pretty?

2342
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:07,780
I bet Ji Hyo hasn't made
a fried egg.

2343
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,930
You just need to use a lot of oil
to make a fried egg.

2344
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:13,300
- Paik Jong Won did that.
- No.

2345
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,320
- Paik Jong Won.
- That's how you fry it.

2346
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,100
- That's how you avoid failure.
- That's how you fry it.

2347
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,130
- Right?
- Hey.

2348
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:18,190
Do you want to try it then?

2349
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:19,900
Do you know how to make it
in the tastiest way?

2350
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:22,840
It's healthy if you use water
instead of oil.

2351
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,100
If you are going to worry
about health,

2352
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,880
- you should quit smoking.
- Seriously.

2353
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,440
That's exactly what my wife says.

2354
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,600
I can't say anything to her.

2355
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,900
"Why did you open the window?"

2356
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,550
"Fine dust is bad for you."

2357
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,240
"You should quit smoking."

2358
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,940
"Isn't this old?"

2359
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:39,480
"Just quit smoking."

2360
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:41,280
- I see.
- Every household is similar.

2361
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,090
- Let's say I call someone.
- Right?

2362
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:44,630
Even if it's about work,

2363
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:46,820
Kyung Eun goes,
"Why are you chitchatting so much?"

2364
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,150
(A reasonable doubt)

2365
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:51,300
"Hey, it was about work."

2366
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,340
- "I doubt it."
- "Why are you chitchatting?"

2367
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,900
- At home?
- Yes.

2368
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,470
Jae Suk has so many people to call.

2369
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,840
- I have so many people to call.
- Yes.

2370
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,650
Your schedule must have been tight
last week.

2371
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:04,740
I was busy last week.

2372
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,070
- I was supposed to call So Min.
- He couldn't do it.

2373
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:08,310
- I couldn't do it.
- His schedule was too tight.

2374
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,610
I was too busy.

2375
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:12,610
This place is so pretty.

2376
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:14,780
It's nice. It's the best.

2377
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,980
This place is so pretty.

2378
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:18,950
It's so pretty.

2379
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,820
I feel like I am in a fairy tale.

2380
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,770
(The location of their retreat is
at the foot of a snowy mountain.)

2381
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:24,970
Hello.

2382
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:26,340
The air is nice here.

2383
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:27,730
- Hello.
- My goodness.

2384
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:29,940
- Hello. The air is nice here.
- At a place like this...

2385
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:31,160
- Hello.
- My goodness.

2386
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,600
- This place is nice.
- It's pretty.

2387
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,940
- Hello.
- It's pretty.

2388
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,560
- It's pretty.
- This place is really nice.

2389
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,820
- How pretty.
- We are in Pyeongchang.

2390
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:39,820
- This is the beginning.
- How nice.

2391
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:42,530
- We are in Pyeongchang.
- It's like a chicken restaurant.

2392
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:44,190
The vibe is similar.

2393
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,230
There is gas today.

2394
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:48,190
We won't be able to eat on time.

2395
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,070
Let's just take a nap later.

2396
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,230
- There are pollacks.
- You know what to do, right?

2397
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:53,980
- There are pollacks.
- With a hammer or a bat,

2398
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:56,110
- you need to beat it.
- You need to beat it.

2399
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,180
That's right.

2400
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:59,040
You need to tenderize it.

2401
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,040
It's really hard.

2402
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:04,610
Do we need to build a fire
when there is a gas stove?

2403
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,150
There is a gas stove.

2404
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,520
Building a fire is the basic step.

2405
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,430
This place is so pretty.

2406
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,230
- Now,
- Yes?

2407
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,260
- let's build a fire.
- Okay.

2408
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:15,100
(They begin to prepare lunch
before looking around the lodging.)

2409
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,570
We have a tight schedule.

2410
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:19,100
Who has the recipe?

2411
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,470
For lunch, we are having
dried pollack kimchi sujebi,

2412
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:23,860
grilled pollack,
and grilled Korean sand lance.

2413
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,780
Dried pollack kimchi sujebi
sounds delicious.

2414
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:29,680
(The hardest one is the main dish,
dried pollack kimchi sujebi.)

2415
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:32,010
It's dried pollack kimchi sujebi,

2416
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:34,020
but it will become
dried pollack kimchi ramyeon.

2417
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,040
How do we make the dough?

2418
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,390
Didn't you make sujebi
when you were little?

2419
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,020
Sujebi is tasty.

2420
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:40,520
- Yes.
- It's tasty when you make it.

2421
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,260
(Rinse the dried pollack and cover it
with a cloth for 10 minutes.)

2422
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,860
- Pollack will be delicious.
- Dried pollack is delicious.

2423
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,230
You need to grill it
over the briquette fire.

2424
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,530
You need to grill it
on the gridiron.

2425
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:49,470
(Beat it with a wooden bat.)

2426
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:53,270
(Then tear it
into bite-sized pieces.)

2427
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:56,360
(Will they be able
to follow the process properly?)

2428
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,860
Where is the frying pan?

2429
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,530
- Are we using a cauldron?
- There they are.

2430
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:01,070
There they are.

2431
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:02,480
- The ingredients.
- The kitchen is here.

2432
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,740
- Tell me what you need.
- The kitchen is here.

2433
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,540
Haha, give me...

2434
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,940
- a cutting board.
- A cutting board?

2435
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,220
- Firstly...
- You startled me.

2436
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,690
- A cutting board and a knife.
- We need to make it.

2437
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:14,580
- We need to make the dough.
- That's right.

2438
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:15,890
Give me a bowl.

2439
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,150
The dough.

2440
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:19,120
(Team Cooking
gets the kitchen tools.)

2441
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,150
Let's take all of them.

2442
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,290
(Team Cooking
gets the kitchen tools.)

2443
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:23,070
Hold on. Now...

2444
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:24,770
(Team Fire gets the torch.)

2445
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:27,660
We should put the kindling
at the bottom.

2446
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:28,660
(Excited)

2447
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:30,270
There they go again.

2448
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,010
The two members who love fire...

2449
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:33,810
- A meal of the netherworld.
- Okay.

2450
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:35,700
The two members
who are obsessed with fire...

2451
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,700
Good.

2452
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,240
- Turn it.
- We should do it there.

2453
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,280
Good.

2454
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,480
It's working.

2455
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,410
Jae Suk.

2456
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:44,540
Jae Suk. Hold on.

2457
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,980
Did you add charcoal briquette?

2458
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:48,820
- No.
- You didn't, right?

2459
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,450
- You need to use it.
- The firewood...

2460
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:52,760
- Hold on.
- The firewood is dry.

2461
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,950
- It catches fire easily.
- I get that. Jae Suk.

2462
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,290
Hold on.

2463
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:58,030
Jae Suk, hold on.

2464
01:20:58,030 --> 01:20:59,940
- All right.
- Let's put them at the bottom.

2465
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:01,970
- My goodness.
- Let's put them at the bottom.

2466
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:03,770
Let's put them at the bottom.

2467
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:06,480
- One? Two? Just one?
- One.

2468
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:07,780
All set. Hold on.

2469
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,400
- Be careful.
- Here.

2470
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:10,810
Let's pile them up nicely.

2471
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:12,400
Use these.

2472
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:14,850
- What?
- Use these.

2473
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:16,110
(They met their goggles again.)

2474
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,720
These goggles? Okay.

2475
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,450
They are working
without being asked.

2476
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:22,820
They are cute. They like fire.

2477
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:24,690
(The woodfire enthusiasts
build a fire happily.)

2478
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:26,600
- What are you doing?
- Now,

2479
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:28,860
we need to peel the potatoes.

2480
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,820
- Shall I do it? I will do it.
- I will do it.

2481
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:31,990
It's okay. I will do it.

2482
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:34,440
JI Hyo, you need to remove
the anchovy innards.

2483
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,970
Okay. I will do that...

2484
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,110
while they build a fire.

2485
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,860
Where is the sink?

2486
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,140
(They are more organized
than they were the last time.)

2487
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,530
I need to take off my shoes, right?
There it is.

2488
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,850
Can't we cook here?

2489
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,150
(Skilled)

2490
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,440
All done.

2491
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,220
(While Chef Yang focuses on
preparing the ingredients)

2492
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,760
We need to beat the dried pollacks.

2493
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,980
(Jae Suk diverts his attention
to the dried pollacks.)

2494
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,730
Where should we beat
the dried pollacks?

2495
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,530
I will beat the dried pollacks.

2496
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,290
You are cool.

2497
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:10,010
(Martial arts with dried pollacks)

2498
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:12,510
- Gosh, Jae Suk.
- Hey.

2499
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,570
(Flippant)

2500
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,570
I see that you were born flippant.

2501
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:17,870
He was born that way.

2502
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,240
It can't be helped.

2503
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:21,020
He was born that way.

2504
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,410
You were born flippant.

2505
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:25,320
- He was born that way.
- He was born mischievous.

2506
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,860
- He was born mischievous.
- He can't help it.

2507
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,280
I bet...

2508
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,560
Jae Suk kicked a lot
when he was in his mom's belly.

2509
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,360
- You did that, right?
- My children are the same.

2510
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:35,530
My children are so mischievous.

2511
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:37,600
- Na Eun too?
- Na Eun is mischievous.

2512
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,900
(His children got
the mischievous genes.)

2513
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,140
Seriously.

2514
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:42,230
You love fire so much.

2515
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,160
- I need to build a fire.
- I feel like peeing.

2516
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:46,400
When I came here,

2517
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,180
I felt the desire to pee.

2518
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:49,700
- What did you feel?
- The desire to pee.

2519
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:52,370
- Suk Jin, what's that?
- It's strange.

2520
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:53,870
- The desire to pee?
- Just now...

2521
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:55,440
What do you even mean by that?

2522
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,020
I was so surprised.

2523
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:58,820
They say you feel like peeing
when you play with fire.

2524
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,580
Shouldn't you feel the desire to eat
when you see a fire?

2525
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:02,360
Let's make the dough.

2526
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,930
(He suppresses his desire to pee
and begins to make the dough.)

2527
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,360
(He mixes flour and water.)

2528
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:14,640
- Hey, the sujabi...
- What's "Sujabi?"

2529
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:17,010
What's "Sujabi?"

2530
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:18,230
Will you eat a lot of sujebi?

2531
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:19,830
(His tongue got crushed
like the dough.)

2532
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:21,900
My words come out wrong
these days too.

2533
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,810
I know how you feel, Suk Jin.

2534
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:25,900
It's not like that.

2535
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,240
I don't have a problem at home.
It only happens when I am here.

2536
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,650
(While everyone is focused on
"Sujabi,")

2537
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:32,980
(Jae Suk begins to beat
the dried pollacks.)

2538
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,760
(Breaking)

2539
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:42,400
Jae Suk, it's falling apart.

2540
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,230
Jae Suk, why are you destroying it?

2541
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:47,470
- Hey.
- It should be soaked in water.

2542
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:49,160
- What?
- It should be soaked in water...

2543
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,230
before you beat it.

2544
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:52,570
- Hey.
- I thought I could just beat it.

2545
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:54,780
The dried pollack became powder.

2546
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:57,570
I see.
You should have told me sooner.

2547
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:58,650
The dried pollack became powder.

2548
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:01,870
I have never made
dried pollack soup before.

2549
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,350
- Don't do that.
- Do I microwave it for a minute?

2550
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,040
Isn't this enough?

2551
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,110
- Why are you adding rice powder?
- What?

2552
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:08,480
Jae Suk.

2553
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,820
- Why are you adding rice powder?
- What?

2554
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,690
- Jae Suk.
- What?

2555
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:13,650
- What?
- It looks like you.

2556
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,070
- Jae Suk.
- I can't do it otherwise.

2557
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:18,100
- What should I do?
- You need to rinse it...

2558
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,100
and cover it with a cloth.

2559
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,160
That way, it becomes moist.

2560
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:21,790
- Is this sticky enough?
- What should I do?

2561
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,230
- Add a bit of oil.
- I mean...

2562
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,160
- You need to knead it more.
- I need to add water, right?

2563
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,610
- Add a bit of oil...
- Give it here.

2564
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:27,680
- to the dough.
- Hey.

2565
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,700
- You need to knead it for a while.
- Add a bit of oil.

2566
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,780
- It needs to be aged.
- Add a bit of oil.

2567
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:32,980
- No.
- Here.

2568
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:34,850
It's not like that. Give it to me.

2569
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,080
It's not like that.
It needs more water.

2570
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,580
- No. Add a bit of oil.
- Water.

2571
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:40,950
- No. Don't add water.
- So Min, what should I do?

2572
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,280
- Oil?
- I will go and rinse them.

2573
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:44,150
- Should I rinse 2?
- Rinse 3.

2574
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:45,560
- Give me one more.
- I am done.

2575
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:46,820
- Are you done?
- Yes.

2576
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:48,060
- We can add them now.
- All done.

2577
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,570
- I am done.
- Cook the rice now.

2578
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:50,860
Let's eat now.

2579
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:53,030
Cook ramyeon.
We are going to eat ramyeon anyway.

2580
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:54,100
Get the water going.

2581
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,790
The dough is ready.
We don't have much time.

2582
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:56,940
(Will they be able
to cook the meal on time?)

2583
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:58,530
I shouldn't have shattered it...

2584
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:00,700
- by beating it.
- I mean...

2585
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:02,330
- Jae Suk, just add it.
- It became powder.

2586
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,810
It can be used for the broth.

2587
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:05,680
- Let's make the broth with it.
- The broth.

2588
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,240
(Ji Hyo only thinks about the broth
as she removes the anchovy innards.)

2589
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,320
- Since it might be a waste...
- We can make broth with this.

2590
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,690
(So Min washes dried pollacks
as the recipe says.)

2591
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:15,890
Soak it in water? Wash it and...

2592
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:17,530
(Wash dried pollack and cover it
with a cloth for 10 minutes.)

2593
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:18,760
Wash it?

2594
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,360
(Steamy)

2595
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,900
Wash it like this?

2596
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,900
(She's supposed to wash it,
but she's blanching it.)

2597
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,900
Bowl. Suk Jin.

2598
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:30,700
- So Bal.
- Suk Jin.

2599
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,160
Haha, you should...

2600
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,400
cover this with a cloth.
We will beat it when it's soaked.

2601
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,850
Hang on. I'll wash them all.

2602
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:37,850
Cover what with a cloth?

2603
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:40,020
I don't know. I'll wash these first.

2604
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:41,650
Read this.

2605
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,610
I'll wash them.
Before you beat it...

2606
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,080
We don't have any cloth,
so we will use a towel.

2607
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,520
Okay. And get me another bowl.

2608
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,190
I'll wash the Korean sand lance.

2609
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,980
- Okay.
- Get me another bowl.

2610
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,230
(The next scapegoat is
Korean sand lance.)

2611
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:57,660
How should I gut these?
I've never done this before.

2612
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,120
This is...

2613
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:03,270
How should I gut these?
I've never done it before. I'm in trouble.

2614
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,140
This is...

2615
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,700
We will boil water now.

2616
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,650
Don't put in too much water.

2617
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,200
Of course, I won't.

2618
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,200
(His eyes are fixed.)

2619
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,610
- Jong Kook.
- Yes.

2620
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:16,110
- Turn on the gas.
- Okay.

2621
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:19,580
- It's nice to have him for fire.
- Here? I should turn it on.

2622
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:22,260
We don't have time.

2623
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,150
We should make broth.

2624
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:25,150
(At this rate, they will take a nap
before they finish cooking.)

2625
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:26,320
All right.

2626
01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:29,060
- Good.
- Put this in the center.

2627
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,970
There's something in the water.
Is that all right?

2628
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:33,570
- It's okay.
- The pot has some oil on it.

2629
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:35,070
- It won't kill you.
- The pot has oil on it?

2630
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:36,530
- What do we do with the fire?
- It always has some oil on it.

2631
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:39,400
- Do you want me to turn it up?
- Turn it up.

2632
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:43,740
I'll make broth
with the dried pollack.

2633
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,780
- Okay.
- That's not a bad idea.

2634
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:46,850
Right?

2635
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:49,110
(He puts it in after discussing it
with everyone.)

2636
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:50,350
(Floating alone)

2637
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:51,610
Put in the whole pollack.

2638
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:52,890
You can't put in the whole thing.

2639
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:54,360
- It's okay.
- You can't put it in like that.

2640
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,060
- Just put it.
- You can't do this.

2641
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,860
- It's all right.
- No.

2642
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:01,150
Why can't I put it in
when you already did?

2643
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:02,950
(They start squabbling
over the broth again.)

2644
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,070
Why not?

2645
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:06,690
Let's not make the same mistake.

2646
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:09,070
Don't do anything
that can upset others.

2647
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:10,570
We already made the mistake before.

2648
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:12,010
It can be really upsetting.

2649
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:13,010
Why can't you tell
the proper amount of water?

2650
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:14,010
No, this is okay.

2651
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:15,230
(People always...)

2652
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,310
(repeat the same mistake.)

2653
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,740
(As they blame others out of habit,)

2654
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,780
(they lose cooperative spirit.)

2655
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,440
(They can get
a penalty transfer card?)

2656
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,440
Let's make it happen no matter what.

2657
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:27,360
(They have to finish everything
in an hour and a half.)

2658
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,450
(They are in a hurry,
so they don't care about the taste.)

2659
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:32,360
(The opportunity ends
once the bell rings.)

2660
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,600
(Will they be able to eat?)

2661
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,620
(From 12:00 p.m. to 12:40 p.m.: Nap time)

2662
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:37,070
(Cranky)

2663
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:39,120
I'm so annoyed.

2664
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:41,690
(The spoiled members)

2665
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:44,640
(The tight schedule continues.)

2666
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,140
(To get the penalty transfer card,)

2667
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:47,440
(they struggle in their bare feet.)

2668
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:50,040
(They get carried away.)

2669
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:52,540
(They laugh.)

2670
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,940
(They cry.)

2671
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:56,720
(And they laugh.
It's such a strange retreat.)

2672
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,150
(Will it end peacefully?)

2673
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:01,450
(The Precious Retreat)
